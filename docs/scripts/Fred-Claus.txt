INT. MEDIEVAL HOME - 1700 YEARS AGO (GIVE OR TAKE)

We open in the center of a MEDIEVAL HOME. Quarters are
tight. A stone hearth sits in the middle� �of the room.

Next to the hearth sits a MOTHER, ruddy-cheeked and
hearty.  She is in the middle of a painful labor,
attended to by a MIDWIFE. Next to them sits the FATHER -
a small bald man, extremely worried.

                           NARRATOR. (V. 0.)
             You've probably heard many stories that
             begin a long long time ago, in a land far
             far away. This one does as well. But I
             assure you: this is a story you haven't
             heard before.   It is the story of a boy
             named Fred. And it begins right here.

The Mother SCREAMS in pain.

                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)
             You must excuse Fred's mother. You see,
             back in the middle ages, having a baby
             was much harder.  There were no
             hospitals, no medicines for pain. The
             only thing that remains the same today as
             it was back then, was the father's role
             in the birth process.

                          MOTHER
                    (to Father)
             YOU MISERABLE SWINE! LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE
             DONE TO ME! ONE NIGHT YOU DRINK ALE AND
             FEEL ROMANTIC! ONE NIGHT! AND LOOK AT
             ME!  I'M GIVING BIRTH TO AN OXEN!

As always,    the Father remains calm and nurturing.

                             FATHER
             My dear wife,    I assure you I feel your
             agony.

                          MOTHER
             YOU WANT TO FEEL MY AGONY? GO OUTSIDE,
             PLUCK A TEN POUND POTATO, SWALLOW IT
             WHOLE, AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER
             END!!!.

                             MIDWIFE
             It is time.     You must push, Dear.   Push.

One last gigantic PUSH.  The midwife pulls back holding
something.  She looks at the yet unseen baby, astonished:

                             MOTHER
             What is it!?     What is wrong?
                                                         2.



                       MIDWIFE
             �   (stunned)
          He is the fattest baby I have ever seen.

The parents GASP, relieved. They look down at their
newborn child. The BABY is revealed.  He really is the
absolute fattest baby of all time. Nevertheless, he's
adorable. Smiling even. His cheeks are rosy and
flushed, just like his mother.

                       FATHER
          Why does he not cry?

They look back down at their smiling newborn. The baby
opens his mouth, about to cry. But instead of crying ...

                        BABY
          Ho, ho, ho.

Stunned, the midwife CROSSES herself. The mother picks
up her baby. His weight stuns her as well.

                        MOTHER
          Oh, good Lord.
                 (then)
          He's perfect in every way.   What will we
          name him?

                       FATHER
          My father was called Nicholas.

                       MOTHER
          Nicholas. Yes. Nicholas Claus.    My
          Saint Nicholas.

The parents take in their child, blissful. Suddenly,
they hear a RUSTLING in the corner of the room.  It
causes Father Claus to realize they've forgotten ...

                       FATHER CLAUS
          Frederick? Would you like to come and
          meet your brother?

Everyone turns to the corner of the room.

ANGLE ON FRED

For the first time we reveal a scrawny, tow-headed boy in
the corner - FREDERICK Claus. Biting his nails, Fred
nervously steps forward. Hesitantly, he takes a very
heavy Nicholas in his arms.
                                                             3.



 ------------i'ARRA'WR---------
           Fred loved Nicholas from the first moment
           he met him.   In fact, that day he made
           him a promise

Fred holds Nicholas up - face to face.    He kisses him on
the forehead.

                        FRED
           I promise to be the best big brother in
           the world, Nicholas.

                        NICHOLAS
          Ho, ho, ho.

The family LAUGHS and coddles the new baby.

                        NARRATOR
          But Fred's promise is just the beginning
          of his story.   You see, sometimes it's
          easier to make a promise than it is to
          keep one.

                                                      CUT TO:


EXT. THE CLAUS HOME - SIX YEARS LATER

The family sits around their pine tree filled backyard.
It's a MEDIEVAL BIRTHDAY PARTY. Nicholas (now six, and
even fatter) is the center of attention, surrounded by
friends and gifts.   Fred, now twelve, approaches him.
Fred holds a GIFT of his own.

                       FRED
          Happy birthday, Nicholas.     I made this
          for you.

                       NICHOLAS
          Why thank you, Frederick!

Nicholas HUGS Fred.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          That was very nice of you, Frederick.
                 (then, noticing)
          Where are you going Nicholas?

Nicholas has SCOOPED UP all his gifts (including Fred's).

                       NICHOLAS
          There's a poor orphan name Henry who
          lives down the road.  I'm bringing all my
          gifts to him. He needs them more than I.
                                                              4.




                          MOTHER CLAUS
          Why Nicholas!     Isn't that lovely?!

Fred looks confused.
                       FRED
          Do you really think Henry needs a leather
          journal with the name Nicholas on the
          cover?

                        MOTHER CLAUS
          Oh. Frederick, stop being difficult. It's
          a saintly thing he did. My little Saint
          Nicholas!
Mother Claus wraps Nicholas in a bear hug. Almost
sympathetically, Father Claus PATS Fred on the shoulder.

                                                         CUT TO:


INT. THE CLAUS HOME - MONTHS LATER

Fred comes downstairs, wearing a new suit.        He looks
adorable.
                       NARRATOR
          And so it went for Fred. Every time he
          managed to make his parents proud

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          Why Frederick, don't you look nice?

                       FATHER CLAUS
          A real gentleman, Son.

                       NARRATOR
          Nicholas managed to make his parents even
          prouder.
Nicholas plops out of the CHIMNEY. He's wearing a
ridiculous RED JUMPSUIT - almost a one-sie.

                       NICHOLAS
          The door was locked so I decided to drop
          down the chimney. How fun!

                        MOTHER CLAUS
          Nicholas!    Don't you look dashing!?

Fred tilts his head to look at his brother.        In truth, he
kind of looks like an idiot.
                                                            5.



�-�-����������-�-��������------ NI.CHOLAS.--��--------------
                 1 sewed it myself.  I know money is tight
                 this year so I used the left-over fabric
                 from your drapery, Mother.

                         MOTHER CLAUS
            Well, you look just lovely in red. It's
            definitely your color. Making your own
            clothes! You really are too much,
            Nicholas.

  Mother Claus runs to Nicholas and wraps him in another
  hug.  Fred has busied himself LOOKING UP the chimney.

                         FRED
            If the door was locked, why didn't you
            just knock?

                         MOTHER CLAUS
            Because he's inventive, Frederick!  You
            know, you really should try and be more
            like your brother.

  Father Claus PATS Fred on the shoulder once again and
  follows his wife toward Nicholas.

                                                      CUT TO:


  EXT. THE CLAUS HOME - DAYTIME

  We pan up a large pine tree in a field.  At the top, Fred
  sits on a branch next to a self-made BIRDHOUSE.   The
  birdhouse is bright blue with yellow stripes.   Intricate.
  And feeding in the house is a beautiful BLUEBIRD.

                          FRED
                   (to bird)
            I don't wish to hate him. He means well.
            And I promised to be the best big brother
            in the world.

  The bird looks at Fred, his head askew.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
            You're the only one who understands me,
            Chirp-Chirp.

  The bluebird CHIRPS twice.  Fred smiles.  But then he
  hears something: a SAWING NOISE. And just like that ...
  the tree (with Fred in it) WIPES the frame.

  ON THE GROUND
                                                                                    6.



---wheJSe----F-Jee                                 NICHOLAS
                     Frederick! I thought you were playing in
                     the fields! Are you alright!?

       Fred NODS,     too dazed to respond.

                                  NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
                     I noticed how much you liked that tree
                     and I knew winter was approaching, so I
                     had the men chop it down and now we're
                     going to bring it inside the house and
                     put presents under it!  Isn't that
                     wonderful? Frederick?

      Fred isn't listening. He walks toward the tree.   He
      finds his birdhouse, SMASHED to pieces, under a branch.
      He looks up in the air. The bluebird HOVERS there for a
      moment, then flies away, never to return.

      Fred looks at his brother, turns, and walks away.

                                                                             CUT TO:


       INT. THE CLAUS HOME - EVENING

      Fred's giant tree is CRAMMED into the tiny room,
      literally engulfing it. The family sits under the tree,
      opening presents. Fred skulks in the corner.

                                  NARRATOR
                     Ah, poor Fred. That tree was the last
                     straw. He began to resent his brother,
                     and his parents, and even his life. And
                     like many unhappy children, he became
                     angry. Naughty even.

      Fred THROWS an apple across the room, hitting Nicholas in
      the back.  Though his parents don't notice, Nicholas
      turns and sees what Fred did. Nicholas' face drops - he
      doesn't want his brother to hate him.

                                 FATHER CLAUS
                     What's the matter, Nicholas?

                                  NICHOLAS
                            (sadly, covering)
                     Nothing.
                                                               7.




_____________ _ N b . R M T ~ ~ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _____ �--
            But while Fred grew worse and worse,
            Nicholas grew even more generous�, and
            eventually, he fulfilled his mother's
            prophesy.  In manhood, he literally
            became a saint.

 A MONTAGE OF FAMILY PORTRAITS (as the family grows older)
 covers the rest of the narration.   In the portraits, Fred
 become progressively more sullen whereas Nicholas (always
 in red) becomes jollier and fatter.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)
            Now it's a little known rule of
            sainthood, but when you become a saint,
            you freeze in time, eternally ageless.
            It's an even lesser known fact, but the
            rule applies to immediate family of the
            saint as well - parents and siblings.
            Now you probably already have your
            suspicions of what became of Saint Nick.
            You may even have heard a story or two
            about him. But as I told you before,
            this is a story about Fred. And the next
            part of Fred's story occurs in a time and
            place that might be a little more
            familiar to you ...

                                                          CUT TO:

 We're CLOSE ON a quaint, quiet CHRISTMAS VILLAGE. We
 PULL BACK, revealing that the village is actually a
 Christmas display in a Macy's Window.


 EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

 A CAPTION reads: New York City, December 16th, 2005.

 We PULL AWAY from the window and TRACK our shot down the
 street, passing Christmas displays in every store-front.
 Santa Claus is everywhere, a legend.

 An adult FRED CLAUSE stands grimacing in front of one
 such window. He's at the famous MANHATTAN FAO SCHWARTZ.
 Fred is disheveled and sarcastic looking - centuries of
 being overshadowed have clearly taken their toll.

 A LITTLE GIRL drags her mother toward the toy store.

                          LITTLE GIRL
            Mommy, Mommy!    Can we go see Santa? I
            love Santa so much!    I want to see Santa!
                                                                          8.

                         about Santa?

            The girl nods eagerly.      Her mother smiles.

                                      FRBD (CONT'D)
                         He peed his bed until he was seven.

            The mother pulls her away.      Fred smiles and continues on.


            EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - LATER

            Fred CRINGES at the sight of the ROCKEFELLER CENTER TREE.
            He approaches the corner of a street where CAROLERS sing
            Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  Fred interrupts.

                                      FRED
                         Excuse me? I was just wondering: have
                         you all ever thought about the lyrics
                         you're singing? "He knows when you 1 ve
                         been sleeping, he knows when you're
                         awake." If that's not serious Big
                         Brother propaganda, I don't know what is.

                                      CAROLER
                         It's just a song, Man.

                                      FRED
                         Yes.   And Mein Kampf was just" a book.

            A few carolers GASP in horror.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)
                                (smiling)
                         Merry Christmas.

            Leaving them stunned, Fred walks away and hails a cab.
                                                                     CUT TO:


            INT. TAXI CAB - LATER

            Fred sits in back. Up front, A FOREIGN CABBIE wears a
            red Santa hat. On the radio, Here Comes Santa Claus
            plays. The cabbie SINGS along in a heavy accent.

                                      FRED
                         You mind changing the station?

            The Cabbie looks at Fred, annoyed. He switches the
            station.  Jingle Bells plays. As he starts singing
                                                                    9.



--�-�- -------------------,cRELJ-{-GQNT-'-DH--------~
                     Change it, please.

       Irritated the cabbie changes the station once more. Now
       Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer plays.  The cabbie sings
       the familiar interjections.

                              RADIO�
                 Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very
                 shiny nose

                              CABBIE
                        (with heavy accent)
                 Like a light bulb!

       Fred slams his head back in his seat.

       EXT. 28TH AND LEXINGTON - CONTINUOUS

       Exiting the cab, Fred spots a young METER-MAID putting a
       ticket� on a car. The woman is pretty, but not in the
       dlassical sense. No make-up, no fuss.   She could easily
       replace the glasses with contacts ... but won't.  Fred
       watches her. A MAN exits the STARBUCKS next door sipping
       his coffee. He sees the ticket being placed on his car.

                              MAN
                 Wait! Wait! That's my car!       I was just
                 there for a minute!

                              METER-MAID
                 And?

                              MAN
                        (obviously lying)
                 Listen, my wife's pregnant and was
                 craving a frappacino.   You know how a
                 woman gets when she's pregnant, right?

       Unimpressed, the meter-maid continues writing the ticket.

                              MA
                 Ah, c'mon Sweetheart.     It's Christmas-
                 time.

                             METER-MAID
                 Well, then here's a gift.     Hope you like
                 it. It's not returnable.

       She hands him the TICKET.
                                                                   10.

                           By the way, when you're trying to talk a
                           woman out of giving you a ticket, it's
                           probably best if you didn't call her
                           'Sweetheart.'  I'm sure you don't talk
                           that way to your very pregnan_t wife who
                           you're bringing the highly caffeinated
                           frappacino�that you already drank half
                           of. Merry Christmas.

          Beaten, the man takes the ticket and leaves. Fred
          approaches the woman. He kisses her on the cheek.

                                  FRED
                     You've never been sexier, Wanda.

          Fred and Wanda embrace and begin catching up. As they
          do, they see a NYC HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE approaching. A
          HAPPY COUPLE hold each other tightly. As it passes
                                  FRED (CONT'D)
                     Those carriages are a tourist trap rip-
                     off!
                                  WANDA
                     And the horses are malnourished!

          Fred kisses Wanda on the cheek and they begin walking
          down the street together in contented silence.
                                    WANDA (CONT'D)
                     So       tomorrow's my birthday.

          Fred doesn't look up.       His response is monotone.

                                  FRED
                     Happy birthday.

          Wanda tries again.
                                  WANDA
                     And I was wondering if I should plan on,
                     you know, spending it with you. I mean,
                     we've been together for two years and --

                                  FRED
                     Wanda, you know how we feel about
                     birthdays. They're a Hallmark creation.
                     Why should we celebrate the fact that
                     you've grown a year closer to death?
                     C'mon,   Hon'.

                                  WANDA
                     No, you're right. Sorry, I don't know
                     where that came from.

                camp uncomfortable?

                        FRED
           There's my girl.

Wanda smiles weakly as Fred KISSES her cheek.                     Fred looks
at his watch, realizing ...

                        FRED (CONT'D)
           Actually, I better get to work. Gotta do
           my part to keep spreading that Christmas
           cheer.

                                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. LARGE BROWNSTONE - HOURS LATER

A VAN with lettering reading "Repo-Man(hattan) ," sits in
front of a lavish home.  The house is decorated to the
hilt in Christmas decor.

Fred EXITS the brownstone. His job is the exact opposite
of his brother's: he's a Repo Mani   Fred is carrying a
LEATHER OTTOMAN and is followed by a group of large men,
carrying other goods.  Fred grimaces at the sight of all
the Christmas decor on the fr�ont lawn.

                         WORKER
           Fred-, this flat screen wasn't even on the
           list.

                        FRED
           Otto, a twelve year old had a fifty-two
           inch plasma in her room. Trust me, we're
           teaching her a valuable life lesson.

Punctuating his thought, a SANTA STATUE HO-HO-HO'S,
scaring the crap out of Fred.


INT. FRED'S APARTMENT - LATER

We're CLOSE ON the same leather ottoman. We PULL BACK
revealing Fred.  He sits on his couch with his feet
propped up on the ottoman. The apartment is filled with
goods Fred has obviously stolen from repossessions. None
of the furniture matches - end-tables from one house, a
couch from another, a love seat even rests on it's side
in the corner - there's no room for it.
                                                                                    12 .

       at tent ion, postmarked, "North Pole." Fred� opens it.

       CLOSE-UP OF CHRISTMAS CARD

       It's from his brother, bearing a picture of Santa, Mrs.
       Claus, the Elves, and the Reindeer.  Inside is a note:

       "Dearest, Frederick.  Merry Christmas!  It's been a big
       year tor us.  Vixen gave birth to a baby reindeer!  He
       looks just like Prancer!  We didn't even know they got

       along (LOL) !

       BACK TO SCENE

       A KNOCK on the window (by the fire escape) interrupts.
       There stands a cute, if a bit mischievous, boy.  This is
       SLAM (10).  Slam is basically a black Dennis the Menace.

                                     SLAM
                     Hey Fred!      Whatcha doin'?

                                       FRED
                     Nothing.

                                       SLAM
                     Can I come hang out?

                                       FRED
                     No.

                                                                     SMASH CUT TO:


       INT. FRED'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

       Fred sits next to Slam on the couch. Slam is mid-story,
       clearly desperate for attention and love .

                                      . SLAM
                     So I'm not sure how Santa is gonna know
                     where to bring me my gifts this year
                     because I was living with my Grandma when
                     I wrote the letter, but then she got sick
                     so I was living with my cousin when I
                     sent the letter, but then she moved, so
                     now I'm living with my Aunt but a lot of
                     times we wind up staying at her
                     boyfriend's. What do you think, Fred?
                     Do you think Santa'll find me?

      Fred looks at Slam blankly for a long beat.
                                                                                                   13.

                                Let' splay the quiet game.

                 Fred FLICKS on the television. Miracle on 34th St. is
                 playing.   Fred changes the channel. A Charlie Brown
                 Christmas. He flips again. Christmas with Regis and
                 Kelly. At wits end, Fred shuts off the television. They
                 sit in silence for a while.

                                             SLAM
                                I should have gotten a�cell phone.  Then
                                I could have left Santa my cell phone
                                number and he could have called me before
                                Christmas just to see where I was.  Do
                                you think I should have done that?

                                                   FRED
                                1 think you just lost the quiet game.
                                       (a beat, then)
                                Let me tell you something about Santa
                                Claus, Kid.    Santa Cl_aus is the most
                                over-rated icon in history. Alexander
                                the Great, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson
                                Mandela, Joe Dimmagio. Heroes all.      But
                                Santa Claus? Completely over-rated. And
                                perverse I might add.    I dare you to name
                                me another public figure who is commended
                                for forcing small children to sit on his
                                lap.

                                              SLAM
                                I never thought of it that way.
                                       (then)
                                But c'mon Fred.    If you could ask Santa
                                for anything this year, what would it be?

                                                   FRED
                                Money, Kid,  I'd ask Santa for boatloads
                                of hard, unmarked, untraceable cash.
                                Then I'd take that money and buy my own
                                island. An island that's always hot and
                                where every drink comes with an umbrella
                                in it. And you know what the best part
                                of this island is? It's so far away from
                                the rest of the world that no one has
                                even heard of Santa Claus there.  I call
                                it Santaless Ville.

                 Slam takes in Fred for a beat.

                                             SLAM
                                Dude, you've got serious Santa issues
                                don't you?
                                                                      14.

      large intimidating man. This is Fred's boss, QUINCE.
      When Fred sees Quince, he quickly shuts the door, talking
      to him through a small open crack.

                              QUINCE
                 I need to send you on a job. Your phone
                 isn't working. You forget to pay the
                 bill again?

                              FRED
                 1 didn't forget to pay it. I refused.            A
                 subtle difference, but I think an
                 important one.

                              QUINCE
                 You gonna let me in?

     Fred looks around.     Stolen repossessions are everywhere.

                              FRED
                 I'm kinda busy right now, Quince ..

                              QUINCE
                 Yeah, well, I'm kinda gonna rip this door
                 off the hinges if you don't let me in.

     Fred takes a deep breath and opens the door.

                              FRED
                 Before you fly off the handle --

                              QUINCE
                        (looking around)
                 What the --

                              FRED
                 This isn't what it looks like --

     Quince GRABS Fred by the throat, and pins him against the
     wall.

                              QUINCE
                 You're stealing from me?        I'm gonna take
                 you apart.

                                VOICE   (O.S.)
                 Let him go.

     They turn.  Slam stands behind them, feigning toughness.
     He's holding A !'HONE up in the air, �like a weapon.
                                                                                          15.

            Quince and Fred turn toward Slam.

                                        FRED.
                           He knows the phone doesn't work, Kid.

                                             SLAM
                           Oh.
            Slam throws the phone away and steps toward Quince.

                                        SLAM (CONT'D)
                           I may not look like much, Big Man, but I
                           pack a punch. Brown belt, 66th Street
                           Karate Dojo. Last week, Mikey Rosenberg
                           stole my kickball during recess.  Let's

                           playing the quiet game permanently.
            After a beat taking in Slam, Quince turns back to Fred.
            He SLAMS him against the wall.
                                        QUINCE
                           I'll be sending guys over for everything
                           here.  Plus, you owe me twenty-five
                           grand. Call it interest. I want it by
                           New Years. Or you're gonna have much
                           bigger problems than a disconnected phone
                           line.

            Quince storms out.           Fred turns back toward Slam.

                                             SLAM�
                           Thank God I was here, huh?


            EXT. BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - NEXT MORNING

            Fred stands in a PHONE BOOTH, going through CLASSIFIED
            ADS. Every ad has been crossed out in red. No luck.

                                        FRED
                                  (into phone)
                           Yes, I understand you filled� the

                                  (a beat, listening)
                           Oh, it's the holiday season? Really?
                           Thanks for letting me know. That
                           explains all the lights!

--��-Yr ed l1a11gs-up-and-h:Joks-     EXT. 34TH STREET - HOURS LATER

     Spread out as far as the eye can see (spaced about twenty
     feet from one another) are identical SALVATION ARMY SANTA
     Clauss, ringing their bells and jingling their pots. We
     MOVE IN on one of them, dead in the middle.  It's Fred.
     He couldn't be more miserable. A YOUNG WOMAN passes by.

                               FRED
                         {monotone)
                  Hey Lady.  Merry Christmas.           Give to the
                  Salvation Army.

     The woman ignores him.
                                  FRED (CONT'D)
                            (under his breath)
                  Ho.

     The lady turns around.

                               WOMAN
                  What did you say?

                               FRED
                         (faking cheer)
                  Ho, ho, ho.  Merry Christmas.

     The woman raises her brow and TOSSES some change into the
     pot.  She walks away.  Fred looks over his shoulder.
     When he sees that the coast is clear, he reaches into the
     pot and POCKETS the change.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                  What are you doing, Man?

     Fred turns.        It's his NEIGHBORING SALVATION ARMY SANTA.

                                   FRED
                  What?

                               SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                  Did you just take that change from the
                  pot?

                                   FRED
                  No.

                               SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                  I saw you, Dude!
                                                           17.



              --------�REB-'------------------
             Hey Santa, I'll do things my way you do
             things yours, okay? Just mind your
             business.

The Santa begins marching toward Fred.

                          SALVATION ARMY SANTA
             The Salvation Army is my business.

ANOTHER SALVATION ARMY SANTA senses the commotion.

                          SALVATION ARMY SANTA #2
             What's going on over there?

                          SALVATION ARMY SANTA #1
             This guy's stealing from the pot.

                           SALVATION ARMY SANTA #2
             What!?   Hey Jermaine! Get over here.

Salvation Army Santa #2 starts walking toward Fred along
with JERMAINE, an extra large Salvation Army Santa.

FRED'S POV

Three Santas are converging on him, angry. Needless to
say, it's an odd sight. PEDESTRIANS begin gathering.

                          JERMAINE SANTA
             Show me your pot.

                          FRED
                    (child-like)
             I don't want to show you my pot.

The Jermaine Santa grabs Fred's pot and turns it upside
down. Nothing.
                          JERMAINE SANTA
             Empty your pockets.

                          FRED
             No.

He forcibly grabs Fred and empties his pockets.      A ton of
LOOSE CHANGE falls out.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
             I parked at a meter.

The crowd begins JEERING.     The Santas close in.
                                                                   18.

          Alright, let's just relax, fellas.
          There's kids here. There's no need to
          beat down Santa in front of --

Mid-sentence, Fred (not exactly a fighter) SLAPS Jermaine
Santa in the face and starts RUNNING AWAY. The Santas
race after him.


EXT. 34TH ST - CONTINUOUS

From OVERHEAD we watch the chase move down 34th St.,
passing even more Salvation Army Santas who HEAR THE CALL
and join the chase. A lot of strange stuff goes on in
NYC. But never has the city seen a sight this odd.


EXT. CORNER OF 34TH ST. - CONTINUOUS

A television reporter does a stand-up report.

                       REPORTER
          I'm coming to you live from 34th St.,
          made famous by the classic film, Miracle
          on 34th St. On no corner of any street
          in America is the Christmas Spirit as
          alive.

Unbeknownst to the reporter, Fred races by behind him.

                       REPORTER (CONT'D)
          Yes, standing here, you can practically
          feel the magic of Christmas. The
          shoppers, the music, the joy of --

The line of rabid, screaming Santas burst into frame,
KNOCKING DOWN the reporter and TRAMPLING him.
                                                              CUT TO:


INT. TOYS R' US SANTA AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Children and their parents wait on line to sit on the
Toys R Us Santa's lap. A timid BOY is next in line.

                       TOYS R US SANTA
          Step right up, little.boy! Ho ho ho!
          Tell Santa what you want from Christmas.

As usually happens, the little boy.bursts into tears.
                                                         19.



_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ___;,.'ATIJER------------------
          It's okay, Randy. Santa's not s.cary, you
          see?

At that moment, Fred races by (trailed by the Santas).

                       FRED
          They're gonna kill me!

                       SALVATION ARMY SANTA
          Get him!
                       SALVATION ARMY SANTA #2
          Knock him down and smother him!

Randy bursts into hysterics all over again.

ON FRED
Who runs down an aisle. He freezes. THREE SANTAS block
the exit of the aisle. He turns around. TEN SANTAS
stand there. He's trapped.
The Santas move in. Fred looks to his right and grabs a
yellow WIFFLE BALL BAT from a shelf. He lets out a WAR-
CRY and takes a swing at the first Santa. They jump on
him.  It's a giant SANTA Claus RUMBLE; Santa piles upon
Santa. Absolute chaos.
                                                   CUT TO:


INT. JAIL PHONE BOOTH - THREE HOURS LATER
Fred, beat up, stands in front of a phone. His costume
is tattered and torn from the Santa Rumble.

His attention is drawn to a HOLDING CELL to the side.    A
bunch of SCARY THUGS are eyeing him.

                       FRED
          Answer the phone, Wanda! Answer the
          phone!
                 (turning to Cop)
          What if I leave a message?

                       COP
          We put you back in the cell until she
          calls back and pays your bail.

Fred looks at the cell. In light of circumstances, this
option is especially unappealing. A THUG steps forward.
                                                               20.



--------------�~---"���HUG--�---
               Hey, Santa: I'm still waiting for that
               Tonka Truck I asked you for when I was
               nine. You holding out on me, Fatboy?

     The other thugs LAUGH.    Fred takes a deep breath.

                            COP
               You have anyone else to call?

     Clearly, Fred doesn't.    He SIGHS and picks the phone back
     up.

                             FRED
               Yes, hi Operator.    I'd like to make a
               collect call.
                      (a beat, then)
               The North Pole.    It's unlisted.

     INT. THE CLAUS BEDROOM - MEANWHILE
     SANTA Claus stands in front of a mirror, examining his
     white hair. He looks sad.

                             SANTA CLAUS
               There's not even a hint of grey in my
               hair anymore.   It's totally white.
                      (then)
               You think I should dye it?

     Mrs. Claus lies in bed.  She is reading a book entitled
     GINGERBREAD FOR DUMMIES.

                            MRS. CLAUS
               You have a nice full head of hair, Honey.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               It's white, though.  It's the stress.
               I'm going prematurely white.

     Santa plops down in bed, depressed.  Instantly, a fat
     REINDEER jumps on the bed and LAYS it's head on his foot,
     mimicking his master.

                              SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
               Cupid, down.

     CUpid doesn't move an inch.

                              SANTA CLAUS   (CONT'D)
               Good boy.
                                                      21.




                       MRS. CLAUS
          Hello. This is Mrs. Claus.
                (then, coldly)
          Yes, we'll accept the charges.

She hands the phone to Santa, unhappy.

                       MRS. CLAUS (CONT'D)
          It's your brother.

Santa sits up, excited. As the conversation takes place,
we go SPLIT-SCREEN between the two brothers.

                          SANTA CLAUS
          Fred!?

                           FRED
          Hey, Bro.      How's it going?

                      SANTA CLAUS
          Great! Oh Fred, it's so good to hear
          from you!

                       FRED
          Yeah, I meant to call and thank you for
          the Bose Stereo you sent last Christmas.
          And the golf clubs the year before while
          I'm at it. Sorry for taking so long.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Oh, I'm just glad you liked them.

                       FRED
          So, I hate to call and bother you, but I
          have no one else .to call. I'm just gonna
          come out with it: � I need some money.

Santa's face drops a bit.

                           SANTA CLAUS
          Oh.   Again?

Santa reaches into his nightstand and pulls out a plate
of his comfort food, COOKIES. Mrs. Claus immediately
takes the plate away from him and shakes her head.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          Well, of course, Fred. Whatever you
          need. How much?

Mrs. Claus motions for Santa to talk to her.
                                                                  22.



-------------------S:ANTA-�-eLAUS--(-0~-ttt-----------����
                Do you mind holding on for a second,
                Fred?

     We LOSE THE SPLIT SCREEN. Santa covers the receiver end
     of the phone with his hand.

                              MRS. CLAUS
                You should hang up, Nicholas. You have
                enough on your plate without worrying
                about him. The efficiency expert is
                corning tomorrow and look at you: you're
                already eating your stress away.

                                SANTA CLAUS
                I was hungry.

                             MRS. CLAUS
                Eating before bed is the worst thing you
                can do for your metabolism.

                             SANTA CLAUS
                He's my brother, Honey.
     Mrs .. Claus SIGHS.

                             MRS. CLAUS
                Well, just don't enable him. Every time
                he gets in trouble you bail him out. You
                need to practice tough love.

                             SANTA CLAUS
                I'm a Saint, Honey. Tough love is very
                difficult for me.

     Santa picks up the phone again.      BACK TO SPLIT SCREEN.

                             SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                How much do you need, Fred?

                             FRED
                Well, thing is ... I'm kind of in jail.

                                SANTA CLAUS
                What?

                             FRED
                Yeah, long story. So I need five grand
                for the bail and another twenty-five
                grand on top of that. For something else.

     Santa Claus shakes his head.
                                                                                                23 .

                     Mrs. Claus freezes in horror.             Fred too.

                                                FRED

                                   I know Mrs. Claus would like to see you.

                     Santa COVERS Mrs. Claus's mouth before she can scream.

                     Fred is finishing throwing clothing in a SUITCASE.                     Wanda
                     ENTERS the front door.

                                                   WANDA
                                   Hey.     Why are you packing?

                                                FRED
                                   I have to go see my brother.

                                                WANDA
                                   You have a brother?

                                                    FRED
                                   Yeah.

                                               WANDA
                                  We've been dating for almost two years.
                                  How come you never told me you had a
                                  brother?

                                                    FRED
                                   I don't know.      It never came up.
                                                                                   24.

                    Yes it did. When we first started dating
                    I said, "So Fred, do you have any
                    brothers or sisters?" And you said, "No,
                    Wanda."

                                 FRED
                    sweetie, I'm in a little bit of a rush
                    right now.
                                 WANDA
                    So you're spending the holidays with your
                    mysterious brother. Were you going to
                    tell me?
                                 FRED
                    It was last minute.

                                 WANDA
                    Where does he live?

                                       FRED
                    North.

                                       WANDA
                    Oh?     Upstate?     Maine?      Canada?

                                       FRED
                    More north.
                                 WANDA
                    You know what, Fred? You don't want to
                    invite me to meet your family, fine. You
                    don't have to be cryptic about

      At that moment, Slam BURSTS in.               He runs over to Fred.

                                       SLAM
                    Fred!     Fred!     Thank God you're home.

                                 FRED
                    Kid, it's not a good

      Slam hands Fred a crumpled TEN DOLLAR BILL.

                                       SLAM
                                               It's everything I had
                    Here's ten bucks.
                                               I need you to pretend
                    in my piggy bank.
                    to be my father.

                                 FRED
                    What on Earth are you talking about --

                                       VOICE (O.S.)
                    He's in here.
                                                          25.




                       FRED
          Who the hell are you?

                       FEMALE AGENT
          We're with child services, Sir. We've
          come to remove this minor.from an unfit
          home. Who are you?

Fred looks at Slam. The poor kid is pleading with his
eyes.  Fred shakes his head. Of all the times ...

                       FRED
          I'm the boy's father.

Awkwardly, Fred puts his arm around Slam.

ON FRED AND SLAM

We take them in: a white guy with his little black son.
It's not very convincing.  Fred realizes.
                       FRED (CONT'D}
          He has my feet.

                       MALE AGENT
          Sir, I don't know who you are, but you're
          not the boy's father.   According to our
          records, both his parents have passed
          away.

Fred looks down at Slam, surprised.

                       FRED
          You told me they were travelling around
          Europe.

                       SLAM
          Yeah, and while they vacationed in Paris
          they left me in a Brooklyn tenement with
          my unfit aunt.  I bet if you pushed you
          could have gotten it out of me.

Fred kneels down, gently.

                       FRED
          I want you to listen to me, Kid. I like
          you.  I really do.  That's a big thing
          because I don't like many people.

Slam can't help but smile.
                                                                      26.

          I know this whole thing seems kinda
          crappy and it is. And so is the� stuff
          with your parents being dead which, by
          the way, if you had told me could have
          bought you a lot more time on my couch
          and I'm proud that you didn't use
          something like that for personal gain.

                          SLAM
          Thanks.

                       FRED
          The way I see it, you found out pretty
          early that the world isn't fair. And if
          you know that this early, it gives you an
          early start on everyone else. You have
          to take care of yourself now. You know
          how to do that.

Slam nods.  Before Fred can react, Slam HUGS him.
Surprised, Fred takes a beat before awkwardly hugging him
back.  Just like that, Slam turns toward the agents.

                          SLAM
          Let's get something straight. I'm not
          Little Orphan Annie. If you're waiting
          for me to sing The Sun Will Come out
          Tomorrow on the way to the orphanage,
          you're wasting your time. Let's go.

Slam EXITS and the agents follow.  Fred watches sadly.
He realizes he still has Slam's ten dollars in his hand.

                          FRED
          Kid, wait.

Fred goes to the door, but it's too late. Fred sadly
pockets the cash. He turns back around toward Wanda.

                       WANDA
          I'm leaving you, Fred.

                       FRED
                 (not getting it)
          I'm gonna mail the kid the money back.

                       WANDA
          It was my birthday, today. And you know
          what? Maybe it is a Hallmark creation.
          And maybe I am a year closer to death.
          So I didn't need a card.  I didn't need a
          horse drawn carriage.
                          (MORE)
                                                                       27.
                                  WANDA(CONT'D)
                   But it would have been nice to have
----����-���--��-dinne;,::._w.i,th-m')Lboy.f.xciend~-I-t-couJ.d--0f'-------��� ��-��-��--�--
                   been a number two at Taco Bell. That's
                   all I required.

                              FRED
                 You get sick from Taco Bell.

    Wanda smiles, sad.

                                 WANDA
                 Goodbye Fred.

    Wanda exits.        Fred goes after her.

                                 FRED
                 Wanda, wait!

     But then Fred freezes, hearing something. Faintly, then
     a bit louder.  JINGLING.  BELLS. CLOPPING on the roof.

                              FRED (CONT'D)
                 Perfect timing. As always.

                                                                  CUT TO:


     EXT. ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER

     With his bag slung around his neck, Fred humps up the
     fire escape.  He arrives on the rooftop as we behold ...

     SANTA'S SLEIGH.

     It's much larger� than you'd expect, roughly the size of a
     mid-sized sedan. THE EIGHT REINDEER, lead by RUDOLPH,
     pace restlessly. It's quite a sight.

     An elf stands in� front of the sleigh, ultra serious.
     This is WILLY.  Like a driver at an ai)'.llort, Willy holds
     up a white sign that reads, "FRED Claus."

                              WILLY
                 You're Mr. Claus?

                                 FRED
                 Yes.

                              WILLY
                 Can I see some identification, please?

                                 FRED
                 Excuse me?

                              WILLY
                 It's protocol.
                                                                               28.

        him his license. Willy checks it out carefully.

                                 WILLY (CONT'D)
                    Very nice to meet you, Mr. Claus�.

                                     FRED
                    Fred's fine�.

                                 WILLY
                    I'm Willy. As proof of my identity as an
                    elf, I offer you my card.

      He hands Fred a card that reads: "Willy.                Head Elf."

                                 FRED
                    Well, I doubted you before, but now I
                    feel more confident.

      Willy looks at him blankly. A sense of humor is not his
      strong suit. He drags Fred's bag toward the sleigh. A
      reindeer JUMPS on Fred and starts HUMPING his leg.

                                  WILLY
                    Vixen!  Down!
                           (apologetic)
                    Sorry about that.   I think she likes you.

      Vixen hops down.        Fred SNEEZES.

                                 WILLY (CONT'D)
                    You're not allergic to reindeer are you?

                                 FRED
                    How would I know?

       Fred SNEEZES again.

                                 WILLY
                    You're allergic.

                                     FRED
                    Fantastic.
                                                                          CUT TO:


       INT. SLEIGH� CONTINUOUS

      Fred settles in the back of the sleigh.    It's much nicer
      than you'd think. Leather seats.   Fred skims the
      magazine rack in front him.  It holds various North Pole
      publications: "Santa," "Santa Weekly, 11 etc.
                                                                                29.

         from Fred by a GLASS WALL (like a limo). Though he's
         just feet from Fred, he talks through an INTERCOM.

                                   WILLY
                             (ala flight attendant)
                     A ho, ho, ho to our passengers. We here
                     in Santa's Sleigh welcome you aboard.
                     For your safety, we ask you to listen to
                     the following safety precautions. In the
                     event of a change in cabin pressure,
                     oxygen masks will drop from the roof --

        OXYGEN MASKS, shaped like Santa hats, drop from the
        ceiling. Fred SIGHS.   It's going to be a long trip.
                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


        INT. SLEIGH - TEN MINUTES LATER

        Willy is still going.         Fred is still sneezing.

                                  WILLY
                     At last check, the temperature in the
                     North Pole is a balmy negative twenty-
                     seven degrees. 7hat concludes our pre-
                     flight instructions. We know you don't
                     really have any other options when flying
                     to the North Pole, .but nevertheless,
                     we're glad you chose Santa's sleigh.
                     Enjoy the flight.

        Willy turns forward and SNAPS the reigns.

                                      WILLY (CONT'D)
                      Ho!

        And just like that the reir.deer take off. No running
        start or gradual ascent as Christmas tales would have us
        believe. Just straight up - like a rocket ship. Fred's
        head slams back. He �SCREAMS!


        EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

        The reindeer SHOOT through the sky. Fred SCREAMS the
        entire time. His CRY carries through the whole city.   Up
        and up and up, until finally hitting their altitude.
        They level off, and begin a gentle, steady ride forward.
                                                          30.




INT. SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS

Fred's head is still flush against the seat, his eyes
rolled back. He's still SCREAMING even though the ascent
has ended.  Finally Willy comes over the INTERCOM.
                          WILLY
             Ladies and Gentlemen, the seat belt sign
             has been turned off.   Please feel free to
             roam about the sleigh.

Fred, dazed, looks out the side of the sleigh.

FRED'S POV.

This isn't your typical airplane view of clouds and
skylines. They're much higher right now. It's an
overview of THE ENTIRE EARTH.  Fred takes it in, awed.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SLEIGH - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Fred SNEEZES.    Willy comes over the intercom again.
                          WILLY
             Ladies and Gentlemen, we're about to
             begin our descent to the North Pole. As
             you may have noticed, the seat belt sign
             has been turned back on.
                          FRED
             Wait, we're there, already?   Is it going
             to be as steep as --

Before he can finish, the sleigh literally drops down out
of the sky.  Fred SLAMS back into his seat and begins
SCREAMING again. Screaming and screaming and screaming
until the sleigh levels off and slows. Fred looks out.

FRED'S POV

Only about fifty feet from the ground, Fred (as well as
the audience) gets an overview of the North Pole for the
first time.  It's really quite astounding.

First off, �the colors: everything is RED, GREEN, AND
WHITE. Bright. Vivid. Like the first time you ever saw
the grass and uniforms at a professional baseball game.
                                                                               31.

            Other buildings in the village spiral out from this
            center building.     In effect, the buildings� (as a whole)
            form a giant CANDY CANE SHAPE.

           On the ground ELVES flow, elegant.          Why?    They're
           skating.
           FLOOD LIGHTS shoot up from the ground everywhere,
           lighting the whole community.

           The reindeer LAND.  Fred reaches for the door, desperate
           to get out of the sleigh.

                                      WILLY
                                                   You might want
                        I should warn you, Fred.
                                        It's quite cold in the
                        to bundle up.
                        North Pole. Oh, and also

           Fred grabs the door handle.

                                     FRED
                        Willy, I live in New York City, okay?            I
                        can handle a little cold weath

           Stepping outside the sled, Fred screams.

                                     FRED (CONT'D)
                        OMIGOD IT'S FREEZING!

           Fred SLIPS on the ice and lands flat on his butt. He
           lies on the ground, SHIVERING and SNEEZING. Reindeer
           begin HUMPING him again.  Willy approaches.

                                     WILLY
                        The ground is solid ice.   I was going to
                        warn you of that, but you stepped
                        outside, screamed, then slipped on the
                        ice.

                                      FRED
                        Yes.   Thanks for the recap, Willy.

           Willy helps Fred up.       Fred looks in front of him.

           FRED'S POV

           The entire community of� ELVES stand in front of S"anta' s
           Workshop, looking at Fred. Five female CHEERLEADER elves
           in elf/cheerleader costumes step forwa"rd.

                    Of course they are.
       Quickly, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN wearing a business suit,
       glasses, and a headset rushes over toward Fred.
                                  WOMAN
                     Mr. Claus, it's so nice to have you here.
                     I'm Charlene, Santa's Little Helper. I
                     trust your flight was quick and painless?

                     but I'm trying to keep Santa on schedule.
                     We're just one hundred, thirty seven

                     Charlene is as brilliant with numbers as
                     she is beautiful.
       Charlene is too frazzled to heed the compliment.

                     Oh, well thank you
       Charlene searches for a name.

                     started, shall we? We're running behind.
       Willy deflates a bit, but gathers himself quickly.

                     One.     And two. One, two, three, four!
       In unison, elves begin CHANTING: Here Comes Santa Claus.
                                                            33.



------------------            Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa
            Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane.

  ON THE BUILDING

  Where four elves emerge. They wear dark suits, dark.
  sunglasses, and large�earpieces. These are Santa's
  SECRET SERVICE ELVES.

                         HEAD SECRET SERVICE ELF
                   (into earpiece)
            Big Red is exiting the building.  I
            repeat, Big Red is exiting the building.

                          SANTA (O.S.)
            Ho, ho, ho!

  And like that, the elves part in the middle, creating a
  militarily precise lane. This clears a path in the
  middle of them marked "SANTA Claus LANE."

                         FRED
            You've got to be kidding me.

  Santa and Mrs. Claus step out and walk toward Fred.

                         SANTA CLAUS
            There's my big brother!

  Santa RUNS to Fred.  In his excitement, he SLIPS on the
  ice and SLIDES directly into Fred. They FALL to the
  ground in a heap. The reindeer begin HUMPING Fred again.
  The secret service elves immediately run to Santa's side.

                         SECRET SERVICE ELF
            Big Red has hit the ice.  I repeat, Big
            Red has hit the ice.

  The elves jump on Fred as if he's an assassin.   One puts
  him in a HALF NELSON.

                          FRED
            OWWWWW!

                          SANTA CLAUS
            Easy, boys.   He's my brother.

  Santa helps Fred to his t�eet.

                         SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
            You have to excuse the guys. The week
            before Christmas is obviously a very
            tense time for them.   They can't let
            anything happen to me.
                                                     34.




                       SANTA CLAUS {CONT'D)
          My goodness, it's great to see you Fred!

                       FRED
                 (muffled)
          Good to see you, too.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Say hello to Mrs. Claus!

Fred turns.   He's face to face with Mrs. Claus.

                       FRED
          How are you, Annette?

                       MRS. CLAUS
          Oh, you know, busy baking. A billion
          cookies here, ten thousand gingerbread
          houses there. And those Christmas tree
          shaped cookies may just be the death of
          me. Very intricate. But I'm not
          complaining.  I mean, what's a little
          carpal tunnel syndrome compared to the
          happiness people get from Christmas
          goodies?
Mrs. Claus leans� in and KISSES Fred on the cheek.

                       MRS. CLAUS (CONT'D)
          You look well.

                       FRED
          You too.   You've lost weight.

                       SANTA CLAUS
                 (child-like)
          What about me? Do I look like I've lost
          any weight?

Fred looks at his brother.   He's really big.

                       FRED
          It's hard to tell. You know, the suit's
          bulky and everything.

                        SANTA CLAUS
                 (holding out hope)
          Yeah, it's probably the suit.
                 (then)
          C'mon, Fred. I'll give you the tour!
                                                          35.

           Ho-Mobile.

                                                     CUT TO:


INT. THE HO-HO-HO-MOBILE - FIVE MINUTES LATER

The Ho-ho~ho-mobile is part moped, part zambonie.  Santa
sits in the driver's seat, wearing a helmet, happy as a
big red clam. Fred sits in the tiny SIDECAR, wearing his
helmet. He's freezing, sneezing, and miserable.

They arrive at a building. A sign out front reads: "The
North Pole Post Office, happily serving our community
through snow, snow, or snow."

                                                     cu:r TO:

INT. POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Fred and Santa stand in the back room.  It's an inticrate
postal system - CHUTES (shaped like water-slides) drop
mail from all over the world into LARGE BINS labeled by
continent (AFRICA_, AUSTRALIA, etc. )

                        SANTA CLAUS
          We get over nine hundred thousand letters
          a day during season. Busiest post office
          in the world.

Two elves ENTER - a married couple, LINDA AND BOB.    They
both wear postal gear, miniature mail deliverers.

                      BOB
          Linda, for God's sake, you can't just
          throw the mail from Australia into the
          Africa bin.

                       LINDA
          Don't yell at me, Bob. The Australia bin
          was getting full and I had to take
          action. I don't see what the big deal is.

                       BOB
          Oh you don't? You don't? Well maybe you
          can explain it to the kid in Kenya who
          gets a surfboard for Christmas!
                                                             36.




          Ho, ho, ho!

Linda and Bob turn.     Immediately, they shift tone.

                          LINDA AND BOB
          Santa!

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Linda and Bob, allow me to introduce my
          brother, Fred Claus.

Fred shakes their hands.

                         FRED
                  ( trying charm)
          Hey don't stop fighting on my account.
          I'm a sucker for a disgruntled postal
          worker.

Everyone FREEZES at this. Santa CLOSES HIS EYES, sensing
what's coming. Bob marches up to Fred's waist.

                       BOB
                 (pissed off)
          Are you kidding me with that?

                       FRED
                 {confused)
          With what?

                       BOB
          Don't play dumb, Wiseguy. What you were
          just doing is reaffirming a stereotype -
          the rampaging postal work. You think
          because my wife and I get a little
          stressed around the holidays and let off
          a little steam by playfully yelling at
          each other that it means we're a couple
          of nutcases biding our time until
          complete psychotic breaks? Is that what
          you think? What other stereo-type jokes
          you have? Wanna make a crack about our
          height? Know any good midget jokes?

Fred turns toward Santa.

                       FRED
          So this was fun. Where to next?
                                                        CUI' TO:

EXT. FROSTY'S TAVERN - ESTABLISHING SHOT

A small pub, next to the post office. A neon light
flickers out front. It reads, "Happy Hour, nightly.
Half off candy corn and eggnog.


INT. FROSTY'S TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

Santa and Fred walk inside.    Fred is still shivering.

                         SANTA CLAUS
            Yep, even the North Pole has a watering
            hole.

                         FRED
            Man, it's freezing in here.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
            Damn right it is!

Fred turns.  Behind the bar stands the proprietor of the
tavern: FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.

ON FROSTY

Just as we've always pictured him - three snowballs make
up his body, a carrot acts as a nose, and two lumps of
black coal for eyes. However, Frosty is not completely as
we might envision him. A CIGAR dangles from his mouth.
And he speaks with a distinct Brooklyn accent.

                         FROSTY
            Yep, I keep the place at exactly thirty-
            two degrees Fahrenheit. At this point in
            my career, there's no need to stress out
            about melting, you know?

Fred's jaw drops.

                         FROSTY (CONT'D)
            My whole life, it's l.ike I've had this
            gigantic weight on my snow-ders. Is it
            gonna be hot today? So your brother here
            calls me up and says, "Frosty, why don't
            you retire and move up North? It's
            always freezing here." It's like I've
            got a new lease on life. Life by the
            snowballs I like to say, know what I
            mean?

Fred is still staring at Frosty, his mouth agape.

                                                      CUT TO:

               The outside of the radio station has ANTENNAS shooting
               out toward the sky. The antennas are all shaped like
               candy canes.


               INT. NPlOO RADIO STATION - CONTINUOUS

               Santa and Fred stand behind a glass wall, watching a very
               hip elf, DJ DONNIE D, talk into�a microphone.

                                            DJ DONNIE D
                               Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was Jingle Bells,
                               coming in at number five this week, where
                               it's been holding rock steady for let's

                               it's still really really freakin' cold.

              DJ Donnie D notices Santa� and WAVES, excited.

                                            DJ DONNIE D (CONT'D)
                               Well, look at what the sleigh dragged in!
                               It seems we have a very special guest in
                               our studio.  It's none other than the
                               Head of the Sled, the King of Christmas
                               Bling, ho, ho, ho, it's Santa. And his
                               brother.

              Santa enters. Fred follows wearily. Santa does a cool
              HANDSHAKE with Donnie and puts on a headset.

                                            DJ DONNIE D (CONT'D)
                               Know you're busy, Santa.  You have time
                               to take a quick call?

                                                   SANTA CLAUS
                               Of course.

              Santa shrugs at Fred.                We can tell: he loves this.

                                            DJ DONNIE D
                               Tanya, line four, you're on with Santa.

                                            TANYA (O.S.)
                               Omigod! I can't believe I'm on with
                               Santa! I'm a huge fan!    You're totally
                               hot! Hey Fred, what's it's like being
                               Santa's brother? Is it just awesome?

              Donnie turns to Fred.                Fred awkwardly leans in.
                                                         39.




          Oh yes.  Awesome.
                 (to Santa)
          You know what, Bro? I'm pretty wiped.�   I
          think I need to get some sleep.

                       DJ DONNIE D
          Ladies and Gentlemen, this just in:
          Santa's brother is a party pooper, a
          frequent snoozer, an excuse user!

Donnie plays a BOOING SOUND EFFECT. Santa CHUCKLES for a
minute, then notices Fred glaring and stops instantly.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Anyways ...._I've already made your
          sleeping arrangements.   I think you'll be
          quite pleased.

INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Fred.rooms with Willy in bunk beds. Willy is on the
bottom.  Fred's feet hang off the small top bed.

                       WILLY
          You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable
          on the bottom?

                       FRED
          Don't think it'll make a difference,
          Willy.
                                                   CUT TO:


INT. SANTA'S RESIDENCE� MEANWHILE

Santa lies on his side of his bed, going through a stack
of LETTERS TO SANTA. We hear running water coming from
the bathroom.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          How you doing in there, Honey?

                       MRS. CLAUS (O.S.)
          Just finishing washing my face.

Quickly, Santa opens his nightstand, searching for his
secret stash. He pulls out a plate of ...

                        SANTA CLAUS
          What the --
                                                                           40 .



... -- .Santa:.s.-eookies-ha�""-been.-,;eplaced-by. .. a--VEGETABLE-PLATE+� -�
        celery, carrots, and dip.

                               MRS. CLAUS (O.S.)
                         (knowingly)
                  The dip is low-fat and low-carb.           I think
                  you'll like it.

                               SANTA CLAUS
                 .I want my cookies!

    Trying to rid himself of a celery stalk, Santa TOSSES it
    to a REINDEER (at the foot of his bed). The reindeer
    runs at lightning speed, catches it, and returns it
    instantly, as if playing fetch.

                               SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                  I thought you�were my boy, Blitzen.

    Mrs. Claus exits the bathroom. She's wearing a sexy (yet
    very PG rated) red nightgown. She pushes a button on the
    stereo.  MARVIN GAYE begins playing. She seductively
    walks toward the bed. Santa is still focused on the
    vegetable platter.

                              SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                 I don't understand why I can't have my
                 cookies.

                              MRS. CLAUS
                 Babe, we have to get your weight in
                 check.

                              SANTA CLAUS
                 You know how stressed out I get during
                 the holiday season.  It's these kids.
                 Used to be they'd write a letter asking
                 for a few toys. simple ones, too. A
                 doll. A yo-yo.   But look at this.

    Santa UNROLLS a letter all the way down to the floor.

                              SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                 Timmy Beckford from St. Paul, Minnesota.
                 Look at this: I-pods, video games, a
                 jersey of ... I don't even know what a
                 Lebron James is.

    Santa SIGHS and ROLLS back up Timmy Beckford's letter.

                              SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                 I'm going on a diet after New Years.
                 It's my resolution.
                                                               41.




        . --�- -- --~-------�--MRS-.--C-Ll\US- � � - - - - -
           There are other ways to relieve stress,
           you know?

Santa is searching his nightstand.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          I want my cookies.

                       MRS. CLAUS
                 (losing patience)
          Would you look at me?

Mrs. Claus stands in front of the bed, swaying gently to
the music.  Santa chomps a celery stalk, not getting it.

                           SANTA CLAUS
          What?

Mrs. Claus SIGHS and puts on a bathrobe. She PLOPS into
bed and picks up her book (He's Just Not That Into You).

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Hon'.  I'm just under a lot of
          pressure. On top of everything, that
          efficiency expert is coming tomorrow.   If
          he sends the Higher Ups a bad report, I
          really think they'll try to shut us down.
          They already want to replace my elves
          with robots and machines.

                       MRS. CLAUS
          That won't happen.

                        SANTA CLAUS
          But what if it does? What will happen to
          all my elves?

                       MRS. CLAUS
          Oh Nicholas. You carry the weight of the
          world on your shoulders, don't you?
          Here.

Mrs. Claus pulls a HEALTH BAR from her nightstand.

                           SANTA CLAUS
          What's this?

                           MRS. CLAUS
          A Zone Bar.      I'm starting you on the
          zone.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Is gingerbread on the zone?
                                                                  42.




            No.

Santa makes a face and takes a bite of the bar.           Yuck.

                                                            CUT TO:

INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NEXT MORNING

We PAN a wall, lined with FRAMED PHOTOS. The photos are
signed headshots of famous people, like one would find on
the wall of a dry cleaners.

ON HOMER'S PICTURE.  It reads, "Thanks for the fountain
pen, Santa.  I think I may begin writing about the
Greeks. Homer."

ON RICHARD NIXON'S PICTURE. It reads, "My gratitude for
the shredder, Santa. Much needed. Nixon."

ON PAMELA ANDERSON'S PICTURE.         It reads,   "Love the new
hooters,   Santa.   Thanks,   Pam."

                         SANTA CLAUS (O.S.)
            So, whad'ya think of my little workshop?

We realize our POV has been Fred's.         He turns toward his
brot.her and takes in the workshop.

ON WORKSHOP

It's absolutely bustling.       Elves work feverishly
everywhere.

AT WOODEN TABLES/BUILDING STATIONS where BUILDING ELVES,
with military precision, build toys - screwing,
hammering, and nailing.

AT CONVEYOR BELTS where MUSCLE BOUND ELVES take toys off
of the conveyor belts and pass them along the line of
other elves toward ...

TESTING STATIONS where TESTING ELVES test toys by BANGING
on them. These are like the crash-test dummy elves. An
elf takes a deep breath and hops up onto a POGO STICK.
After a few bounces, the stick falls apart, and the elf
CRASHES to the ground.

IN THE BAKERY WINDOW where Mrs. Claus, covered in flour,
frantically bakes cookies.

Fred, Santa, and Willy stand together, watching it all.
They approach a separate wall of the workshop.
                                                          43.




It's an electronic ticker tape, much like you might see
at Nasdaq.


                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          The Naughty/Nice Department. Key to the
          whole process. You'll be running it.

Fred takes in the wall. It's electronic and divided into
two separate lists: THE NICE LIST and THE NAUGHTY LIST.
Each list is divided into two columns - one for the NAME
of a child, the other for a DESCRIPTION. A nice
description reads "Eagle Scout, helps mother with
chores." A naughty one: "Bully, picks on nose-pickers."

Fred turns to the wall bordering the ticker. There are
TEN PICTURES of children, along with descriptions. The
heading of this wall reads, "TEN MOST NAUGHTY."

                       FRED
          You have a Ten Most Naughty list?

                        SANTA CLAUS
           Of course. It's constantly rotating.
           Right now, Johnny Rollins in Nova Scotia
         . is occupying the number one spot.  In the
           last month he's bitten his dentist and
           his doctor and broken skin both times.

                       FRED
          Do you know why he bit them?

                       SANTA CLAUS
          I assume they put their hands near his
          mouth. Sadly we don't have time for much
          more analysis than that. Naughty act,
          naughty kid. Keep it simple.

Fred shakes his head: there's a real sensitivity here.

                       SANTA CLAUSE
          Well, I've got a meeting. Willy will be
          able to explain everything. Oh, and
          Fred? See if you can figure out what to
          do with this Timmy Beckford kid with the
          enormous list. He's what we call an
          N&N'er - both naughty and nice. on the
          one hand, he eats all his vegetables and
          always says please. On the other hand,
          there was the unfortunate lizard
          torturing incident. Needless to say: it
          was pretty dark.
                                                                                          44.

                                  W!LLY
                     Wow. Getting final determination of
                     which children are naughty and which
                     children are nice is quite an honor.

                                   FRED
                     Highlight of my life so far.
                            (then)
                     How do you tell who's what?

     Willy walks over to a SNOWGLOBE in the center of the
     room.  It's gigantic and translucent, roughly the size of
     a Volkswagon Beetle. All across the globe, children are
     seen in action - some behaving, some not.

                                 WILLY
                    This is how we look in on children all
                    over the world and determine who's what.

                                 FRED
                    So basically, you invade their privacy
                    and based on your own subjective opinion
                    determine which kids are worthy of
                    receiving gifts, thus labeling them for
                    the rest of their li_ves.

                                  WILLY
                    In a nutshell.
                           (then)
                    Here, I'll show you.               Name a kid, any
                    kid.

                                 FRED
                    I'm not a real kid guy, Willy.
                           (then, realizing)
                    Actually, I know this one little guy in
                    NYC, Slam. Probably a nickname but ---

    Just like that

    ON SNOW GLOBE

    Slam has come up on the screen . His sits in a large
    GROUP BEDROOM in his orphanage. . All the kids are writing
    LETTERS ... except Slam.

                                 KID #1
                    What are you asking for?

                                        KID #2
                    A family.
                                                         45.



    -----------K-I-D--.#-1---
           Me too.

                        KID #3
           I'm asking Santa for a family, too.

                        SLAM
           Santa's not bringing you families.
           Let me tell you guys something. Santa
           Claus is the most over-rated icon in
           history.  Alex the Great, Abraham
           Lincoln, Nelson Man of Dela. Those are
           heroes.  But Santa Claus. Completely
           over-rated. And a perv, too. I dare you
           to name me another public figure who
           forces small children to sit on his lap.

Fred GRIMACES. Slam is repeating his earlier words.     One
of the kids steps up to Slam.

                        KID #2
           You're just saying that because you know
           you're never getting adopted. You know
           why? Because you're mean~

Slam's face drops, hurt. But then, he gathers himself
and JUMPS on the kid, starting a FIGHT.

BACK TO FRED

Upset.   He steps away from the globe.

                        WILLY
           Not good. Easiest way for a kid to get
           on the naughty list - disparage Santa.
           It's an absolute no no.  I'm embarrassed
           to say it, but at my darkest moments I
           wish more kids would be naughty. Naughty
           kids don't get presents.  Our jobs would
           be so much easier if --

                        FRED
           Of course the naughty kids don't get
           presents. That's perfect, Wiliy. The
           nice kids get everything, as always. You
           have no idea what that kid's life is
           like. He's not a bad kid, he's just been
           treated unfairly
           ... you know what, forget it. I'd like
           to just get to work.

                       WILLY
          There's the Christmas Spirit.
                                                          46.



                ----1<'RE'R--------
          Thanks, Willy.

                        WILLY
          No, really.   There's the Christmas
          Spirit.
Fred turns.  The Christmas Spirit cheerleaders stand at
the front of the workshop, cheering/caroling.

                       CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
          He knows when you've been sleeping, he
          knows when you're awake ...

The entire workshop JOINS in.   Fred GROANS.

                       FRED
          Doesn't anybody know any other songs?

                       WILLY
          Santa Claus is Coming to Town is
          definitely the crowd favorite.

The cafeteria is filled with cheer and joy. Everyone
SINGS happily. Fred is about to vomit. Suddenly, he
realizes something. He marches through the singing crowd
to a TABLE at the far end of the workshop.

The table is lined with presents.  Fred TOSSES some
aside.  Finally he sees it - the LONG LIST Santa was
looking at earlier, from Timmy Beckford in St. Paul,
Minnesota.

Meanwhile, the room is finishing the song.

                       ELF
          One more time! One more time!

Elves begins HOLDING UP lighters in the air as if at a
rock concert. Just as the room starts again, we hear a
WHISTLE.  Everyone stops and turns to the source: Fred.

                        FRED
          So listen.   If I'm gonna be stuck here
          for a bit, we're gonna have to do
          s.omething about this song.
Bob and Linda, the postal workers we met earlier, STAND.

                       LINDA
          What do you have against Santa Claus is
          Coming to Town?

                       BOB
          It's so catchy!

          It's a fantastic song. Really. But the
          thing is: all I've heard since I've been
          here is Christmas music.

DJ Donnie leans in.
                       DJ DONNIE D
          You are in�the North Pole, Man.

                       FRED
          So? You think in England they only
          listen to the Beatles? You think New
          Orleans only has Jazz? We've got to
          expand your horizons. We've got to open
          your ears to new sounds. We've got to
          stop playing that God-forsaken song over
          and over again.
Fred bends down and grabs A BOOM BOX.   This is the item
he took from the pile.
                       WILLY
          Where'd you get that?
                       FRED
          It's for that kid in St. Paul with the
          fifteen page list.
                       LINDA
          You stole a gift?
                       FRED
          The kid's getting a trampol�ine, a remote
          control car, a remote control boat, a new
          set of soccer cleats, and a Playstation.
          He's not gonna miss a fifty dollar piece
          of junk radio.

A MUSCULAR ELF stands up.
                       ELF
          Hey, I built that radio.

                        FRED
          And you did a fantastic job.  Love that
          you're still holding out hope that the
          cassette tape is gonna make a comeback.
          Don't give up on that.�
                 (then)
          Now I want you to listen to something.

Fred PUSHES play. A RHYTHMIC BEAT starts playing. It's
the hard-edged rap song, "Lose Yourself" by Eminem.
                                                            48.




Stunned silent. They don't know what to make of this.        A
pair of ELDERLY ELVES cover their ears, horrified.

                       LINDA
          It sounds ... angry.

                          BOB
          I know.
                 (then)
          I like it.

Slowly heads begin BOUNCING. Just slightly at first.
Then more. DJ Donnie D begins BEAT BOXING.  Fred smiles.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. SANTA'S RESIDENCE - MEANWHILE
Santa and Mrs. Claus sit nervously on one side of an
elegantly dressed dining table. Santa's brow is sweaty.
Why? Because opposite them sits CLYDE NORTHCUTT, the
efficiency expert.

Clyde is an overly serious-looking man - his ALL-WHITE
SUIT is immaculate. His GLASSES are black and thick.
Even his facial structure is rigid. In front of him sits
his omnipresent BLACK NOTEBOOK. This is where Clyde will
always write his findings down.

                       MRS. CLAUS
          So, Mr. Northcutt ... or would you rather
          I called you Clyde?

                          CLYDE
          No.

                       MRS. CLAUS
          Oh. Okay. Well, how was your flight?     I
          trust you enjoyed the sleigh?
                       CLYDE
          For the life of me I do not understand
          why in this day and age you wouldn't just
          use a charter plane service. The
          reindeer and sled was a noble concept
          before air travel had been invented, now
          it's simply anachronistic and unreliable.

Clyde writes again in his notebook.   Santa is panicking,
eating furiously.
                                                                        49.

                                 (to Mrs. Claus)
                        We're dead.     We're dead.

       Mrs. Claus places her hand on Santa's arm,        calming him.

                                     MRS. CLAUS
                        Are you enjoying your gingerbread?   It's
                        home-made.

                                     CLYDE
                        I despise gingerbread.

                                        MRS. CLAUS
                        Oh.   Well,   I'm sure we can

       Santa is almost gone.

                                     SANTA CLAUS
                               (whispering)
                        He hates gingerbread? All we have up
                        here is gingerbread. What's he going to
                        eat if we don't have gingerb --

      Mrs. Claus STUFFS a piece of gingerbread in Santa's
      mouth, stopping him mid-sentence.

                                      MRS. CLAUS
                        So, how long do you expect to be staying
                        with us, Mr. Northcutt?

      Clyde takes off his glasses.

                                     CLYDE
                        I'm going to be very honest with you Mr.
                        and Mrs. Claus.  I do not expect this to
                        take very long. Children are being
                        marketed to at a much younger age
                        nowadays: Winnie the Pooh on diapers,
                        Spongebob Squarepants on pajamas.    It is
                        my belief that in a day and age of
                        children who are programmed to be
                        greedier, the North Pole and your elves
                        are no longer capable of handling the
                        Christmas operation. The higher-ups are
                        already constructing a computerized
                        warehouse on the outskirts of the North
                        Pole, and upon my recommendation, will
                        shift Christmas production there,
                        outsourcing the rest. When this happens,
                        you may rest assured that Santa will get
                        a generous severance package as well as
                        an opportunity to consult on a limited
                        basis.
                                                                                     so.

             eyed, the piece of gingerbread still stuffed in his
             mouth.    Finally he removes the bread and responds.

                       Mr. Northcutt, I'm confident that when
                       you see the elves in action you'll see
                       how valuable they are.   They're hard at
                       work as we speak. Let's go visit them!

         Santa is regaining his confidence.

                                    SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                       Bring your little notebook, Clyde.
                       You're going to want to remember what you
                       see there.

                                                                               CUT TO:


         INT. WORKSHOP - TWO MINUTES LATER

         Eminem BLARES on the radio (You better lose yourself/in
         the music/the moment/You own it/You better never let it
                  l
         go ...

         The elves are huddled in a mob in the middle of the
         cafeteria, PUMPING THEIR ARMS to the music in unison.

         DJ Donnie Dis SCREAMING along with the song.

         The secret service elves are banging against one another,
         MOSHING with Fred.

         Linda and Bob are GRINDING against each other - the
         equivalent of Elf-Dirty-Dancing.

         A REINDEER (DANCER) even MOONWALKS across the floor.

         ON THE CLAUSES

         Watching, stunned.         Santa's mouth is hanging wide open.

                                         MRS. CLAUS
                       Oh Lord.

         Clyde is frantically SCRIBBLING in his notebook. It's
         Santa's ultimate nightmare. He tries to stop it.

                                         SANTA CLAUS
                       Ho, ho, ho!

        Nothing.      No one hears him over the music.
                                                          51.




           Ho, ho, ho!

Nothing.   Santa marches to the boom box and shuts it off.

                        SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
           HO, HO, HO, DOSH GARNITI ! !

Everything stops. Bob, currently mid-air (his legs
wrapped around the waist of his wife), FALLS to the
ground with a resounding THUD.

                        SECRET SERVICE ELF
           Big Red has entered the mosh pi
           cafeteria.

The elves quickly gather into place and begin CHANTING:

Awkward silence.     Clyde is scribbling away.

                                    SANTA CLAUS

                       That will be all.   Please resume your
                       work.

           Like that, the elves SCATTER. Santa peers over Clyde's
           shoulder, trying to read his notebook. Clyde COVERS it
           up, as if Santa is a kid trying to cheat on a test.

                                    CLYDE
                       You were right, Mr. Claus.  I will
                       certainly remember what I saw here.

           Before Clyde exits, he stops near Fred.
                                    CLYDE (CONT'D)

           Santa quickly pulls Fred away from Clyde.

                                    SANTA CLAUSE
                       No, no, no.  I'm very sorry but I have
                       urgent business to discuss with Fred.
                       Urgent, urgent, North Pole business.
                       Life and death stuff. It involves ...
                       stocking stuffing.

                       Oh.    Perhaps later, then.

           Clyde EXITS. Once he's gone, Santa grabs at his right
           arm, in a bit of discomfort.

                                    MRS. CLAUS

                          FRED
             No can do. Gotta get back to the naughty-
             nice department.  Those darn kids better
             be good for goodness sake, or I'm taking
             the little buggers down.

   INT. RAQUETBALL COURT - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

   Santa and Fred stand in the middle of the court.  Santa
   is wearing a red velour sweat-suit, goggles, and his
   Santa hat. Fred is miserable.

                          SANTA CLAUS
             So, Fred? About this afternoon.   It's
             important that right now the elves stay
             extremely focused.  I can't get into why,
             but it's just very important.

                          FRED
             Won't happen again.

   Fred SERVES.   The ball goes right past Santa.

                          SANTA CLAUS
             Good shot. Couldn't get to that one.
                    (a beat, then)
             I'd like to tell you why. Do you want to
             know why? No, I shouldn't say. Just
             know that I'm under a great deal of
             stress right now.

                           FRED
             Please.   Like you know stress.

  Fred SERVES again, harder.   Right past Santa, again.

                           SANTA CLAUS
             Another winner.
                    (then)
             What do you mean by that? "Like you know
             stress?" What does that mean? Are you
             under a lot of stress?

          want to overdo it right away.

          I'm not trying to win.   I just want this
          to be a nice Christmas for you.

                       FRED
          A nice Christmas? I've spent the last
          seventeen hundred years hating Christmas
          and avoiding coming here. No offense,
          but the last place I want to be for
          Christmas is here, with my family.

Santa pauses, almost looking past Fred.
                       SANTA CLAUS
          In that case, you probably shouldn't turn
          around.

Fred turns around, looking back ...

OUTSIDE THE GLASS.

Where Mother and Father Claus stand, WAVING.                        Fred's look
says it all: "you've got to be kidding me."
                                                                           CUT TO:


EXT. THE RED NOSED DINER - THAT NIGHT

A sign on the door reads,          "Closed for Santa."


INT. THE RED NOSED DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Claus family (Fred, Santa, Mrs. Claus, Mother Claus,
and Father Claus) sit at a booth.
                                                                                      55.


    Fred is squeezed in on one side next to his brother.

                               FRED
                  I can't believe you invited them.

                                      SANTA CLAUS
                  I didn't.        I accident�ally mentioned you
                  were coming, that's all.

                               FRED
                  Do you talk to her everyday?                 You're such
                  a Mama I s boy.

                                     SANTA CLAUS
                  Am not.

                                     FRED
                  Are to.

                               MOTHER CLAUS
                         (interrupting)
                  So, Fred? How have.you been?

                                     FRED
                  Fine.

                                 MOTHER CLAUS
                  That 1 s nice.
                           (to Father Claus)
                  Isn 1 t that nice, Hon'?

  Father Claus, still a man of few words,                      just NODS.

                               SANTA CLAUS
                  Fred is doing a very nice job down in the
                  Naughty-Nice workshop. The elves tell me
                  he's one of the hardest workers they've
                  ever seen.

                              MOTHER CLAUS
                 That's good, that's good.  I would think
                 he's probably a very hard worker,
                 considering ...

  She lets that hang there.  Fred looks up.                        It's not hard
  for him to be baited by this woman.

                              FRED
                 Considering what?

                                     MOTHER CLAUS
                 Nothing.

 Fred shakes his head. He .looks to his father who just
 stares back down at his food.
                                                                                 56.

                   Do you have something to say, Mother?

                                MOTHER CLAUS
                   Don't be difficult, Frederick. I just
                   think it's odd that you couldn't find it
                   in you to come to celebrate your parents'
                   anniversary. Your.brother threw such a
                   party.

                                SANTA CLAUS
                   He sent a lovely gift," though. That
                   massage chair looked very expensive.

                                MOTHER CLAUS
                   That massage chair was very expensive.
                   And it came from you, Nicholas. You
                   don't think I know my own son's
                   handwriting? You don't think I've
                   discovered that every year you get a
                   separate gift for us and forge your
                   brother's name on the card?

    Fred looks at Santa.           He didn't know that.          Santa looks
    down, embarrassed.

                                MOTHER CLAUS (CONT'D)
                   Don't be ashamed, Nicholas.  It's a
                   lovely thing you do for us. A saintly
                   thing. My little Saint Nicholas.

                               FRED
                         (under his breath)
                  Here we go.

                                MOTHER CLAUS
                   I'm sorry, Fred. What was that?

                                    FRED
                  Nothing.

    Mother Claus TSSKS and turns toward Santa.                  He looks
    saddened by the line of questioning.

                               MOTHER CLAUS
                  Sweetie, you've barely touched your food.

    Santa's plate is almost entirely empty. Mother Claus
    begins scooping some of her meal onto Santa's plate.

                              MRS. CLAUS (SANTA'S WIFE)
                  I wish you wouldn't do that, Elaine.

                               MOTHER CLAUS
                  Do what, Dear?
                                                            57.

              Force- feed him.    Nicholas needs to lose
              weight.

                              MOTHER CLAUS
              Nonsense.

                           MRS. CLAUS
              Have you not noticed how much weight he's
              gained since last time you saw him?

                              MOTHER CLAUS
              He's perfect.     He's got a lovely
              physique.

                           SANTA CLAUS
              I probably could stand to lose a few
              pounds, Mom.

                           MOTHER CLAUS
              Don't be silly. Eat, eat.

    Mother Claus redirects her attention towards Fred.

                            MOTHER CLAUS (CONT'D)
              So, Fred?   I take it you've lost another
              job?

                           FRED
              That's right, Mother.     Can't hold one
              down.

                           MOTHER CLAUS
              And that girlfriend of yours. The meter
              maid? I can't help but notice she isn't
              here.

                           FRED
              Good eye, Mother.     She broke up with me.
              Anything else?

    Mother Claus SIGHS.

                           MOTHER CLAUS
              I just wish you could be a little more
              like your brother, that's all.

    This does it.

                           FRED
              Okay, I'm out of here.
                                                                                 58.

              Unfortunately, he's stuck against the wall and Santa
              blocks his way out of the booth. GRUNTING�, he SQUEEZES
              by his portly brother and marches out of the diner.


       EXT. THE RED NOSED DINER - CONTINUOUS

       Fred STORMS out of the diner. He hits the ice and SLIPS
       on his butt. A HAND comes out of nowhere and helps him
       up. The hand belongs to Clyde Northcutt.

                                      FRED
                     Thanks.

       Once upright, Fred moves past Clyde.               Clyde catches up.

                                 CLYDE
                    Santa Claus' brother. Now that's a tough
                    beat. My brother is a doctor and I don't
                    hear the end of it. I imagine it must
                    often feel as if you don't even exist.

       This stops Fred in his tracks. Stopping his momentum
       once more causes him to SLIP. Again, Clyde helps him up.

                                 CLYDE (CONT'D)
                    I just don't know how you stay so "Santa-
                    positive." He treats you so badly.

                                 FRED
                    No, he actually means well.  I mean, here
                    I was having financial problems and he
                    flew me all the way up to help me.

                                  CLYDE
                    Please. He flew you here during his busy
                    season to remind you how well he's doing.
                    He couldn't have flown you up during
                    summer, when it's forty below zero in the
                    middle of July and everyone's bored? He
                    wanted you �to see him in action.

                                 FRED
                    Like I said, there were financial issues.
                    And he's paying me generously for my
                    work.

                                 CLYDE
                    What, a few grand? Do you even realize
                    what an enterprise Christmas is? If he
                    really wanted to help you, he could have
                    cut you in on the family business years
                    ago.  I mean, you are a Claus aren't you?
                                                         59.

          Yeah, but he doesn't care about material
          things --

                       CLYDE
          He cares about his vacation home in the
          South Pole. He cares about the private
          home theatre he and the wife are
          building. He could do a lot more for you
          than make you come work for him. You
          can't tell me the thought hasn't crossed
          your mind.

                       FRED
          Of course it's crossed my mind.  It's not
          like I've ever gotten a break in life.
          He gets them all.  It certainly feels
          like I'm overdue.

                       CLYDE
          You're a better man than I, Fred. You
          ask me: you're the saint in the family.
          You're the brother who deserves all the
          accolades and all the fame. Heck, maybe
          even all the money.

As Clyde sees Fred's wheels turning, he turns away. Once
Fred can no longer see his face, we see Clyde's
expression change. His somber face breaks into an ever
so slight, ever s9 sinister, SMILE.
                                                     CUT TO:


INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - MINUTES LATER

Fred stands in front of the snowglobe, looking at it.

ON SNOWGLOBE
A BOY sits at the dinner table with his PARENTS.

                       BOY
          Mother? Father? I've eaten all my
          broccoli as you asked. May I clear the
          table before heading upstairs to do my
          homework?

          You inay, Daniel.

   INT. NAUGHTY-NICE DEPARTMENT - EVENING (FRED'S FANTASY)

   Fred stands in front of the wall. He looks over his
   shoulder, sees that the coast is clear, and begins
   changing all of the "Nice" kids to "Naughty."
                                                          CUT TO:

   Fred secretly dumps ARMLOADS OF PRESENTS (once belonging
   to nice kids") into the vacant reindeer barn.

   EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER

   Where Fred HANDS OVER one of Daniel's toys to a STRANGER.
   The man hands Fred CASH in return.  Fred smiles.


   INT. FRED'S APARTMENT - LATER

   Where Fred hands Quince a suitcase filled with cash.
   They hug.

   EXT. EXOTIC ISLAND - WEEKS LATER

   A sign reads, "Santaless-Ville." Fred and Wanda lay on a
   private beach in gigantic lounge chairs, sipping drinks
   with LARGE UMBRELLAS in them.
                                                         BACK TO:

INT. NAUGHTY-NICE DEPARTMENT - PRESENT

Fred SNAPS out of his fantasy.  Screw it. He hits a
button on the screen, switching Daniel Tellem to the
"Naughty" list. Fred SIGHS. He clearly feels guilty.


INT. WILLY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

Fred marches into the bedroom and FLIPS on the light.

                       FRED
          Willy, wake up.

Willy JOLTS out of bed.   He's got bad bed-head.

                        WILLY
          Wha?   Huh?   What's wrong?
                       FRED
          I need a drink.

INT. FROSTY'S TAVERN - THIRTY MINUTES LATER
Fred is drunk and slightly slurring.     EMPTY GLASSES rest
on the bar in front of he and Willy.

                       FRED
          I deserve a break, Willy. I mean,
          everything is always about Nicholas.  You
          know, it is true: from the second he was
          born, it's like I ceased to exist.

Fred BANGS his glass on the bar.
                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Frosty!    Another eggnog!

Frosty approaches.
                       FROSTY
          I think you might have had enough, Son.

                        FRED
          I'll tell you when I've had enough,
          Frosty!
                  (then, to Willy)
          Ah, enough about my problems. What's
          your story, Willy? I notice you sleep
          alone in bunk beds. No girlfriend?
                                                        62.




          I'm married to my work.  Besides, I've
          never been real good with the ladies.

                       FRED
          You kidding me? Willy, you're a stud.
          You could probably get any girl in this
          whole place.

                       WILLY
          Not the one I want.

Willy CHUGS the rest of his eggnog.

                       FRED
          Who's the girl?

                       WILLY
                 (softly)
          Charlene.

                        FRED
          No kidding?   Santa's little helper?

                       WILLY
          Yep. I love her.   I love her brain.
          She's got a sexy brain.
Willy BURPS.

                       FRED
          So, what's the problem?

                       WILLY
          Well, aside from the fact that she
          doesn't know I exist, there's this little
          kicker: the.woman has almost two feet on
          me. I just had to go and fall in love
          with the one non-elf in the w.hole
          village.

                       FRED
          So, she's tall. So what?. Make the first
          move. You've got to put it out there,
          Willy. Ask her to dinner or to dance or
          something.

                       WILLY
          I can't dance.

They sit in silence for a long moment.   Fred takes a long
pull on his egg nag.
                                                            63.

   INT. FROSTY'S TAVERN - MOMENTS LATER

   Frosty the Snowman stands behind the bar, WATCHING
   something.

                          FROSTY
             This is a new one.
   ON DANCE FLOOR

   Where Willy has his arms wrapped around Fred's waist.
   They're swaying gently to the song, Lady in Red.

                          FRED
             Now you've got short arms_ That's a good
             thing. You have no choice but to get
             close.  Pull me in. Give me goosebumps.
   Willy pulls Fred close.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
             Now, look me in the eye.

                          WILLY
             I'm four foot three, Fred.

                             FRED
             Compensate.

   Willy looks up.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
             Good, good. l got goosebumps. Now
             here's the key. You want to transition
             into seduction. A lot of guys come on
             too strong, too quick. So let's showcase
             what you've got. Can you sing?.

                          WILLY
             I used to be lead caroler.

                           FRED
             Good.   Observe.

   Fred goes into performance mode, singing along. He's way
   over the top, having fun with it. Willy LAUGHS.
                                                            64.

             and then, once you've got her hooked, you

    Fred SWINGS Willy, DIPS him, and stops.   His face is just
    inches from Willy.

   Who removes his COAL EYES from his face, unable to watch.
   BACK TO FRED AND WILLY

    Inches from each other.

               Good call.
   Fred lets Willy up.

                            FRED
               Now we just have to get her down here.
               Willy, call everyone you know. We're
               throwing a Christmas_party.

   INT. FROSTY'S TAVERN - MINUTES LATER

   The entire bar is full of elves, drinking eggnog and
   chatting.  Fred sits at the bar watching Willy.

   ON WILLY

   He stands off to the side of the bar, gazing adoringly at
   Charlene.  Charlene is chatting with a circle of elves.
   Willy takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it! He MARCHES
   toward her . . . and RIGHT PAST her. He continues in a
   straight line toward the bar and sits down next to Fred.
   Fred just stares at him.

                            WILLY
                      (embarrassed)
               Wasn't feeling it.

   Fred shakes his head. Clyde approaches and sits next to
   them at the bar. He holds his ominous notebook.
                                                                           65.

                  stuff too often. Buy you an egg nag?

                                   FRED
                  No problem.

     Willy STANDS, his attention still focused on Charlene.

                                  WILLY
                  Alright.     Here we go.      I'm doing it!
     Willy MARCHES toward Charlene.           She's still dancing.

                                   WILLY (CONT'D)

                  Willy.     I'm so sorry.

                               WILLY

                  actually, I was hoping you might want --
                  the thing is, would you like to ... be

                         ( too quickly)
                  Awesome.

     Willy smiles weakly, turns, and walks back to the bar.
     He sits next to Fred and begins chugging his eggnog.
     Without looking up, Willy knows Fred's staring at him.

          Wouldn't your job be easier if you could
          answer children's letters via email?

                       BOB
          Santa believes it's important for
          children to hand-write their own letters.
          In this computerized age, it's way too
          rare for a child to actually sit down and
          write something by hand.

                       CLYDE (0.8.)
          So basically, Santa isn't moving ahead

          Oh, yeah. He's such a scatter-brain.
          That's what I'm here for.

                       CLYDE (O.S.)
          I see.  So in your opinion, it's quite

         He makes his hirings based on family
         relations, fires nobody, and refuses even
         the most basic of technological advances
         in his workplace.

Linda and Bob stare into the camera, uncomfortable.

                       LINDA
          We really just wanted to dance.

We REVEAL Clyde for the first time since the interviews
began. He closes his notebook. He looks around the bar.
In the corner, elves are FUNNELING Fred eggnog and
CHANTING.   Clyde smiles, sinisterly. He's getting
everything he wants and more.

Santa's ALARM goes off. He shuts it off before it wakes
Mrs. Claus. He kisses the back of her head and gets up.

Santa begins trying on suits from different eras.
They're all too tight: A SANTA ZOOT SUIT, A SANTA BELL-

Santa has gotten fatter.  He SIGHS.

INT. SANTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Santa brushes his teeth, he looks at himself in the
mirror. He looks at his white hair.

Santa peeks out door of the bathroom. Mrs. Claus is
still sound asleep.  Santa reaches under the sink and
pulls out a secret stash.  It's not cookies this time.
It's a bottle of HAIR DYE. Santa smiles.

The elf party after-math. Elves are sprawled all over.
An elf lies on his back, a glass resting on his chest.
A female elf has a mustache and drawn on her face.

Fred and Willy sleep on the conveyor belt, cuddling,
going round and round. Fred is wearing an elf hat.

Fred, groggy, stands up. He's still going round and
round on the conveyor belt.

          We had a little party last night, Bro.
          Things got a little wild and --

Fred's voice FADES out as he disappears from sight on the
conveyor belt.  It FADES BACK IN as he reappears.

          before I knew it, it was raining e.lves.

Santa shakes his head. He turns around. Behind him
stands Clyde, scribbling away in his notebook.

          I shouldn't have to remind you all that
          our biggest day, December 23rd, is just
          days away. All toys need to be
          completed, wrapped, and packed in the
          sleigh. This is the time of year when we
          need to be absolutely focused and

                 I'm going prematurely white.

                 not permanent.

    Nothing from Clyde.
                              SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                 I'm gonna go wash it out.

     INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS

    We watch as Fred and the elves scramble to get everything
    built in time for Christmas. Action is covered by the
    song, Twelve Days of Christmas.

    ON BUILDING ELVES

    Frenetically building toys and sending them down the
    assembly line.

    ON TESTING ELVES

    Testing the toys. An elf gently places a doll on the
    table, setting it just right. He pulls out a HAMMER and
    WACKS the doll over the head. When it doesn't fall
    apart, he gives the builders a THUMBS UP.

    ON NAUGHTY-NICE DEPARTMENT

    Santa looks over Fred's shoulder. As soon as Santa
    leaves, Fred looks at some DESCRIPTIONS on the Nice�List:

    � "Lisa Alper, star student, helps less gifted. with
                Fred changes her to "naughty."
    homework."
                                                                              71.



~---~~"MichaeLNeaver,__v.is; ts sick grandmo.t:.heL-eY..exy.....day-and--~--�- _ -��--- .... �-�--�--
                  She's not even his grandmother."             Fred
    reads to her.
     changes him to "naughty."

     - "Nicky Ernst, does chores for irresponsible brother.
                             This one really strikes a nerve.
     Doesn't tell parents."
     Fred angrily changes him to "naughty" as well.

     IN THE CLOSET

     Where Fred stuffs away more toys. The closet is
     overflowing with toys of once "nice" children.

     ON CLYDE

     Watching everything, always writing in the notebook.   We
     are left to wonder: is Clyde seeing what Fred's doing?

     ON SANTA

     Watching Clyde. We are left to wonder: is Santa seeing
     what Clyde is seeing?

     BACK TO FRED

     Standing at the snowglobe. He looks over his shoulder,
     leans in toward the snowglobe, and whispers ...

                               FRED
                  Wanda Blinkowski.

     ON SNOWGLOBE

     Which shows Wanda, in her meter-maid garb, writing a
     ticket. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN comes running out toward her.

                                   MAN
                                                    I was
                  Ah, c'mon. cut me a break here.
                  just inside for a minute, buying a gift
                  for my nephew.  I got him a fire truck.
                  He wants to be a fireman.

                               WANDA
                  Well, too bad he wasn't with you when you
                  parked in front of this fire hydrant.

     Wanda continues writing the ticket.

    ON FRED

    Who smiles, loving this.

    BACK TO SCENE

    Where the man also smiles at Wanda.
                                                      72.



                         --~'-I-------
           Fine. We'll compromise. You can give me
           the ticket. But if you do, you have to
           let me take you out to dinner.

ON FRED

Not smiling anymore.

BACK TO SCENE

Wanda is caught off-guard.

                        WANDA
           Oh, no, I, uh, I can't.

                          MAN
           You have a boyfriend?     Husband?

                          WANDA
                    (a beat, sad)
           No.

                          MAN
           You eat?

                          WANDA
           Yes, but, I'm not a dater. The whole
           concept of ritualistic dating is just an
           concept created by restaurateurs who --

ON FRED

Who mouths along with her.

                          FRED
           -- need to make sure that their
           establishments are kept full on Friday
           an.ct Saturday nights.

BACK TO SNOWGLOBE
                          MAN.
           Okay.  Then we'll have to make it lunch
           on Thursday. Deal?

Wanda hesitates.    Finally, she smiles.

                          WANDA
           Okay.

ON FRED

Stunned.
                                                           73.




           Okay!?

Fred SLAMS his hand on the globe and it shuts off.
Suddenly, a loud ALARM sounds.  Fred turns. Elves are
gathering around the "Ten Most Naughty" boa.rd. Fred
approaches and PUSHES through the mob. He finds Willy.
                        FRED (CONT'D)
           What's going on?

                       WILLY
           Big day. A new kid has taken over the
           number one most naughty spot.

ON BOARD

A picture of Slam fills the number one slot.  Fred reads
the description: "Mean to all children, constantl.y
disparaging Santa, puts himse.lf before all others, won't
eat green vegetables.  Naughty, naughty, n.aughty."

BACK TO FRED
Who turns away, unable to look.   He's about to say
something when

Santa's Secret Service Elves ATTACK Fred from out of
nowhere, flying in from all sides.   Within moments,
Fred's face has been WRAPPED and TAPED in wrapping paper,
his arms DUCT-TAPED behind his back.  Fred's SCREAMS are
muffled by the wrapping paper.

                        SECRET SERVICE ELF
                  (into headset)
           Big Red's Big Bro is secure.  I repeat,
           Big Red's Big Bro is secure.

The Secret Service Elves remove a screaming Fred from the
room. After a long beat, the other elves go back to work
as i f nothing has happened:

                                                      CUT TO:


INT. UNDISCLOSED ROOM - MINUTES LATER

The four secret service elves place a screaming (still
muffled) Fred on a CHAIR. Once he's seated, they remove
his duct-tape handcuffs; Fred immediately reaches for
the wrapping paper covering .his face and TEARS it off.

                        FRED
           WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?!
                                                          74.




FRED'S POV

His entire family sits in a line of chairs, directly in
front of him. With them sits a BESPECTACLED MAN and an
even more shocking new visitor - Wanda.

                            FRED (CONT'D)
                      (shocked)
             Wanda?

                           WANDA
                     (dazed)
             Well, it's definitely more north than
             Canada.

Fred turns to his family, searching for an explanation.

                          MOTHER CLAUS
             We're having a family intervention,
             Frederick. After the display you put on
             yesterday at dinner, we felt we had no
             choice.  Isn't that right, Father?

Father Claus SHRUGS.

                          FRED
             You had me attacked and smothered!

                          MOTHER CLAUS
             Oh, stop being difficult, Frederick.   We
             put holes in the wrapping paper so you
             could breathe. Now your brother has
             flown in someone we think can help you.

                          FRED
             Oh, is that right, �Brother?

Santa Claus looks down, embarrassed.

                            SANTA CLAUS
             She made me.

                      FRED
          And you do whatever Mommy wants you to do
          don't you?

                            SANTA CLAUS
          Do not.

                            FRED
          Do so.
                                                      75.



       --------MRS~LAU1s.------------------
         Stop it you two.

Mother Claus turns toward the BESPECTACLED MAN.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          Fred, this is Dr. Goldfarb. He's a pre-
          eminent therapist in New York City and
          he's here to help you with your problems.

                       FRED
          I don't have problems. Wanda, can you
          please tell them I don't have problems?

                       WANDA
                 (still dazed)
          I'm a little busy absorbing all of this,
          Fred. Twenty minutes ago Rudolph the Red-
          nosed Reindeer was peeing on my foot.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          I'm still not sure this is a good idea,
          Mother. We usually don't allow outsiders
          in the North Pole.

                         DR. GOLDFARB
          Mr. Claus --

                        SANTA CLAUS
                 (correcting him)
          Santa's fine.

                       DR GOLDFARB
          Oh.  Right.
                 (then, awkward)
          Santa. I'm bound by doctor-patient
          privilege to reveal nothing about this
          session. I'm pretty sure no one would
          believe me anyway.

                       SANTA CLAUS
                 (searching memory)
          Goldfarb, Goldfarb. It's funny, I don't
          remember ever delivering to you.

                       DR GOLDFARB
          I'm Jewish, Sir.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Ah. Of course. I'm good friends with
          Hanukkah Harry. Quite a chess player.
          Please pass him my regards if you see
          him.
                                                      76.




          Uh, okay.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          Mr. Goldfarb, as we spoke about on the
          phone, my son Frederick is quite unhappy.
          He's got no career to speak of, a string
          of failed relationships, and I suspect he
          blames us in some way.  I'd like you to
          fix him as quickly as possible.

                       DR. GOLDFARB
          Is this true, Fred?

                       FRED
          This is ridiculous. She's been riding me
          my entire life.
                 (re: Father Claus)
          And he never says anything.

                        DR. GOLDFARB
                 (to Father Claus)
          Is that true?

Father Claus opens his mouth to answer but --

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          He's a man of few words. My son's
          unhappiness isn't his fault and it isn't
          mine.

                        FRED
          Of course �not. Everything is my fault.

                       MRS. CLAUS
          I have to say, it does seem we often
          focus on Fred's problems and ignore those
          of my husband.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          Oh, don't be silly. Nicholas has no
          problems. He's perfect.

Mrs. Claus SIGHS and turns toward Dr. Goldfarb.

                       MRS. CLAUS
          Dr. Goldfarb, my husband is bordering on
          obese.  I worry about his health, and the
          fact that his mother is constantly
          telling him he's perfect --

                          MOTHER CLAUS
          He's shapely.
                                                                                  77.

                      (undeterred)
            That kind of thinking prevents him from
             ever taking action.

                             SANTA CLAUS
                I have been feeling sluggish lately.    And
                I can't fit into any of my old suits
                anymore.
                       (then, shyly)
                I've been looking irito gastric bypass.

                                   MOTHER CLAUS
               What!?

                            SANTA CLAUS
               It's becoming a rather standard
               procedure, Mother.  They put a staple in
               your stomach and --

                            MOTHER CLAUS
               This is nonsense! Your weight is part of
               you.  You were a large baby and you've
               grown into a large man.   Now our focus
               here should be Fred's problems.

                             FRED
               See how quickly she gets it back to me,
               Dr. Goldfarb?

Everyone turns to Dr. Goldfarb. He's clearly overwhelmed
by all of it. He TAKES A BREATH and gathers himself.

                            DR. GOLDFARB
               We'll address Santa's weight, but this
                                          I want to
               intervention is for Fred.
               start by - -

Wanda has come out of her daze.                    She looks up.

                            WANDA
                I have a question.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               Rudolph's pee will come out in the wash.
               It's just like regular pee.

Everyone turns toward Santa briefly, then returns their
attention to Wanda.

                            WANDA
                      (to Fred)
               Why didn't you tell me?
                                                                         78.

           That I'm Santa Claus's brother?               Would
           you have believed me?

                        WANDA
                  (genuine)
           If you told me? If you took me here?
           Yes, Fred.  I would have believed you.

                        DR. GOLDFARB
           I believe her, Fred. I believe that she
           would have believed you. Do you?

                              FRED
                       (softly)
           Yes.
                        DR. GOLDFARB
           So why didn't you tell her?

                              FRED
           I don't know.
                              DR. GOLDFARB
           Fred.
                               FRED
                don't know!

                              DR. GOLDFARB
           Fred.
                        FRED
           BECAUSE SHE'D NEVER LIKE ME AS MUCH AS
           SHE LIKES HIM! NOBODY DOES!

Silence.   Fred has gotten to the core of everything.

                        WANDA
           How could you think that, Fred?               Don't
           you know how much I loved you?

Fred takes this in. He seems on the verge of letting go
of his anger, his resentment. But then, he hardens

                        FRED
           Don't you have a date to get to Wanda?
           The guy with the fourteen year old nephew
           and the nice hair?

                        WANDA
           Fred, don't do this
                                                                                        79.

                          You really must have loved me, Wanda.
                          Took you a whole week to get a new
                          boyfriend. Or are you so desperate that
                          you'll just go out with anyone who asks?

              Wanda's face drops.
                                        WANDA
                            This was a mistake.         I'd like to go home,
                            now.

                                         SANTA CLAUS
                            Wanda, hold on.  I'm sure if you --

                            I'd like to go home now.

              Wanda EXITS.      Everyone is left in awkward silence.

                                         DR. GOLDFARB
                            Well, I think we've made some real
                            progress here. With time I believe

              Santa interrupts, almost talking to himself and to Fred.

                                         SANTA CLAUS
                            I never realized it before.           You hate me.

                                         FRED
                                   (exhausted)
                            I just want to be eight years old again .

                            were never born.

              Without another word, Fred EXITS.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


              EXT. REINDEER BARN - THAT NIGHT

              The wrenching song, Blue Christmas covers the action:

              In the distance, a line of HEADLIGHTS approach the North
              Pole. As the headlights shine closer they LIGHT UP a
              SHADOWY FIGURE.  It.'s Fred. He's�waiting outside the
              barn. He looks downcast, miserable.
                                                                 80.

       REPO TRUCKS! Men exit the truck - it's Otto and a few
       others, Fred's fellow Repo Men. As Blue Christmas wails
       on, Fred greets the men and leads them inside.

      MOMENTS LATER, the men exit, each carrying armloads of
      toys. The toys are loaded onto the trucks.

      OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS we watch (with Fred) as the Repo
      Men do their thing: taking possession of toys once
      destined for the "nice" children of the world.

                              FRED
                 Remember, tell Quince that after he gets
                 what I owe him, I get half of everything
                 else he sells. And keep the trucks quiet
                 until you pull away. You know how to get
                 out of here?

                              OTTO
                 Turn around, left at the Red Nosed Diner,
                 right at the Candy Cane Tower, then South
                 until we hit the real world.

                               FRED
                 That's it.

      Otto takes one last look around.

                              OTTO
                 Man, the wife is gonna freak when I tell
                 her about this. I always thought re-
                 po'ing Milli Vanilli was gonna be the
                 highlight of my career.

                               FRED
                         (half-hearted)
                 Yeah.

      They SHAKE.  The vans PULL AWAY. Fred is left there
      alone. We've seen him low before, but never this low.
      You'll be doin' alright, with your Christmas of white/
      but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.


      INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NEXT MORNING

      Everyone in the workshop is going at full tilt.    Our POV
      is Fred's, as he sadly watches everyone work.

      ON BUILDER ELVES

      Who have finished building toys, and are now transferring
      them to WRAPPING STATIONS.
                                                                     81.

           Ladies and Gentlemen, Elves and Elves,
            it's D-Day here in the North Pole.
           That's right, the eve of Christmas Eve,
           the night before the night before�
           Christmas: December 23rd. Reminder from
           Santa: all toys must be completed,
           wrapped, and piled in the Toy Room in
           order for the sleigh to be packed
           tomorrow. And now a song that's really
           shooting up the charts - it's Silent
           Night here on NPlOO.

 ON WRAPPER ELVES

 Wrapping the toys feverishly. One elf suffers a paper
 cut and SCREAMS. He's quickly pulled off the line and
 attended to by a medic.

 ON TOY ROOM

 Where wrapped toys slowly begin piling up, ready to go.
 ON MRS. CLAUS

In the bakery, rushing.  Running out of time, she pulls
out a box of ENTENMENN'S COOKIES. She debates putting
them on a round plate, passing them off as home-made.

 INT. TOY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We PAN a mountainous pile of WRAPPED GIFTS.

We PULL BACK from the toy pile.          Santa and Willy walk
around the pile.

                          SANTA CLAUS
             So what do you think, Willy?         Are we
             going to get done in time?

                             FRED {0.S.)
             We are done.

Fred stands toward the side. Santa and Fred look at each
other. After last night, things are clearly awkward.

                          SANTA CLAUS
             That can't be. We're never done a whole
             day early.

                          WILLY
             The credit belong so Fred.        He ran a very
             tight shop this year.
                                                                82 .



. -----��--�--------------~CHRJ-S'I'MAS-SP-1-RI'r---------------
                  We love Freddie, yes we do!     We love
                  Freddie, how about you?!

        The whole workshop CHEERS.  Fred's expression says it
        all: never has a man felt guiltier. Santa realizes
        something.
                                SANTA CLAUS
                  Wow.  A whole day early!?
                          (realizing)
                  Wait till I tell Clyde! There's no way
                  he'll be able to shut us
                          (catching himself)
                  -- shut us up, cause we'll be bragging so
                  much about our productivity! For his
                  thesis.
        Willy and Fred look at Santa strangely.
                               SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                  Willy, might I have a moment with my
                  brother?
        Willy nods and EXITS. The two brothers are left alone in
        silence, neither knowing how to begin. Finally ...

                               SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                  You did well here, Fred.  It was really
                  important that production run smoothly,
                  especially this year. You made it
                  happen.
                               FRED
                         (feeling guilty)
                  You don't have to thank me.
                               SANTA CLAUS
                  So ... yesterday was intense.
                                FRED
                  Definitely �intense.
        Awkward silence. Neither brother knows how to apologize.
        Santa glances up at the TOP TEN MOST NAUGHTY BOARD. Slam
        still sits at number one. Santa tries to lighten things.

                               SANTA CLAUS
                  Look at that. A new most naughty. I
                  tell you, Fred, I've never understood
                  them.  I guess they're born cruel or
                  wired wrong or something. Such a shame.
                  Is it really that difficult to be nice?

        Without realizing it, Santa has hit a nerve.
                                                                         83.

                       Unbelievable.     You just don't get it, do
                       you?

                                       SANTA CLAUS
                       Get what?
                                    FRED
                       He's not wired wrong - he's been treated
                       wrong.  I was that kid!

                                   SANTA CLAUS
                       I don't understand what you're

                                    FRED
                       You know, for a Saint you're pretty damn
                       insensitive. You're self-righteous, and
                       holier than thou, and you know what? YOU
                       HAVE GAINED WEIGHT SINCE I SAW YOU LAST!

            Fred storms away, stopping only for one last yell

                                    FRED (CONT'D)
                       AND FOR THE RECORD: YOU SHOULD WEAR
                       BLACK, NOT RED! BLACK IS SLIMMING!
            With that, Fred storms out.

                                                                     CUT TO:

            Fred STORMS away from the building, MUMBLING angrily.

            BAM! Something SMASHES into Fred's back. He turns and
            sees Santa. Santa stands there, red-faced and furious.

        FRED'S POV

        Santa (wearing his helmet) is racing after him in his HO-

        in his hand. As he passes Fred, Santa SLAMS the snow

                 Frost EXITS the tavern, coming to see what the commotion
                 is. Fred and Santa are MID-BATTLE in the speeding Ho-Ho-
                 Ho-Mobile, their eye-sight obscu�red by snow, ice, and
                 letters to Santa (as if tarred and feathered).

                 The machine is RACING toward Frosty at top speed - they
                 don't see him. And just when it looks like Frosty will
                 get plowed ...

                                 You're larger than life, Bro.
                                                          87.



        --------"ANT.A-CLAUS~----------------�-�--�����
           I swear by all things holy if you call me
           fat one more time I will catch my� breath,
           renounce my Sainthood, and beat you to
           death.

                        FRED
           I'm complimenting you, Jackass.  You're
           like this larger than life ... thing.
           You're Santa Claus. An icon. A great
           man.  I wish I wasn't jealous.  But I am.

Santa CHUCKLES, too exhausted to fight anymore.     His
chuckle evolves into hysterical LAUGHTER.

                       FRED (CONT'D)
          This is funny to you?

                       SANTA CLAUS
          It really is. You know why? Because
          I've always been jealous of you.

                         FRED
          Of me?    Yeah right.

                       SANTA CLAUS
          It's true.  I mean, for starters you've
          got this fantastic metabolism.
                       FRED
          My metabolism isn't that fantastic.
                       SANTA CLAUS
          You know what I would give to pull off a
          pair of flat front chinos like you do?
                 (a beat, then)
          And you're honest. You speak your mind,
          tell it like it is. I wish I could be
          like that. But I can't.

                       FRED
          Because you're a Saint?

                       SANTA CLAUS
          No.  Yes. I don't know.  I do it to
          myself, I guess. Always need to make
          everyone happy. To be perfect.  It' s
          like a disease. Just once, it would be
          nice to

Santa trails off.

                        FRED
          What?
                                                           88.




          To be the guy whose brother worries about
          him, instead of the guy who worries about
          his brother. And his parents. And every
          child in the world.  It's exhausting.
          I'm fat, I'm old, and I'm exhausted.

Fred looks at his brother. Santa is just lying there
staring up at the North Pole sky. He does look
exhausted, _emotionally and physically.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          I know it's selfish.  I know it's not
          "Saintly.u But just once, one time, I'd
          like to be the guy who gets the presents
          instead of the guy who gives them.  Santa
          Claus never gets a present.

Santa stands. He reaches into his jacket and pulls
something out - A PACKAGE.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D}
          Speaking of which: here.
Santa TOSSES Fred the package.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          Merry Christmas.

Santa turns and walks away. As he does, he CLUTCHES at
his right arm, in obvious disc�omfort.

                          FRED
          Bro --

Santa just keeps walking away.  Fred turns and looks at
the HUGE BODY INDENTATION Santa has left in the snow.
It's sad, touching even.  In the middle of the
indentation, lies Fred's gift.  Fred takes it in his
hands and unwraps it: It's a BIRDHOUSE: an exact replica
of the one he lost as a child.  Inside is a note that
reads: "To the Best Big Brother a guy could ask for.  I'm
sorry I cut down your tree. Nick."

Fred CLOSES his eyes and lies back in the snow.

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. NORTH POLE - LATER

Deeply shaken, Fred walks by himself, clearing his head.
He's well outside the center of the North Pole. In the
distance, he spots a BUILDING, faraway.  Fred heads
toward it, curious.
                                                                  89.


    -----��------------------------------

        INT. MYSTERIOUS BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

        Fred ENTERS, astounded at what he sees in front of him:
        it's a GIGANTIC ROOM with COTTAGE CHEESE CEILINGS. The
        room is filled with corporate-styled CUBICLES.

        A banner hangs over the room reading, "NORTH POLE, INC."

        Fred looks toward the center of the room.  Clyde is
        leading around a group of WHITE-SUITED MEN (THE HIGHER-
        UPS). They don't see Fred.

        Clyde approaches a small ROBOT. The robot sits in front
        of a small TABLE, filled with nuts and bolts.

                               CLYDE
                  This is our prototype for the robot that
                  will replace all the elves next season.
                  I guarantee they will increase
                  productivity one hundred fold.  Observe.
                         (then, commanding)
                  I-pod.

        The robot FLURRIES. Within seconds, he hands Clyde a
        completely constructed I-pod.

                                  CLYDE (CONT'D)
                  DVD Player.

        Another FLURRY.     The robot presents a DVD player.

                                  CLYDE (CONT'D)
                  Barbie.

        One final FLURRY. The robot hands over a Barbie doll.
        Just when we think the robot is done ...

                               ROBOT
                         (in robot voice)
                  Don't forget the Dreamhouse.

        The robot hands a DREAMHOUSE over ...

                                  ROBOT (CONT'D)
                  Or Ken.

       And a KEN DOLL. The higher-ups APPLAUD. Clyde notices
       Fred, excuses himself, and approaches him.

                                  FRED
                  What is this?

       Clyde looks over his shoulder.     The coast is clear.
                                                      90.




          Well, if anyone in the North Pole is
          going to be happy to hear the news, I
          suspect it will be you.
                 {smiling)
          I am an efficiency expert. I was sent
          here by the higher-ups to determine
          whether or not your brother's operation
          was still capable of handling the
          Christmas toy load. After my time here,
          I've become convinced it cannot.

                       FRED
          You're shutting him down?

                       CLYDE
          It has to be done. However, I've been
          having trouble convincing the higher-ups.
          Many of them still cling to their
          infantile worship of your brother. Even
          when I told them of his ineffective
          leadership and the slipshod work ethic of
          his elves, they wouldn't budge.
Fred breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

                       CLYDE (CONT'D)
          But when I told them about what I saw you
          doing? About how a new employee -
          Santa's brother of all people - was put
          in charge of a major department, and then
          misused his power for his own financial
          gain~ they couldn't say no.   I actually
          owe you a great deal of thanks.

                         FRED
          You used me?    No.   You can't do this.

                       CLYDE
          Don't worry. You can keep the money you
          make off the toys. It's a write-off for
          us, and the cost is well worth what we'll
          be saving in future years.
Clyde PATS Fred on the back.

                       CLYDE {CONT'D)
          Your wish has come true, Fred. I've put
          your brother out of business. Starting
          December 26th, there is no more Santa
          Claus.
                                                                                                     91.

                 The elves are PARTYING, celebrating completion of their
                 season.  Willy sioands in the front of the room, GAZING at
                 Charlene. He gathers his courage and approaches.

                                              WILLY
                                 Charlene, uh I just wanted to say: well,
                                 I wanted to say that, uh, you did a
                                 really great job this year.  It was very
                                 impressive.

                                              CHARLENE
                                 Aren't you the sweetest thing?
                                        (a beat, then)
                                 I'm so sorry, I forgot your name . . I
                                 don't know where my head is lately.

                                             WILLY
                                       (deflating)
                                Oh, that's okay.   It's Will --

                 Willy is interrupted by the NAUGHTY-NICE ALARM we heard
                 earlier (when Slam took over the Most Naughty position).
                 Instantly, a RUSH of elves separates him from Charlene.
                 Willy SIGHS and follows the crowd.

                                                                                              CUT TO:


                 INT. NAUGHTY-NICE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                The elves are gathered around the NAUGHTY-NICE BOARD.  We
                STAY' WITH WILLY as he pushes through. Up front we ...

                REVEAL FRED

                Standing in front of the board, a solemn look on his
                face. A PICTURE OF FRED has. taken over the number one
                position on the Most Naughty List.

                                             FRED
                                I have something to tell everyone.

                Fred GATHERS himself.              This won't be easy.

             For the past week, I've been secretly
             moving kids from the nice list t�o the
             naughty list.  I took all those extra
             toys and sent them to New York to be
             sold. In two hours I will be a rich man.
  Silence.   Finally, Bob steps torward.

             I knew you were no good from the second I
             met you. What kind of' person doesn't �
             like Santa Claus is Coming to Town? It's
             so catchy.

                          FRED
             There's more. That guy Clyde actually
             works for the Higher-ups. He knows what
             I did, and he's convinced his bosses to
             shut down the North Pole and fire Santa
             and all you elves. You are all going to
             be replaced by robots in two days.
  Everyone begins BUZZING, upset and frantic.

                          DJ DONNIE D
             Omigod. What are we going to do? This
             is the only thing we're qualified for.

             I'm gonna wind up being a stand-in for
             some ten year old on a crappy sitcom.  I
             just know it.

                          FRED
             We can fix this. Now understand, no one
             is going to sleep for the next twenty-
             four hours. We'll have to rebuild all
             the toys I sent out in one night.
  MURMURS from the crowd.

                          BOB
             It can't be done.

  The Christmas Spirit members start CHEERING. There's no

       We have to do this, Guys. Not for me.
       Not even for you.  We have to do�this for
       Santa. We have to do this for Santa
       because the guy has spent the past
       seventeen centuries thinking about other
       people ahead of himself. Because he's
       got a sweating problem but he still puts
       on that heavy wool red suit every day and
       never complains. We have to do this for
       Santa because I once promised him I'd be
       the best brother in the world, and I
       haven't kept that promise. I have to do
       this for Santa. WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR
       SANTA!

  A few elves NOD. More join in. Slowly, a few start
  CLAPPING. Then a few more.  The music SWELLS. Soon,
  everyone is ROUSED.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
            Good. Willy, you're in charge. Get the
            toy stations reopened. You'll need
            someone good with numbers to help.
  Fred -WINKS at Willy.

                           FRED (CONT'D)
            Charlene.     You're with Willy.

 Willy's mouth DROPS open.     He looks at Charlene, meekly.

            WE CAN DO IT, YES WE CAN. IF WE CAN'T DO

 Fred smiles, relieved.

            There's the Christmas Spirit.

 DJ Donnie PUSHES a button on a boom box. Eminem's Lose

 Where elves work feverishly, building new toys.
 ON FRED
                                                                    94 .

     AT WRAPPING STATIONS

     Where elves wrap toys. A bead of SWEAT runs down the
     face of an elf onto a package. The elf quickly wraps
     tape around his forehead, a psuedo-headband.
     BACK TO FRED

     Still by the clock.    It now reads 10:42 PM.
     AT TESTING STATIONS

     Where an exhausted elf hops on a UNICYCLE, trying it out.
     As soon as he's seated, he FALLS ASLEEP. He tips over,
     crashing to the floor. Other elves run to him.

     AT A NEW YORK CITY STARBUCKS

     Where Willy ENTERS in full elf gear, drawing stares from
     CUSTOMERS. He approaches a young BARISTA at the counter.
                             WILLY
                My company is pulling an.all-nighter.      I
                need six thousand lattes to go.
     The Barista looks at Willy, blankly.

                             WILLY (CONT'D)
                Is this gonna take lbng? My sleigh is
                double-parked.

     OUTSIDE THE WORKSHOP

     Where the elves place a final WRAPPED TOY in the sleigh.
     They're done!  Elves COLLAPSE all over the ground,
     exhausted. Willy turns to Fred and gives him an
     exhausted THUMBS UP.  Fred smiles. We END THE MONTAGE.

                                                               CUT TO:

     EXT. SANTA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

     Fred RUSHES toward Santa's door.     The Secret Service
     Elves block his path.

                             FRED
                I have to see my brother immediately.

     Nothing. They don't budge. Fred tries PUSHING through.
     The Secret Service Elves JUMP on Fred, hanging on him
     like a jungle gym. One of them gets Fred in a HEADLOCK.

                                   I am applying the noogie.     I repeat, I am
                                   applying the noogie.

                The elf starts giving Fred a NOOGIE.

                                                FRED
                              OWWWW!

                Mrs. Claus opens the door.             Fred pushes the elves off.

                                               FRED (CONT'D)
                              Annette,     I need to see him.

                                           MRS. CLAUS
                                     (grave)
                              He's not well, Fred. The doctor is
                              looking at him. Come on.

                Fred FOLLOWS Mrs. Claus inside.

                                                                                     CUT TO:

                INT . SANTA' S -'BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                Santa lies in bed. He has a thermometer in his mouth.
                Dr. Goldfarb is examining him. He looks weak. Fred
                approaches the bed.

                                                FRED
                              You okay?

                Santa REMOVES the thermometer.

                                           SANTA CLAUS
                              Nothing a few hours in bed won't cure.
                              I'll be out in the sleigh by tomorrow
                              night.

                                           DR. GOLDFARB
                              Oh, no, Santa. I'm afraid that you
                              won't.  You may have had a minor heart
                              attack.

                              Nicholas, you heard the doctor.

                                           DR. GOLDFARB
                                     (correcting)
                              Family therapist.

                      Well, you heard him. Your health is the
                      most important thing.
                              (then)
                      Dr. Goldfarb, would you excuse us for a
                      moment?

            Dr. Goldfarb NODS and EXITS.    Fred KNEELS next to his
            brother.

                                   FRED
                      Listen to me, Nick.  I know about Clyde.
                      Why didn't you say anything?

                                  � SANTA CLAUS
                      I didn't want everyone to worry.

                                     FRED
                      I know.    But I screwed up.

                                   SANTA CLAUS
                      By selling the toys?

            Fred does a DOUBLE-TAKE, shocked.

                                   FRED
                      You knew!? He wants to shut the whole
                      operation now!  If you knew, why didn't
                      you stop me?

                                     SANTA CLAUS
                      I had faith.

                                     FRED
                      In what?

                                     SANTA CLAUS
                      In you.    I had faith you'd come around.

                                    FRED
                      My God, you are a Saint.
                             (then}
                      Listen, it's gonna be okay. The elves
                      worked through the night and the sleigh
                      is ready to

                                   MRS. CLAUS
                      It's over, Fred. My husband is not
                      getting out of this bed.

            Fred looks down. Suddenly, a LIGHTBULB goes on. And
            Fred Claus does something we never expected to see him
            do: he steps up.
                                                                97.



--------------------FREfl---------------------
                Then I'll do it.

                                MRS. CLAUS
                What?

                             FRED
                Deliver the presents.         Be Santa Claus.

                             SANTA CLAUS
                You can't, Fred. It's impossible.

                             FRED
                Hey, I may not be a Saint, but I'm the
                blood relation of one.  Some of that had
                to rub off.  In a very, very subtle way.

                             SANTA CLAUS
                It could be very dangerous.  It took me
                years just to master the chimney landing.

                                FRED
                I'm doing it.

      Santa looks to Mrs. Claus.       She SHRUGS.

                             MRS. CLAUS
                I don't see any other way, Nicholas.

      Santa NODS.

                                SANTA CLAUS
                Okay.

                                FRED
                          (rousing himself)
                Okay!

      Fred heads to the door,    then STOPS.

                             FRED (CONT'D)
                Oh, if I'm going to be Santa, I do have
                one condition.

                                MRS. CLAUS
                Oy vey.

                             FRED
                This year, every kid gets a present.
                Even the naughty ones. The naughty kids
                are the ones who need the presents, Bro.

      Santa smiles and NODS.    Fred smiles back.
                                                                                            98 .

              And that's it. That's all the two brothers need to say.
              Fred EXITS.  Mrs. Claus and Santa sit there in SILENCE
              for a moment. And then      Santa POPS up out of bed.
              He's not sick at all.

                                           SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
                              Did I tell you he'd step up?

             Santa does a little JIG.

                             Ooh, Nicholas!

             Mrs .. Claus smiles and SCAMPERS into the bathroom.

                                                                                        CUT TO:


             INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - CHRISTMAS EVE

             The elves stand around, waiting.                    Many of them are asleep
             on their feet.

                                          WILLY
                             Remember everyone. He' s gonna be
                             nervous. Try and be positive.

             The DOOR opens. The elves TILT their heads,
             synchronized, trying to figure out what they're seeing.

             ELVES POV

             Fred stands there, wearing his brother's SANTA SUIT.
             He's swimming in it.

                                          FRED
                             We probably should have thought to get
                             this taken in.

             Silence.       No one seems to know what to say.
                                                             99.


           -------PFRED---(-CON'f"i7)-
           Well, this is it.  I want to thank you
           all for your hard work the past twenty-
           four hours. I'll try and make you all
           proud.

 Charlene steps forward.     She hands Fred a container of
 PEPTO-BISMOL.

                        CHARLENE
           If each child, on average, leaves one and
           a half cookies, you're looking at eating
           well over one point two billion cookies.

                        FRED
           Well, at least the suit has room.

Donnie steps forward.      He hands Fred an EMINEM C.D.

                        DJ DONNIE D
          For the ride.   I added some DJ Donnie
          beat box in the background. Takes it to
          the next level, I think.
Linda and Bob step forward.

                       LINDA
          The chimney landing takes decades to
          master.

Bob hands Fred a PILLOW.

                       BOB
          It'll ease the fall.      Strap it to your
          butt.

                       FRED
                 (touched)
          Thank you, Bob.

                       FRED (CONT'D)
          Willy, you coming?
Willy iooks up, surprised.

                        WILLY
          Me?

                       FRED
          You're my guy,  I know you're tired. I
          know the trip could be dangerous. But I
          need you.

Willy NODS. He steps through the crowd, SHAKING HANDS
and GIVING HUGS as he heads away with Fred.
                                                                        100.


         They start walking toward the door.      But suddenly, Willy
-------<>TOPs--and-TURNS-AROUNO-;------Frm:t�-10�0xs~ai::--him;��unsure--what-~---------- - - -
         he's doing.

       Willy, with purpose, MARCHES over to a work table. He
       grabs a CHAIR and DRAGS it over to Charlene. He STEPS up
       on the chair. They're face to face.

                                 WILLY
                    I'd hate to die without doing this.

       And like that, Willy (just as Fred taught him) SWINGS
       her, DIPS her, and plants a MOVIE STAR KISS on a stunned
       Charlene. He finishes the kiss, hops down off the chair,
       and walks right passed Fred.

                                WILLY (CONT'D)
                          (as he passes)
                   Bet she'll remember my name now.

       Willy, stud, EXITS.      Fred smiles and follows him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

       INT. SLEIGH - MOMENTS LATER

       Fred and Willy sit in the front of the sleigh. Fred
       grabs the reins. They're about to take off, when ...

       There's a KNOCK on the sleigh window. Fred turns.             His
       parents stand outside. Fred LOWERS the window.

                                MOTHER CLAUS
                   I don't know what you're trying to
                   accomplish here, Frederick. You've
                   already gotten your brother sick with
                   your toy embezzling scam ... must you
                   really try to --

                                 FRED
                   Ma, I'm on a pretty tight schedule here.
                   Maybe you could make me feel bad about
                   myself later?

                                MOTHER CLAUS
                   There he goes. Always being difficult.
                   For the life of me --

                                  FATHER CLAUS (O.S.)
                   Enough!

      Everyone turns toward Father Claus, stunned that he has
      dared to speak.
                                                                      101.

                     For God's sake, Elaine!  It's enough
                     already!  I can't stand around and watch
                     you behave like this anymore.

                                  FRED
                     Dad, you've been standing around watching
                     my entire life. Think you could hold off
                     for another twenty-four hours? We're
                     really in a rush.

                                     FATHER CLAUS
                     No!
                               (to his wife)
                     I want you to tell him why you treat him
                     like this.     Why you always favored
                     Nicholas.

                     Dear, you're embarrassing me in front of
                     the little elf driver.

                                  FRED
                     Dad, really. It's okay. Honestly, I'd
                     probably love Nick more than me, too. So
                     if we could just get going

                                   MOTHER CLAUS
                            ( surprised)
                     That's what you think? That I love him
                     more?

                                     FRED
                     No.     I don't know.     Can we just --

                                   MOTHER CLAUS
                     Frederick, you're my first-born. And you
                     were always ... well�, you were always like
                     me. Tough. A little rough around the
                     edges, but a survivor. Your brother was
                     like your father.    Sweet. Too sweet for
                     this world, maybe. And so fat.     I knew
                     how cruel kids could be about his weight.
                     So maybe I was more nurturing to him.
                     But that doesn't mean I loved you any
                     less. I love you very much.

         Fred looks at his mother, touched.         Willy leans in.

                                  WILLY
                     Fred, we should really be in Australia by
                     now.
                                                          102.

                 (to his parents)
          I've got to go.

Mother Claus leans in and KISSES Fred on the cheek.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          If you're not going to be back in time
          for dinner, I expect a phone call.

                       FRED
          Ma, I'm gonna be pretty busy

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          I don't think that's too much to ask.    A
          mother worries.

Mother Clauss RUBS her lipstick off his cheek.    Fred
smiles at his father and SNAPS the reins.

                       FRED
          Ho!
The reindeer SHOOT up into the sky as Fred SCREAMS. Once
Fred is airborne,  Father Claus gently places his arm
around Mother's Claus's shoulders.

                       FATHER CLAUS
          I think it's important that you finally --

                       MOTHER CLAUS
                 (interrupting)
          Oh, enough already, Herbert. You're
          starting to give me a headache.

INT. SLEIGH - ONE HOUR LATER

Willy and Fred are stopped in the SKY, well above Earth.

                       FRED
          Admit it, Willy. We're lost. We just
          passed Pluto again. We've been going in
          circles for an hour.
                       WILLY
          Santa normally navigates. I don't
          understand. We did exactly what the GPS
          said.

Willy PUSHES a button on the dash.   The GPS VOICE talks.
                                                                    103 .

                                  FRED
                     Maybe we should just stop and ask for
                     directions.

                                  WILLY
                     I don't know if that's allowed.

           INT. PARIS COFFEE SHOP - MINUTES LATER

           A CASHIER sits behind the counter, reading a magazine.
           Suddenly, he hears a CRASH on his roof. He looks up,
           shakes his head, then returns to his magazine.

           Moments later, the door DINGS, signaling the arrival of a
           customer. The cashier looks up and finds Fred (in full
           Santa gear.), and Willy ( in full elf gear) .

                                  WILLY
                     Bonjour. Uh, my French isn't really so
                         could you tell us which way Australia
                     is?

                                  FRED
                     And could I use your bathroom real quick?
                     It's gonna be killer getting this suit
                     off once we get rolling.

           Off the cashier's confused look we ...

           EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

           Fred and Willy stand next to the chimney. Fred's ar.ms
           are filled with GIFTS. One gift is really large.

                                  WILLY
                     Okay, your first house.    You all set?

                            FRED
          Damn.    Sorry.

                       WILLY
          Don't apologize.   Santa never has to
          apologize.

Fred GATHERS HIMSELF and JUMPS down the chimney.

INT. CHIMNEY - CONTINUOUS

Fred is hanging from the surfboard which is wedged
sideways in the chimney.

                       FRED
          Okay, not a good start.

Now, we watch as Fred delivers gifts all over the world.
AT A FIREPLACE

Where Fred lands (on his pillow-padded butt) and LOOKS
UP. On a couch opposite him sits a family of stunned
HASIDIC JEWS.

                       FRED (CONT'D)
                 (calling up)
          Willy! Wrong house again!

                         WILLY (O.S.)
                   (calling back)
          Sorry!

                       FRED
                 (to family, explaining)
          It's my first day. Shabbat Shalom.
Fred heads back up the chimney.

AT ANOTHER FIREPLACE
                                                                                 105.

                          Timmy Beckford, St. Paul, Minnesota?

             Timmy NODS.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)
                          So we finally meet. You probably don't
                          realize this, but you've been a big
                          conversation point in the North Pole.

             Timmy is still staring, mouth AGAPE.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)
                          Here's the thing, Timmy. You asked for
                          an awful lot this year. And that lizard
                          torture thing didn't help your case. But
                          I know you're a good kid.  I hear you
                          spent all the money you made at your
                          lemonade stand on a Mother's Day gift.
                          So I'm hooking you up, okay?

             Timmy NODS.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)
                          The trampoline's out, though.  I can't
                          get that thing through the chimney.

             Timmy NODS again. He approaches Fred and hands him a
             GIANT PLATE of cookies.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)
                          Alright, fine.  You can have the
                          trampoline but you have to pretend I
                          never saw these cookies.

             They SHAKE on it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                         It doesn't matter what he does, Mr.
                         Claus.  In two days, I'll have shut the
                         North Pole down.

             Clyde stands behind Santa. Santa doesn't turn around.
             Clyde walks away triumphantly.

               Clyde Northcutt. 422 Dashwood Drive,
               Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

     Clyde STOPS in his tracks.    Santa turns toward him.

                            SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
               You made the most naughty list in '84.
               Very naughty year. You kept fighting
               with other kids. Twelve fights in all if
               I remember correctly.  You asked me for a
               Superman cape.

                            CLYDE
               You can't possibly remember that.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               I remember more than you'd think.   I
               remember that I didn't send you the
               Superman cape.

                            CLYDE
               No, you didn't.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               You were very naughty that year.
                      (a beat, then)
               Did you always wear glasses, Clyde?

                            CLYDE
               I don't see what that has to do with

                               SANTA CLAUS
               Your glasses.     Did you always wear them?

                             CLYDE
                       (defensive)
               Yes.   I was cross-eyed as a child.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               Four-Eye Clyde. Isn't that what they
               called you?�

     Clyde's head instinctively lowers, instantly vulnerable.

                            SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
               And is it possible that after a while of
               being called Four-Eye Clyde, you got
               angry? Maybe even started a fight or
               two? Maybe twelve?

                            CLYDE
               It's possible.
                                                       107.




          So you asked for something.     A Superman
          cape, maybe?

                       CLYDE
          Clark Kent wore glasses.      But when he
          turned into Superman ...

                       SANTA CLAUS
          He didn't need the glasses anymore.

Clyde looks down, embarrassed.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          It was wrong of me not to send you the
          gift.  I fear I had an incorrect
          understanding of naughty children.

                       CLYDE
          If you think an apology will prevent me
          from shutting you down, you're mistaken.

                          SANTA CLAUS
          I know.

Santa REACHES down.     He hands Clyde a GIFT.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)
          This is a little late.

Clyde OPENS it: it's A SUPERMAN CAPE.

                       SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D}
          You want to put it on?

                       CLYDE
          I'm a thirty-five year old man, Mr.
          Claus.  I'm not putting on a --

                       SANTA CLAUS
          Just put it on.

                           CLYDE
                    (quickly}
          Okay.

Trying to hide his excitement, Clyde dons the cape.

                          SANTA CLAUS
          Glasses off.

Clyde takes off his glasses.
                                                               108.

                I was a fat little kid. Kids called me
                Thick Nick ... So what do you tliink? You
                think I could have a hug? Just a
                friendly display of affection between
                Thick Nick and Four-Eyed Clyde?
                              CLYDE
               No.

                            SANTA CLAUS
               Just a quick little hug?

                            CLYDE
               It doesn't seem appropriate in light of
               the --
                            SANTA CLAUS
               Fly to me, Superman.

     Instantly, Clyde puts his arms out in front of him and
     (ala Superman) FLIES to Santa. They hug. Clyde begins
     CRYING in Santa's chest.
                            CLYDE
               I'm finally Superman.
                              SANTA CLAUS
               Yes you are.

                            CLYDE
                      (through tears)
               I also asked for a GI Joe Action Figure
               set that year.

               Let's not press our luck, Clyde.

               Santa?   You found me.
                                                                  109.

                  Of course I found you. I find all the
                  good kids. Your gifts are over by the
                  door.

        Over by the door is a GIGANTIC PILE of gifts.    Slam's
        eyes WIDEN.
                               FRED (CONT'D)
                  I might have gone a little overboard.
                         (a beat, then)
                  You need to start behaving again, Slam.
                  I know you've had some crappy breaks, but
                  that doesn't mean the world's a crappy
                  place. The world is what you make of it.
                  We need kids like you to make it a nice
                  place.  Kapeesh?

                                SLAM

                               FRED
                  Now, back to sleep.

                                SLAM
                  Okay.  I promise I'll be good from now
                  on, Santa.

        Fred smiles and turns to go.    Suddenly, he realizes:

                               FRED
                  I'm gonna need my wallet back, Slam.

        Slam's ARM pops up.   He holds Fred's wallet.

                               FRED (CONT'D)
                  We'll pretend that didn't happen.

        And just like that, Slam's back asleep. Fred COVERS him
        with the blanket, smiles, and walks out.

      INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LATER

      Wanda sits at a table with her DATE - the man who asked
      her out previously when she gave him a ticket.

                                WANDA'S DATE
                   So basically I work for Smith Barney down
                   on Wall Street. I didn't originally want
                   to be an investment banker but ...

      He trails off.      Wanda looks lost in thought.

                                WANDA'S DATE (CONT'D)
                   Is everything okay, Wanda?
                                FRED (O.S.)
                   No, everything' s not okay. �

      Wanda looks up. Fred stands at the table. His Santa
      suit is attracting stares from the restaurant patrons.

                                FRED (CONT'D)
                   Everything's not okay because she should
                   be having.dinner with me. She loves me.
                          (a beat, then)
                   And I love her.
      Wanda looks up, shocked.

                                WANDA
                   What did you just say?

      Fred; still not comfortable expressing feeling, STOPS a
      passing waiter.

                                FRED
                   I'm gonna need a Double Egg Nog, please.
                   Rocks.

                   Um, we don't have eggnog, Sir.

                                FRED
                   What kind of dump is this?
                          (to Wanda)
                   Yeah, I said I love you.

                               WANDA
                  I love you, too.

       Wanda STANDS and KISSES Fred.

                               WANDA' S DATE
                  Are you serious right now? You're
                  leaving me for a guy in a Santa costume?

                               FRED
                  It would have happened eventually.   She'd
                  never fall for an investment banker.
                  Investment banking is a concept created
                  by high-end Universities so that parents
                  who spend hundreds of thousands on
                  college educations can feel validated
                  when their kids get a six figure job
                  straight out of college.

                                WANDA
                  He's right.

       We FOLLOW Fred and Wanda as they walk away.

                                NARRATOR (O.S.)
                  So, Fre.d managed to save the day AND get
                  the girl. And since he interrupted
                  Wanda's dinner, he even managed to end
                  the night with a quick bite to eat.

                of Fred's story ends right here.  In a
                small little orphanage in New York City
                that he'd been visiting for months.

      Fred BURSTS into the room.

                            FRED
                Kid! Kid! Thank God you're here.
                Listen we don't have a lot of time!

                             SLAM

                I need you to pretend to be my kid.
                Here's ten bucks. It's everything I had
                in my piggy bank.

      Fred HANDS Slam back the ten dollar bill.   Slam looks at
      it, confused. Slowly, he looks back up.

            me cause I swear I'll trade you in for a
            cuter kid -- oh God, he's going mushy.

 Slam is HUGGING Fred.     After a beat, Slam pulls back.

            Let's get one thing straight: I'm not

 As Fred and Wanda LAUGH with Slam we PULL BACK.     And
 BACK.  And BACK. Until ...

 BLACK SUIT AND HAT) , Mrs. Claus, and both the Claus
