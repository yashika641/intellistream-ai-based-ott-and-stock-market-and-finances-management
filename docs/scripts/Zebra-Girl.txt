                         ZEBRA GIRL





1   EXT. CATHERINE AND DAN'S COUNTRYSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

    An old grand house sits isolated in an idyllic rural
    setting. Fruit trees, shrubs and scented plants sway in
    the wind. A patio decked with wicker chairs stares out at
    the horizon.

    A low rumble of thunder in the distance underscores the
    NATURAL OUTDOOR SOUNDTRACK OF NOCTURNAL ANIMALS.

    A dim glow flickers in the TOP ATTIC WINDOW.

    Below it, curta ins flutter in a wide open window on the
    third floor.

    The NOCTURNAL SOUNDS carry into --

2   INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

    -- A moonlit bedroom decorated in modest tones with PINK
    ACCENTS.

    CATHERINE (32) preppy in pink flannel pyjamas, sits wide-
    eyed under the duvet in her bed staring at the ceiling.
    The comfort of heavy layers protects her from the world.
    She shivers.

    Next to her, lies her husband DAN ( 37), sound asleep on top
    of the duvet with his back to her. Well built and
    handsome, he sleeps in boxer shorts.

    Oddly, the room is cold for Catherine and hot for Dan.
    Catherine's breath is visible and Dan sweats profusely.
    Catherine turns to Dan and looks at her husband as though
    she's forgotten why she ever married him. Like he's an
    imposter.

    O.S. UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES spoken in a backwards language
    creep into the bedroom.

    The VOICES hit her from all sides.
    Catherine's eyes dart around.

    The VOICES grow in both volume and occupants.
    A terror rises within her.

    She turns to Dan and shakes him.

                            CATHERINE
               Dan.   Dan wake up.

    Nothing.   She shakes him harder.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Dan!
    Dan is dead asleep.
                                                              2.
    The VOICES louder now.
                                         (CONT'D)
                             CATHERINE
               DAN!

    Catherine turns away from Dan and tugs on the chain of a
    bedside lamp. It won't turn on.

    Catherine frantically tries again.     Nothing.

    FULL PANIC ATTACK.

    She turns back to Dan.

    Her eyes widen in shock and fear.

    The VOICES CRESCENDO and explode into --

    SILENCE.

    Dan is no longer beside Catherine, the comforter oddly
    peeled back on his side of the bed.

    Catherine stares at the empty space.

    She turns to check the ENSUITE BATHROOM.

    The bathroom door is open.     The light is off.   Dan is not
    there.

    She turns away from the bathroom and looks around the room
    in paranoia.

    She tugs on the lamp chain again. It turns on. She tugs
    the chain again. The lamp turns off. She repeats this a
    few times.

    She turns to look at Dan's empty side of the bed.
    The wheels in her head turn.

    She touches the empty space.

    A mixture of fear and disappointment etch her face.
    Reluctantly, she slips out of bed --

3   INT. HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

    Catherine nervously ascends the dark staircase.
    Her hand braces the banister.

    O.S. a loud floor CREAK.
    Catherine stops.
    Nothing.
    She continues cautiously.
    The wooden steps randomly creak as she tip-toes upwards.
                                                             3.
4   INT. HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY/DAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

    Catherine stops on the moonlit landing.

    She notices a dim fluorescence creeping out from under a
    closed door.

    Filled with dread, Catherine approaches it then stops
    short.

    On the wall beside her hangs an ANTIQUE OIL PAINTING OF MEN
    FISHING.

    She stands before it with a deep sense of foreboding.
    She steps forward and with trembling hands, quietly lifts
    it o ff the wall.

    There's a hole in the wall the size of Catherine's face.
    Within that hole, there's a smaller hole so she can spy
    into the room.

    Catherine stares into the hole.
    Fear, dread and disgust engulf her.
    She looks away, alarmed by what she sees.
    Deep breaths, then --
    She forces herself to look back through the hole.
    Rage consumes Catherine and a primal urge overtakes her.
5   INT. HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGH T
    Enraged, Catherine descends the stairs with a firm grip on
    the banister.
6   INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
    The kitchen is dark and empty.
    A large wooden table sits in the middle adorned with unlit
    candles. A PINK TEA POT sits on the stove. Plants in PINK
    VASES nestle on windowsills.
    Catherine rushes in and makes straight for the cutlery
    drawer.
    She yanks it open.
    Cutlery clanks about as she rummages t hrough the drawer.
    The UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES return in a cacophony of
    explosive sound around her.
    She turns sharply to address them.
                            CATHERINE
              Zip it.
                                                               4.
     The voices cease on a dime.
                                         (CONT'D)
                             CATHERINE
               Thank you.
7    INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     Dan, in pyjama bottoms and a loose robe, sits at his desk
     in the dark.
     With his back to the door and headphones on, he's oblivious
     as he types on his laptop. His body obscures the screen.
     He types and scrolls with an odd intensity.
     The laptop glow illuminates his face and a sense of danger
     behind his eyes.
     He wipes swe at from his brow.
8    INT. HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY/OFFICE DOOR - NIGHT
     Catherine's hand carefully turns the doorknob and --
9    INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     The door creeps open.
     Catherine slowly approaches Dan from behind, practically
     floating like a ghost.
     As she gets closer, the light from the laptop illuminates
     her wild eyes.
     Dan catches Catherine's reflection on his screen.
     He rips off his headphones a nd spins around --
                           DAN
               Catherine it's not what you...
     Catherine lets out an almighty, FERAL SCREAM.
     She whips out her hidden arm, raises it and slams down a
     PINK HANDLED BUTCHERS'S KNIFE right into Dan's right
     temporal lobe.
     A lightening flash illumantes her silhouette as her SCREAM
     reverbs eerily throughout the house and into the night --
                                                       CUT TO BLACK:
10   EXT. HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY - 1 YEAR AGO
     A GARDEN SP ADE slams deep into soil.    Dirt flies onto a two
     foot soil pile.
     Catherine, dressed in gardening gear, wipes sweat from her
     brow.
                           DAN
               This one's a beaut.
                                                              5.
     Dan comes up from behind her carrying an expensive GERTRUDE
     JEKYLL bush.
     He places it beside the freshly dug hole and picks
     Catherine up.
     She squeals in delight.
                           CATHERINE
               It's a Juliet Rose --
     Dan oozes charm and lovingly recites an Emily Dickinson
     poem.
                           DAN
               "I hide myself within my flower,
               That wearing on your breast, You,
               unsuspecting, wear me too. And
               angels know the rest."
     Catherine kisses him long and deep.
     Madly in love, Dan carries her through the garden and up
     into the house.
11   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT - PRESENT
     The pitter patter of rain hits the small attic window.
     Catherine, covered in blood, stands up in frustration.
                            CATHERINE
                   (to Dan)
               Should have locked the door.
     Dan now has a BLOODIED PINK TOWEL wrapped around his head,
     tied tight at the point where the PINK BUTCHER'S KNIFE
     protrudes fr om his temple.
     She bends down out of sight again.
     Dan's legs are hoisted into the air as she attempts to push
     Dan into the office closet.
     She struggles, shoves and pushes from all sides until --
     FINALLY! --
     The body goes in.
     She slams the door and leans against it.
     Breathing heavily, she looks down at her blood stained
     clothes.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Bastard.
     Catherine pushes off the door and leaves.
     The closet door slowly creaks open.
     NOCTURNAL SOUNDS fill the silence and morph into --
                                                              6.
12   EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
     The SOUND OF MORNING BIRD SONG as the sun rises behind the
     house.
13   INT. HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING
     Catherine's bloody pink pyjamas slosh around in soapy
     water.
     The LOW HUM of the washing machine calming and hypnotic.
     Two legs hang down in front of the machine, sporting jeans
     and white Converse All Stars. The legs kick back and forth
     like a child on a swing.
     Catherine sits on top of the machine in a PINK SWEATER,
     engrossed in Bronte's 'JANE EYRE' as she munches on a
     swedish caramel wafer. Her nails freshly painted over old,
     chipped varnish.
     An old doorbell chimes.
     GONG!
     Catherine looks up.    She knows exactly who it is.
     It chimes again.
     GONG!!
     Catherine takes a PINK BOOKMARK, sets it on her page,
     closes the book and hops off the washing machine.
14   INT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - M ORNING
     Catherine opens the front door.
     ANITA (32) stands smoking a cigarette out of a short
     cigarette holder. Sporting a RED LEATHER JACKET and
     AVIATOR SUNGLASSES she's larger than life, yet true to
     life. She has a working class toughness that masks an
     achingly sentimental heart.
     Happy and relieved to see Anita, Catherine gives her a big
     smile.
                             CATHERINE
               Anita!
                            ANITA
               There you are. Almost forgot
               w hatcha looked like.
                             CATHERINE
               Huggers.
     Catherine goes to hug Anita.
     Anita ignores her and walks past her, straight into the
     house.
     Catherine is taken aback.
                                                         7.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Well -- That was rude.
                      ANITA
          Smoke inside?
                      CATHERINE
          Of course not.
Catherine grabs Anita's cigarette and throws it outside.
Catherine looks out the door in all directions to see if
Anita was seen. Nobody. They're safe.
Catherine slams the front door shut.
Anita circles the large entrance, impressed by the home.
                      ANITA
          This your home?
Catherine nods her head.
                      CATHERINE
          My husband --
                         ANITA
          Husband?
Ani ta grabs Catherine's hand and examines her WEDDING
RING.
                                 (CONT'D)
                         ANITA
          That real?
                         CATHERINE
          Yes.
                      ANITA
          Mother of fuck.
                      CATHERINE
          He's well off. Well his family
          was. He's a lecturer.
                         ANITA
          Adorable.     How long?
                         CATHERINE
          Three years.     Five years together.
                        ANITA
          No.    I mean how long you been out?
                         CATHERINE
          Five years.
                      ANITA
          Jumped right into it didn't you?
          Kids?
Catherine shifts awkwardly.
                                                        8.
Anita grabs a framed picture of Catherine and Dan from a
side table that's littered with photos of them in various
outdoor activities. Cycling down a country lane. Trekking
on a hilltop. Fishing off the river bank.
She picks up one of Catherine and Dan taking a selfie
surrounded by a champagne picnic.
Anita's not impressed.
                         ANITA (CONT'D)
          Adorable.
Catherine grabs the photo and sets it back in it's place.
                      CATHERINE
          We like to do -- outdoorsy stuff
          okay --
                      ANITA
          That sounds retarded.       You tell
          him about me?
                         CATHERINE
          Of course.
                         ANITA
          Liar.
                      CATHERINE
          On our first date I did.
                      ANITA
          What'd he say?
                      CATHERINE
          He was -- understanding.
                        ANITA
          Hmmm.    His name is Dan?
                         CATHERINE
          Yes.
                         ANITA
          Dan the man?
                         CATHERINE
          Just Dan.
                        ANITA
          Just Dan.    Adorable.
                      CATHERINE
          Why are you being aggressive,
          darling?
                         ANITA
          Darling?
                         CATHERINE
          Why --
                                                              9.
                           ANITA
               Because you never call!
     Catherine slowly approaches her.
                           CATHERINE
               The phone works two ways darling.
     Inches apart, the sexual tension is palpable.   It seems as
     if Catherine's about to kiss her then --
                           ANITA
               Suppose you're right.
     Catherine smiles.
                           CATHERINE
               Tea?
                           ANITA
               With Scotch in it.
                           CATHERINE
               Lovely!
15   INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
     Catherine and Anita sit across from each other at the
     kitchen table.
     They drink tea out of FANCY PINK TEA CUPS. Catherine sips
     hers with two fingers gently pinching the small handle.
     Anita holds her cup tight with her whole hand.
     A BOTTLE OF EXPENSIVE SCOTCH sits on the table next to
     Anita.
     Catherine smiles warmly at Anita.   Basking in their
     reunion.
     Anita sulks and pours Scotch into her tea.
                           CATHERINE
               Dan says that's a good one.
                           ANITA
               It's all the same once it's in
               your gut.
                           CATHERINE
               Now, now, darling. Don't sulk. I
               should have called. I really
               should have. So very sorry. The
               important thing is that we're here
               now, isn't it?
                           ANITA
               Suppose.
     Catherine wraps her hand around Anita's.
                           CATHERINE
               Don't suppose. Know.
                                                       10.
                      ANITA
          Yeah - I know.
                       CATHERINE
          Good.
                      ANITA
          So what is it, Catherine?
                      CATHERINE
          What is what?
                      ANITA
          Why'd you call me?
                       CATHERINE
          Oh.   Of course.
Catherine pulls away and takes a deep breath before taking
a sip of her tea.
She sets the tea cup down gently and crosses her hands on
the table.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I caught Dan -- watching -- it --
          again.
                       ANITA
          What's IT?
Catherine takes a deep breath before taking another sip o f
tea.
She sets the tea cup down and crosses her hands on the
table again.
She stammers.
                      CATHERINE
          Po -- porn -- pornogr --
Catherine kicks out her chair, stands and paces.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          He promised me he'd stopped. He
          even went to counselling. But
          what good is working on your
          illegally libidinous shortcomings
          if you're not making a lifetime
          commitment to destroying them?
Catherine throws herself back int o her chair.   She sips her
tea and attempts to calm down.
Anita watches and waits.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          It was the middle of the night.
          His office door was closed. I saw
          that glow under the door. So I
          went and looked through my
          peephole.
                                               11.
                        ANITA
          Peephole.
                      CATHERINE
          He was on his laptop.
                      ANITA
          And that means? --
                     CATHERINE
          Duh! Of course! Door closed.
          Laptop on. Three in the morning?
                      ANITA
          But how do you --
                      CATHERINE
          Because I know!
Anita is at a complete loss.
                     CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Well. Go ahead. Judge away,
          Anita. Judge away.
                      ANITA
          So what the fuck happened?
                      CATHERINE
          What do you mean "what happened"?
          Do I have to spell it out for you?
          I caught him w atching it again so
          I stabbed him in the side of the
          head. Right in the right temporal
          lobe.
Anita's eyes widen in horror.
                        ANITA
          WHAAAT?
She can't believe this.
                        ANITA (CONT'D)
          Is he DEAD?
Catherine's eerily proud and calm.
                       CATHERINE
          Yes.   I'd imagine he is.
Anita freaks.
                      ANITA
          You ain't sure?
                      CATHERINE
          Well if he's not at the moment, I
          can't imagine he'll last much
          longer.
                      ANITA
          The bloody hell is he!?
                                                             12.
                            CATHERINE
               Upstairs.   In the closet.
                           ANITA
                   (gallows humour)
               Like you?
                           CATHERINE
               No. Not like me. I am not "in
               the closet". He's literally -- in
               the closet.
16   INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
     The closet door opens.
     Anita stands behind Catherine as she looks inside.
     Anita inches up behind Catherine, peeks at DAN'S CORPSE and
     does a 360 degree jump-spin.
                           ANITA
               Fuckin' Bambino Jesus Christo!
     Anita paces behind Catherine.
     Catherine stands still.    Proud of herself.   A small smirk
     on her face.
                           ANITA (CONT'D)
               That's a dead man!
                           CATHERINE
               Appears so, doesn't it?
                           ANITA
               You gave him the death sentence!
                              CATHERINE
               Affirmative.
     Anita tries to catch her breath.
                           ANITA
               No -- I mean -- shit -- I mean --
     Anita's jumping suddenly turns into a very bad MOONWALK.
                           CATHERINE
               What are you doing?
                           ANITA
               Gotta do the MJ. The MJ gets my
               mind right.
     Catherine laughs.
                           CATHERINE
               Would you like a cigarette?
                           ANITA
               That'll be fun.
                                                          13.
     Anita continues to MOONWALK.
     Catherine slams the closet door shut.
17   EXT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY
     Catherine and Anita, both in SUNGLASSES, lounge on wicker
     lawn chairs. Anita smokes. Catherine pours more whisky
     into Anita's cup, sits back and calmly sips her tea.
                           CATHERINE
               I need you to go into town.   Buy a
               bow saw.
                             ANITA
               A bow saw?
                           CATHERINE
               In pink if you can find it.
                             ANITA
               Hell.
                           CATHERINE
               We have to dis member him.
                             ANITA
               Shit.
                           CATHERINE
               Dismember and burn him.
                             ANITA
               Fuck.
                           CATHERINE
               Then hose the place down.
               Speaking of -- after you go to the
               "pink bow saw" store, I need you
               to go to a different store and buy
               some cleaning supplies. Bin bags,
               bleach, sponges --
     Anita takes a deep drag.
                           ANITA
               Bow saw at one store --
                           CATHERINE
               Cleaning supplies at the other.
                           ANITA
               To avoid suspicion.
                             CATHERINE
               Obviously.
                             ANITA
               Obvio usly.
     Catherine sips her tea. Anita sips her whisky tea and
     takes another long drag.
                                                           14.
                                      (CONT'D)
                           ANITA
               You coming with?
                              CATHERINE
               Can't.     I'm known in town.
                              ANITA
               Of course.
                              CATHERINE
               Of course.
     Catherine sips her tea.     Anita smokes.
                           ANITA
               But nobody knows me.
                              CATHERINE
               Correct.
                              ANITA
               Correct.
     Catherine sips her tea.     Anita smokes.
                           ANITA (CONT'D)
               That's why you called me? I'm
               your 'undercover scummer'?
     Agitated, Catherine sits up and clocks A SPIDER crawling
     near her chair.
     She lifts her foot and stomps on it.
                                                   CU T TO BLACK:
18   EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON - 1993
     It's windy and overcast.
     A rusty pair of RED SWINGS, a rusty RED SLIDE, and a
     dilapidated RED SEESAW sit on top of gravel with dead grass
     growing through it. A few dilapidated park benches sit to
     the side.
     The playground is empty except for CATHERINE, AGED 7, who
     sits alone on a bench.
     Tufts of cotton stick out of her war-torn FLUFFY PINK
     JACKET that s its on top of a school uniform, her legs
     covered in thick leggings and black winter boots. A PINK
     STOCKING CAP sits on her head. Oversized, black-rimmed
     glasses sit firmly on her nose. Her hair in BRAIDED PIG-
     TAILS.
     Catherine gently rocks herself to stay warm as she reads
     'PYGMALION' by BERNARD SHAW with a PINK BOOKMARK between
     the pages.
     Wind blows through trees.
     O.S. the SCHOOL BELL RINGS.
     Cather ine looks up from her book.
                                                     15.
She stares in all directions at the closed school doors.
The calm before the storm.
She looks back down at her book.
WHOOSH!   SLAM!
The school doors open and a rush of CHILDREN spill out.
They charge past Catherine, oblivious to her reading on the
bench.
Catherine spies over the top of her book and watches a FEW
KIDS being hugged and snuggled by their PARENTS. Some are
given treats.
                       YOUNG CATHERINE
               (to self)
           Babies.
Catherine goes back to reading.
O.S. a SUCKING NOISE, then --
                       YOUNG ANITA
           Whatcha readin'?
Catherine jumps out of her seat.
As if by magic, ANITA, AGED 7, appears next to Catherine on
the bench. She wears blue jeans, WHITE CONVERSE ALL STARS
and a RED JACKET. Her hair sprinkled with fake strands of
BRIGHT RED HAIR. She looks like a rocked out My Little
Pony.
She sucks on a RED LOLLYPOP and often talks with it in her
mouth, the juice running down her chin.
                       YOUNG ANITA (CONT'D)
           Sorry to scare you.
Catherine looks over both her shoulders.
                       YOUNG ANITA (CONT'D)
           Saw you sitting alone and wanted
           ta say hello. So -- "Hello!"
Anita waves her lollypop.
Catherine eyes her suspiciously.
                       YOUNG ANITA (CONT'D)
           My name's Anita. What's yours?
Catherine takes a deep breath.
                        YOUNG CATHERINE
           Catherine.
                       YOUNG ANITA
           You like books?
                                                      16.
Catherine nods.
                                      (CONT'D)
                      YOUNG ANITA
          What's your favourite?
                      YOUNG CATHERINE
          'REMEMBERENCE OF THINGS PAST'.
          Yours?
                      YOUNG ANITA
          'GOOSEBUMPS'.
                      YOUNG CATHERINE
          That's a children's book.
Catherine looks at Anita square on.
                      YOUNG CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I don't read children's books. I
          read books that will impress
          someone someday.
                      YOUNG ANITA
          Why?
                       YOUNG CATHERINE
          'Cause when you impress someone
          you can get them to carry your
          luggage wh en you go on journeys -
          Sigmund Freud.
Anita stares at Catherine, who avoids her stare.
Awkward silence as Anita continues to stare at Catherine.
Catherine slowly turns her head back to Anita.
Upon eye contact Anita's face lights up in a smile.
Catherine quickly turns away and attempts to read her book
and avoid Anita.
Another awkward silence.
                      YOUNG CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Trying to start a staring match?
                      YOUNG ANITA
          Y ep!
Catherine slams her book shut.
                      YOUNG CATHERINE
          Well I won't have it.
Catherine turns to Anita and stares back at her.
They actually ARE having a stare off.
                      YOUNG ANITA
          Gotcha.
                                                              17.
                            YOUNG CATHERINE
               Got what?   I didn't blink.
                           YOUNG ANITA
               Gotcha into having a stare off!
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               You're right.
     Catherine blinks.
                              YOUNG ANITA
               You blinked!     I win!
     Anita laughs.
     Catherine punches her book in frustration.
                                            (CONT'D)
                            YOUNG ANITA
               Oh!   There's my friend!
     Anita waves at a BIG BLURRY FIGURE in the distance.
     Catherine follows her gaze.     Jealousy engulfs her.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Good. Go away. I don't need yo u
               lingering over my clavicles.
     Anita calls out to her friend.
                           YOUNG ANITA
               Come on over!
                   (to Catherine)
               Don't be shy. You'll love her.
     Filled with jealousy, Catherine's eyes dart from Anita to
     the BLURRY BLOB in the distance. She squints hard to focus
     --
                                                       CUT TO BLACK:
19   INT. HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - DUSK - BACK TO
     PRESENT
     Catherine struggles with Dan's dead weight as she drags his
     body by the fe et along the top landing.
     The BLOODIED PINK TOWEL wrapped around his head has dried
     in places.
     She looks down the staircase with irritation.
                              CATHERINE
               Shit.
     Dan's head bounces down the first few steps.
     This won't work.
     She turns him around, hooks her arms underneath his and
     drags him down the stairs behind her.
                                                              18.
     O.S a loud RIIIIP.
     Catherine jerks back on herself.
     Dan's PJ BOTTOMS are caught on a protruding nail.
                              CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                   (to Dan)
               Oh dear.
     She drops Dan's torso and detaches his boxers from the
     nail.
     Once detached, she stands up with determination.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Okay.   Let's go.
20   INT. HOUSE - LOWER HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - DUSK
     O.S. heavy breathing.
     Dan's legs drag along the landing.
     Catherine stops dead in front of TWO ADJAC ENT BEDROOM
     DOORS.
     One door is open and leads to their bedroom.   The door
     adjacent to it is CLOSED.
     She drops his torso to catch her breath.
     She looks up at the CLOSED DOOR.
     An odd mix of emotions cross her face that end in resigned
     determination.
     Lost in thought, a SHADOW slowly creeps up behind
     Catherine.
     As it LOOMS LARGE --
21   EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON - BACK TO 1993
     A HUMAN-SIZED STUFFED TEDDY BEAR towers over Catherine (7)
     and Anita (7) but they surprisingly keep their cool.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Hello.
                   (to Anita)
               What's her name?
     TEDDY answers and speaks only in a 'Charlie Brown
     GIBBERISH'.
                              TEDDY BEAR
               [Gibberish.]
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               One Hundred and Thirteen? Ha!
               Were your parents crazy?
                                                             19.
                              TEDDY BEAR
               [Gibberish.]
                              YOUNG CATHERINE
               No.     I just met her.
                              TEDDY BEAR
               [Gibberish.]
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               I just MET her.
                              TEDDY BEAR
               [Gibberish.]
     Catherine slams her book against her head in frustration.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Are you trying to cause me grief?
                              TEDDY BEAR
               [Gibberish.]
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               GRIEF! It's a word for when
               someone causes you pain.
     Catherine looks at Anita and back to TEDDY.     She doesn't
     get it.
     Catherine takes a deep breath and gets ready to explain the
     meaning of the word "grief". Then --
                           YOUNG ANITA
                   (to TEDDY)
               Like when a bloke rubs the back of
               your neck and smiles through the
               moustache. If you pee your pants
               when that happens - that's grief.
     Catherine looks at Anita, impressed.
                           YOUNG ANITA (CONT'D)
               'Bout right, don't cha think?
     Catherine slowly nods in agreement.
     TEDDY VANISHES.
     Sadness washes over Anita.
     Cat herine cautiously reaches out to hug her.
     Anita recoils - then suddenly smiles.
                           YOUNG ANITA (CONT'D)
               Wanna swing on swings?
22   EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
     Catherine and Anita swing on swings.
                                                  20.
                       YOUNG CATHERINE
           So -- you don't like to be
           touched?
                        YOUNG ANITA
           Nope.
                        YOUNG CATHERINE
           Why?
                       YOUNG ANITA
           Just don't like it.
Silent swinging.
Catherine changes the subject.
                       YOUNG CATHERINE
           I'm in the class for supremely
           precocious children. Although
           there's this one boy who drools,
           but apparently he's brilliant.
                       YOUNG ANITA
           You're in a retard kids class,
           ain't you?
                       YOUNG CATHERINE
           No! It's a SMART kids class. W e
           get special attention for being
           superior.
Anita's feet slam down on the gravel.
Catherine's feet slowly do the same.
Both pairs of feet in perfect alignment.
Silence.
                       YOUNG ANITA
           My Daddy causes me grief.
           Sometimes he plays the "Itsy Bitsy
           Spider" game up my leg.
Catherine is mortified and extremely concerned.
                        YOUNG CATHERINE
           He does?
Anita nods, cheeks red with shame.
                       YOUNG ANITA
           You believe me?
                        YOUNG CATH ERINE
           I do.   I absolutely do.
Catherine thinks hard for a second.    Then --
                       YOUNG CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           If those things are happening, my
           parents will take you in. I'll
           force them to.
                                                              21.
     Anita jumps off her swing and throws down her lollypop.
     She paces and bites her fingernails.
     Catherine jumps off her swing and mirrors Anita's pacing.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Anita -- you need to stay
               somewhere else.
                           YOUNG ANITA
               How do you know?
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Because I read books on therapy!
     Anita stops.   Catherine stops.   They look at each other.
                           YOUNG ANITA
               Can I sleep in your bed?
     Catherine claps and jumps up and down, full of excitement.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Of course! You see? This is a
               multiple person's victory!
     Catherine extends her hand. Anita takes it, leans in and
     gently kisses Catherine on the cheek.
                           ANITA
               You sure are pretty.
     As Anita stares lovingly at Catherine, a large SHADOW grows
     over them.
     It starts at their feet and slowly grows over their small
     bodies, eventually blocking out all daylight --
23   I NT. HOUSE - LOWER HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - DUSK - BACK TO
     PRESENT
     Catherine notices the LARGE SHADOW growing behind her and
     turns.
     Anita stands on the staircase holding several shopping
     bags. That same sulky look plastered on her face.
     She looks down at Dan's body.
                           ANITA
               Fuck, it's like 'Welcome to Dead
               House' in here.
     Catherine grabs the bags of supplies from her.
                           CATHERINE
               Tick-tock, Darling.
     Catherine make s her way through the bedroom and into the
     ensuite bathroom.
     Anita reluctantly follows, stepping gingerly over Dan's
     body.
                                                          22.
24   INT. BEDROOM/ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT
     A needle settles unto an OLD RECORD PLAYER.
     The sultry tones of Dusty Springfield's "SPOOKY" float into
     the bedroom.
     Anita turns away from the player and slinks her way towards
     the large ensuite bathroom, stopping at the door.
     A claw-footed porcelain tub sits in the middle of the
     carefully decorated, oversized bathroom with TASTEFUL PINK
     ACCENTS.
     Catherine kneels on the floor and rummages through shopping
     bags, pulling out Anita's best buys and examining each one.
     First the bleach.
                             CATHERINE
               Lovely.
     She pulls out TWO PAIRS of utility gloves.
                                         (CONT'D)
                             CATHERINE
               Fab.
     Four LARGE PINK SPONGES.   One at a time.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Good thinking, Anita. We'll
               obviously need more than --
     A LOUD THUMP pierces through the MUSIC, followed by what
     sounds like a CHANDELIER landing on carpet.
     Anita looks up at the sound in fear.
     Catherine darts her head towards Anita.
                                         (CONT'D)
                             CATHERINE
               You hear --
     Anita nods.
                                         (CONT'D)
                           CATHERINE
                   (whispering)
               Anyone follow you?
     Anita oddly shrugs one shoulder.
                                         (CONT'D)
                           CATHERINE
               What is that?
                           ANITA
                   (whispering)
               What?
                             CATHERINE
               That.
     Catherine mimics Anita shrugging one shoulder.
                                                          23.
     Anita shrugs her shoulder again at Catherine shrugging her
     shoulder.
     A LOUD house creak.
     Anita freaks.
                              ANITA
               Fuuuuuck.     Dan's back from the
               dead!
                           CATHERINE
                   (still whispering)
               Pull yourself together!
     Catherine quietly rummages in the shopping bags and pulls
     out a PINK BOW SAW.
                                          (CONT'D)
                              CATHERINE
               Pink!
     Anita smiles, pleased with herself.
     Catherine stands and attempts to take the safety-slide off
     the bow saw's blade.
     She struggles and hops around on one foot trying to get the
     safety off.
                              CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Good lord!
                              ANITA
               Need help?
                           CATHERINE
               For the love of --
                   (it comes off)
               GOT IT!
     She throws the safety in frustration.
     Catherine puts a firm grip on the bow saw and makes her way
     to the hallway, leaving Anita cowering behind.
25   INT. HOUSE - LOWER HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - NIGHT
     Catherine approaches the landing slowly but confidently.
     The SONG is finished.
     Anita's nowhere in sight.
     SILENCE as Catherine tip toes towards the landing.
     Her eyes grow in disbelief as she looks up to --
     DAN.
     No longer dead on the landing, but standing in a suit and
     loose tie, clutching his briefcase and a PINK SHOPPING BAG.
                                                          24.
                           DAN
               Hey there Sweetheart.   Nice bow
               saw.
     She shakes her head.   This can't be real.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               Sorry I'm late. I had to make a
               little detour.
     He holds up the shopping bag and makes for the ADJACENT
     CLOSED DOOR.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               I think you'll love it.
     Catherine softens as she watches Dan grasp the door handle
     and walk into the dark room, out of sight.
     Shaken, she edges to the bannister and looks up and down
     the staircase i n all directions.
     Nothing seems amiss.
     Catherine turns to face the door Dan walked through, now
     ajar.
     She approaches it, terrified of what lurks behind.
     With a deep breath, she musters courage and steps into the
     darkness that explodes into A BRIGHT SILVER FLASH --
26   EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY - 3 MONTHS AGO
     -- Of a FISHING LINE as it catches the sun and plonks into
     the sparkling river. An imposing Castle lo oms on the
     horizon.
     Catherine, in waders and a pink checked shirt, walks
     towards Dan, into her fully decked out fishing chair and
     places her rod carefully on the rest. HORTICULTUE AND BIRD
     WATCHING MAGAZINES stacked neatly on the hamper.
     Dan sits beside her in an identical set up reading the
     latest academic publication of 'ENGLISH: THE JOURNAL OF THE
     ENGLISH ASSOCIATION'.
     Dan leans over and tops up his steaming thermos cup with
     EXPENSIVE WHISKY.
                            DAN
               Nice cast.
     Catherine smiles, pleased with herself. She absently rubs
     the inside of her palm.
                           CATHERINE
               I learned from the best.
     Dan watches her carefully. He gently pries her hand into
     his, kisses it and continues to caress it as he settles
     back into his journal.
                                                          25.
     Catherine sips tea from her thermos cup and watches the
     water like a Hawk.
27   INT. HOUSE - ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT
     Catherine, oddly calm, returns to a pacing Anita.
     She fills a glass of cold water and stares at herself in
     the vanity mirror as she gulps it down. From the corner, A
     LONG LEGGED SPIDER crawls it's way towards her reflection.
                              ANITA
               What was it?
     Catherine snaps to and gra bs the shopping bags.
                              CATHERINE
               Nothing.
     She dumps the contents on the floor.
                              ANITA
               Was it Dan?     Dan the man?
     Catherine ignores her.
     Thick black tape, surgical masks, bin bags, disinfectant
     etc all spill onto the floor.
                                      (CONT'D)
                           ANITA
               What's wrong --
                              CATHERINE
               Nothing!
     Catherine stares at the supplies and picks up a pack of
     plastic dust sheets.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               You are surprisingly good at this
               Anita.
28   INT. HOUSE - ENSUITE B ATHROOM - NIGHT - LATER
     The upbeat jazzy notes of 'L-O-V-E' by NAT KING COLE waft
     into the room.
     Most of the bathroom is covered in plastic sheets.
     Catherine stands on a step ladder and tears off black tape
     with her teeth.
                           CATHERINE
               You ever get over your fear of
               being touched?
     Anita sits on the floor juggling tape balls.
                           ANITA
               Not the back of the neck.
                                                     26.
                      CATHERINE
          Your girlfriends -- they respect
          your boundaries?
Catherine sticks plastic to the walls.
                      ANITA
          The last one didn't. She'd get
          drunk and grab my neck.
                      CATHERINE
          And she knew you can't be touched
          there?
Anita nods in shame.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          And she did it regardless?
Anita nods again.
Catherine jumps down and inspects the cleaning products.
She grabs the BOW SAW.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Now that you're back I won't let
          anyone harm you. Just like the
          old days.
Catherine stares at the bow saw, lost in thought.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          That's why you called me, right?
                         ANITA
          Called you?
                      CATHERINE
          You want me to off her?
                         ANITA
          Off who?
                      CATHERINE
          Your ex-girlfriend.
                         ANITA
          Catherine --
                         CATHERINE
          What?
                      ANITA
          You called me.
Catherine looks at Anita stunned.
                         CATHERINE
          What?
                      ANITA
          You called me up.
                                                      27.
                      CATHERINE
          Are you demented?   You called me
          up.
                      ANITA
          You called me 'cause you needed me
          to help you with --
Catherine clenches the bow saw.
                      CATHERINE
          I was in a happy marriage! I
          Didn't need you coming here and
          ruining it all for me!
Catherine's crazed eyes bore into Anita, the BOW SAW now
dangerously close to Anita's neck.
Anita's terrified.
Catherine calms on a dime and smiles.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Deeply sorry, da rling. Don't know
          what came over me.
She puts the bow saw down.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Dan's suits are in the wardrobe.
          Line the bathtub with them.
She turns away to inspect the cleaning supplies.
                         ANITA
          Catherine --
                         CATHERINE
          Yes?
                      ANITA
          Catherine -- maybe you should call
          the police.
Catherine stops, her back to Anita.
                      ANITA (CONT'D)
          Call the police Catherine.
Catherine's face morphs into an eerie gargoyle-like
manifestation.
                      CATH ERINE
          I'm not going to do that.
                      ANITA
          You need help.
                      CATHERINE
          I'm not calling the police!   Are
          you fucking crazy?
                      ANITA
          Crime of passion --
                                                             28.
                           CATHERINE
               'Crime of passion' my arse! --
               Call the police --
     Catherine grabs the roll of bin bags and turns to Anita.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               You are funny Anita. Now help me
               bag this bastard up.
                                                     CUT TO BLACK:
29   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     The same JAZZY TUNE is being played by a FEMALE PIANO
     PLAYER.
     CHRISTMAS DECOR dresses the upscale, crowded restaurant.
     Merry customers dine and laugh.
     CATHERINE (27) sit s alone at a table and wears a
     conservative black dress. Her hair is long and flowing.
     Catherine seems calm and radiates honesty and
     vulnerability.
     She attempts to smile at the strangers around her and
     contemplates the 'normal life' of others.
     As stable as Catherine seems, she feels out of place.
     Awkward. Not completely adjusted to social situations.
                            She pats down her face and wipes her
     She fixes her hair.
     brow.
     A carafe of water sits on the table with two wine glasses.
     Menus sit on the plates.
     Catherine recognises a MAN approaching her table.
                             CATHERINE
               Dan?
     DAN (32) arrives at the table and pulls out his chair.
     He's confident. Wears a suit and tie and comes across very
     professional.
                             DAN
               Catherine?
     Catherine stands up awkwardly and doesn't know if she
     should shake his hand or hug him or exte nd her hand for it
     to be kissed.
     Dan gently grabs her hand and leans in to kiss her on the
     cheek. Catherine leans in on the same angle. They almost
     kiss on the lips and do a "face dance".
     They laugh and sit down.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry to keep you waiting --
                                                29.
                      CATHERINE
          I just arrived myself.
                      DAN
          My lecture ran --
                      CATHERINE
          No no no. No apologies are
          necessary. I absolutely
          understand. When I was a student
          my long-winded essays most likely
          kept teachers late. Meaning: I
          get it.
Awkward silence.
Catherine smiles at Dan.
Dan smiles back.
                      DAN
          Well if your writing in essays was
          half as poetic as your writing in
          emails, I'm sure your teachers
          delighted in overtime .
Dan smiles.   Catherine blushes.
                      CATHERINE
          Do you bring all of your dates
          here?
                      DAN
          'All of my dates'. Ha. No. I
          don't date much. Too much of a
          busy-body for casual romance. No.
          This is new to me. Actually I
          have a confession to make.
                         CATHERINE
          What?
                      DAN
          I've never been on an online date.
Awkward silence.     Catherine blushes.
                               (CONT'D)
                         DAN
          What?
                         CATHERINE
          Nothing.
Dan doesn't press her.
                      DAN
          Well, I'm not one to in terrogate a
          woman on a first date.
Dan smiles and grabs the menu.
                         CATHERINE
          Okay.
                                                      30.
Catherine decides to plunge in anyway.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Well I didn't tell you everything
          online. But I was very honest in
          my profile when I said that I've
          never --
                      DAN
          Been on an online date?
                      CATHERINE
          No. Not just an online date.
          I've never been on a date.
                      DAN
          You're kidding.
                       CATHERINE
          No.
                      DAN
          You've never been out with a man?
                       CATHERINE
          Never.
                      DAN
          What a crime.
Catherine blushes.
                      CATHERINE
          Thank you for the complimen t, but
          it's true. This is my first time
          sitting across from a man in any
          type of romantic setting that may
          lead to romance if you -- you
          know. If something like that were
          to -- I mean if you were to like --
          me.
An attractive WAITRESS (20's) with bright red lips, walks
to the table with the wine list.
                      WAITRESS
          How are you this evening?
                       DAN
          Wonderful.
The waitress gives Dan a smile that borderlines flir ting.
Dan catches it, but ignores it out of respect for
Catherine.
Catherine's instinct tell her the Waitress is being
inappropriate, but as a dating novice, she attempts to
suppress her irritation.
                      DAN (CONT'D)
          What's your best red?
                                                           31.
                            WAITRESS
               Red.   For red I'd recommend --
                             CATHERINE
               No!
     Dan and the Waitress look to Catherine.
                             CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Um -- Um --
     She tries to disarm them with a smile.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               No thank you. I don't drink. It
               will mess with my -- um. Well I
               take things that don't work with --
     Catherine tries to backtrack.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               But you -- you -- you feel free to
               drink. I'm not an alcoholic or
               anything so it's not as though
               I'l l salivate like a hungry rat if
               I see it.
     Catherine sticks her tongue out and attempts to mimic a
     salivating rat.
     Amused, Dan smiles and turns to the Waitress.
                           DAN
               We're fine for the moment.     Thank
               you.
     The waitress leaves.
     Catherine gives Dan a shy smile.
                           CATHERINE
               You really could have ordered it.
                           DAN
               No, no. Best for people to meet
               under the eyes of sobriety.
     Catherine likes Dan more by the minute.
30   INT. H OUSE - ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT
     Catherine, now covered in bin bags with holes cut out for
     her limbs, wears utility gloves and a surgical mask.
     Dan's corpse sits in the tub on top of five or six of his
     suits. She doesn't want to get blood on the porcelain tub.
     His arm juts out over the side.
     Thick plastic covers the floor.
     Next to Catherine, empty bin bags wait for Dan's
     dismembere d limbs.
                                                           32.
     Catherine lifts the arm up and examines where she should
     make the first cut.
     She places the bow saw against the shoulder.
     Hmm - not right.
     She places it in the middle of his forearm.
     O.S. the same UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES spoken in a backwards
     language seep into the room.
                               CATHERINE
               Not.     Now.
31   EXT. BOAT - EARLY MORNING - 1993
     CATHERINE (7) sits in a small fishing boat with a PINK LIFE
     VEST on.
     Her DADDY (4 0's), sits next to Catherine in green flannels
     and fishing gear (his face is never seen).
     Both hold fishing rods.
     Catherine looks up at Daddy.
                               YOUNG CATHERINE
               Daddy --
                               DADDY
               Catherine?
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               I like it here. I don't ever want
               to go home.
                           DADDY
               Well -- we'll see.
     Catherine smiles up at him.
     Suddenly, Daddy's rod tugs violently.
                                       (CONT'D)
                           DADDY
               We caught one!
                               YOUNG CATHERINE
               Yeah!!
     Catherine jumps up and down in excitement.
     The boat rocks.
                           DADDY
               Steady -- Steady --
     Moments later -
     A fish flops around in a bucket.
     Catherine looks from the bucket to Daddy.
                                                             33.
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               What do we do now?
     Daddy pulls out his hunting knife.
     Catherine stares at the knife in fascination.
     The live fish slaps down onto a board.
     Daddy holds down the squirming fish with one hand and
     wields a knife in the other to demonstrate.
                            DADDY
               There's three ways to kill a fish
               humanely. One is you cut their
               throat. You go in here --
                    (knife on throat)
               And cut the blood vessels to the
               gill s. Or you can hit it on its
               head with this
                    (he points to a
                     small
                     donger/priest)
               Or you can brain spike em here.
                    (point to head)
               I find the brain spike to be the
               kindest way to send Mr. Fishy to
               heaven.
     Daddy angles the knife properly on top of the fish's head.
                           DADDY (CONT'D)
               Look away if you're squeamish
               princess.
     The fish flops around in terror.
     Catherine watches in fascination as Mr. Fishy's head is
     smashed and its brains splatter the board.
     END FLASHBACK
32   INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT
     The bathroom is deadly quiet.
     Catherine's bow saw still poised on Dan's forearm.
     Determined, she saws into Dan's flesh.
     Anita looms over her from behind.
                           ANITA
               Uh -- Do I need to be here for
               this?
                           CATHERINE
               For a girl who loves Goosebumps,
               you sure are queasy darling.
     Completely committed to the act of dismemb erment, Catherine
     saws with vigour.
                                                             34.
                           ANITA
               You'd better double bag it.
     Anita gags and back aways.
     The bottom half of Dan's arm falls to the floor.
     Catherine picks it up and throws it into a bin bag without
     hesitation or emotion.
33   INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - DUSK - 6 MONTHS AGO
     Catherine sits in Dan's office chair completely still
     wearing an elegant LITTLE BLACK DRESS. With coiffed hair
     and perfect make-up, she evokes 'Holly Golightly'.
     Dan 's laptop sits open on her lap.
     Shock, disgust and heavy disappointment play across her
     face.
     O.S. the front door slams shut.
                           DAN
               Catherine!? What's for dinner?
               Smells delicious! Hellooo!?
     Catherine stares at the screen, completely mortified.
34   INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
     The large dining room table is lovingly set out for a
     romantic dinner at one end.
     Dan sits at the opposite end with hea d in hands, totally
     ashamed of himself. His tie loose. The top shirt buttons
     open. He can't breath.
     Catherine, now slightly smudged, stands a good distance
     from him, like he's a leper.
     The laptop sits open on the dining table, facing Dan.
     This is the most serious moment of Catherine's life.    She
     needs to get this right.
     She closes the laptop and stares at Dan.
     Dan can't look at her.
     The tension's unbearable until finally --
                              CATHERINE
               Tell me.
     Dan squirms.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I want to know. I have a right to
               know --
     A tear runs down Dan's flushed cheek.
                                                            35.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Look at me Dan.
     Dan reluctantly meets her eyes.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I bared my soul to you. Every
               single dark crevice of it -- and
               you -- you kept this from me --
                           DAN
               Catherine please -- it's not --
                           CATHERINE
               I trusted you --
                           DAN
               I didn't know how to --
                           CATHERINE
               I want children, Dan.
                            DAN
               So do I.
                           CATHERINE
               How can we with this -- this
               history?
     Dan's taken aback.
                           DAN
               What are you -- I love children,
               Catherine. I'm sorry. I'll never
               do it again. Please. We can get
               through this --
     Catherine can't look at him anymore.
                           CATHERINE
               You need help.
     She storms out of the room.
     Dan crumples in his chair and stares at his closed laptop,
     angry and disgusted with himself.
35   INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT
     Catherine pulls Dan's leg over the edge of the tub.
     She carefully places the bow saw against his ank le.
     Her mind drifts.
     Dan's last words haunt her.
                           DAN
               Catherine it's not what you --
     She stifles an anguished scream.
     A moment of clarity.
                                                              36.
     She can't believe what she's done.
     A lump swells in her throat.     Eyes fill with tears.
     Her head drops.
                           CATHERINE
               I'm a monster.
                           ANITA
               He's the monster if you ask me.
                               CATHERINE
               Thank you.
     Catherine musters strength.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                   (to self)
               C'mon Catherine. C'mon --
     Deep breath.   Head up.    Eyes focused.
     She starts to saw Dan's foot off as silent tears run down
     her face.
36   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     Dan pro ds Catherine lightly.
                           DAN
               So -- are you under the weather?
                               CATHERINE
               What?
                            DAN
               Sick?   Are you sick?
                               CATHERINE
               Sick?
                           DAN
               Because you --
                           CATHERINE
               Oh! Because I said I was taking --
               Yes. I mean no! No I am not
               sick. I mean I was sick, I was,
               but I'm not -- anymore.
     Dan's confused.
     Catherine gathers herself before --
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Okay. Let's say that we "like"
               each other and that we become a
               "couple". You were on the website
               because you were looking to be in
               a relationship, right?
                               DAN
               That I was.
                                                        37.
                      CATHERINE
          Cool. Good. So we both want to
          be in relationships. And once
          you're in a relationship you find
          out all these things about your
          partner that maybe they were
          hiding early on so as not to scare
          the other person off and be left
          in the dust, right? That is how
          relationships work -- right?
Dan laughs lightheartedly.
Catherine turns serious.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What's so funny?
                        DAN
          You.
                      CATHERINE
          Why are you laughing at me?
                      DAN
          No, no, no.   I'm not laughing AT
          you, but rather WITH you.
                      CATHERINE
          With me? I don't understand.
          I'm not laughing. I was trying to
          be honest about something
          personal.
                      DAN
          When someone says they're laughing
          with you it just means that they
          like you.
                        CATHERINE
          Oh.    I didn't know that.
Catherine makes a mental note of this.
Dan tries hard to hold his laughter but he can't help
himself and a cough/laugh slips out.
Catherine studies Dan with intensity.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          So -- you like me?
                      DAN
          Yes.   You're very funny.      And yes
          -- I like you.
                        CATHERINE
          Yeah!    You like me.
Dan tries to control his laughter.
Catherine can't help but join in.      Then --
                                                            38.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                So anyway -- would you like to
                know what's wrong with me?
     O.S. a DULL THUMP - THUMP -
37   INT. HOUSE - LOWER STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT - PRESENT
     - THUMP.
     A large bin bag filled with Dan's limbs land hard on the
     final step.
     With a streak of BLOOD across her cheek and CLEAN GLOVES
     on, Catherine blows loose hair away from her flushed face
     and catches her breath.
     As she heaves the bag up --
     O.S. a LOW V OICE drifts towards her.
     She looks up.
     Her face crumples as the VOICE becomes clearer and she is
     faced with -
     DAN's broad back as he WHISPERS into his mobile. His suit
     jacket and LAPTOP CASE strewn across the side table.
     Longing and disappointment play across her face.
     She makes her way cautiously towards him.   The bin bag
     teeters dangerously on the step.
     As she gets closer, Dan's words become clearer .
                            DAN
                    (whispering)
                -- Yes. Yes, that's exactly
                right. I'm at a complete loss
                here. It's just -- I'm ashamed --
                I'm ashamed I didn't ring sooner.
                I just thought -- I was afraid to -
                - Yes, I did try but she won't --
     Catherine stops inches from Dan and reaches out to touch
     him.
                            CATHERINE
                Who are you talking to --
     Spooked, DAN sharply turns around --
     But it's ANITA's shocked face that confronts her.
                            ANITA
                Catherine I --
     Catherine takes in Anita holding the LANDLINE RECEIVER.
     A FEMALE EMERGENCY SERVICE VOICE is muffled by Anita's
     hand.
                                                      39.
Catherine turns cold and threatening.
                      CATHERINE
          Who are you talking to?
Anita clocks the bin bag.
                       ANITA
          That him?
                      CATHERINE
          Parts of him.
Anita half-gags.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          You clean his office?
                      ANITA
          Yeah.
                      CATHERINE
          Hallway floors?
                      ANITA
          Yeah.
                      CATHERINE
          Closet?
                      ANITA
          Cleaned.
                      CATHERINE
          Good girl. Who the fuck are you
          talking to darling?
                      ANITA
          You asked me here to help --
Without flinching, Catherine rips the receiver from Anit a's
shaking hand, ends the call and rips the cord out of the
wall.
                      CATHERINE
          You call that helping? Seriously,
          when did you become so demented
          Anita? You know what they'll do
          to me. They'll send me back
          there. And this time they'll
          never let me out. Is that what
          you want?
                      ANITA
          No but -- this is bat shit crazy
          Catherine.
Catherine leans hard into Anita - it's sensual.
                      CATHERINE
          You have a short memo ry of what
          that really is.
Catherine turns and grabs the bin bag.
                                                            40.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Now go start a fire.
                           ANITA
               Catherine -- I really --
                           CATHERINE
               We are not calling the police!
     Catherine walks past Anita dragging the bin bag behind her.
38   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     A cold-coloured room. An old wooden desk. A creepy cheap
     flower print on the wall beside a ticking silver clock.
     It's clinical and institutional.
     Fluorescent lights flicker from the low ceiling.
     A SECURITY CAMERA sits in a top corner of the room.
     CATHERINE, AGED 15, sits on a chair in PINK PYJAMAS.
     She's agitated and swings her legs in frustration.
     The door opens.   She sits up straight.
     DETECTIVE REESE (mid 40's) female, walks into the room with
     a note pad and a CAN OF FIZZY POP. She wears a dark
     coloured suit. She knows Catherine is deeply troubled and
     approaches her with calculating care.
     Catherine tracks every move Detective Reese makes as she
     sets the can on the table in front of her and pulls up a
     chair.
     Reese sits down with the note pad in her lap and pulls a
     pen out from her suit.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Hello Catherine. My name is
               Detective Reese. I know you've
               been through a lot tonight. I
               want you to relax. This is a safe
               space here.
     Catherine fidgets.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Where's Anita?
                                DETECTIVE REESE
               Yes.    Anita.
     Reese gives Catherine a disarming smile and studies her
     carefully.
                           DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               Catherine, I'm going to ask you
               some questions. We'll start
               simple and then work our way
               through. How does that sound?
     Catherine rapidly nods her head, almost 'head-banging'.
                                                       41.
                         DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
          Wonderful.     May I have your name
          and age?
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          First name Catherine. Surname
          Blake. Fifteen and a half years
          of age. IQ: 148. Non drug user.
          Shellfish allergies.
Reese makes notes.
Under the table, Catherine tugs at her pyjamas. Her leg
swings nervously and she kicks Reese in the shin.
Reese looks up sharply from her notepad.
Catherine blushes.
                                            (CONT'D)
                         TEEN CATHERINE
          Sorry.
                      DETECT IVE REESE
          Quite alright.
Uncomfortable silence, then Reese proceeds cautiously.
                      DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
          Catherine, why do you think you're
          here?
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          Anita stabbed Daddy.
                         DETECTIVE REESE
          Anita.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          Where's Mother? What is she
          saying?
                      DETECTIVE REESE
          Your Mother --
                         TEEN CATHERINE
          Yes!     Tell me what she said!
                      DETECTIVE REESE
          She found you with --
Catherine kicks back her chair and slams the table.
                      TEE N CATHERINE
          She's a fucking liar --
O.S. A CACOPHONY OF SOUND scorches Catherine's mind. She
squeezes her head. A moan escapes the side of her mouth.
Reese doesn't flinch, but slowly slides the pen back in her
pocket.
                         DETECTIVE REESE
          Catherine --
                                                         42.
Catherine's glazed eyes refocus on Reese.
                       DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
          It's okay.   You're not in trouble.
Catherine calms a little and slumps back into her chair.
Reese cracks open the SODA and slides it across to
Catherine.
She sips it.   Her hands shake.    Liquid fizzes over.
O.S. a KNOCK on the door.
Reese know's who it is.
                      DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
          Now Catherine, I've asked a nice
          woman named Charmaine to come in
          and talk with you. Your Mother
          will be present.
Catherine let's out a loud CHORTLE and takes another sip of
soda.
Detective Reese opens the door and in walks PSYCHIATRIST,
DR. CHARMAINE JOHNSON (50s) holding a notepad and pencil.
Friendly and dressed with a cultural flair, she gives
Catherine a warm smile.
Catherine's Mother, BETTY (40's) follows sheepishly behind.
She's blousy with too much make up, b ig hair and long fake
fingernails. Red eyed and on edge, she's wired on coffee
and too many uppers. Extreme paranoia consumes her as she
avoids Catherine's death stare and sits in a chair behind
her.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          What did you tell them Mother.
Detective Reese throws Charmaine a conspiratorial look and
leaves.
Charmaine addresses Catherine and speaks in a calm manner.
                       CHARMAINE
          Catherine.
Catherine t urns her head sharply from Betty to Charmaine.
                      CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
          My name is Dr. Charmaine Johnson --
Catherine smirks in defiance and gives her a knowing look,
like she's the smartest person in the room.
                      CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
          And I'd like to ask you a few
          questions. Alright?
Super confident, Catherine gestures for Charmaine to
continue.
                                                     43.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          By all means Charmaine.
                      CHARMAINE
          Do you know why you're here?
Catherine rolls her eyes and nods her head back towards her
mother.
Betty gasps, aghast at the accusation.
                      CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
          Do you blame your Mother?
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          I blame her for ratting on Anita.
Betty scoffs.
                      TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
              (to Charmaine)
          Look -- I don't cause trouble, I
          always do my chores. A model
          teenager --
Betty tries to defend h erself.
                      BETTY
          The girl talks to herself!
                      CHARMAINE
              (to Betty)
          Fluid conversations --
                      BETTY
          Fluid conversations! She hardly
          eats, and when she does she just
          giggles at her food with Anita.
          Giggles at the potatoes. Giggles
          at the carrots. Giggles at the
          whole bloody stew!
                       TEEN CATHERINE
          May I -
                      BETTY
          All she does is giggle with Anita.
          Talk to Anita --
                       TEEN CATHERINE
          May I -
                      BETTY
          Anita, Anita, Anita. This ha s been
          going on for EIGHT YEARS! --
                      CHARMAINE
          Mrs. Blake have you ever taken
          Catherine to be assessed --
Betty looks at Charmaine like she's speaking a foreign
language.
Catherine loses her patience.
                                                    44.
                       TEEN CATHERINE
           May I interject!
SILENCE.
Indignant and accusatory looks pass between them.
                       CHARMAINE
           Go ahead Catherine.
                       BETTY
           All the other children on our
           street --
                       CHARMAINE
           Betty -- Give Catherine room to
           respond.
Betty bites her lower lip.
                       CATHERINE
           Thank you Charmaine. Look, I
           simply don't care what Mother
           thinks. My entire existence is
           one of balance and dignity with
           Anita -- it's not my fault she's
           threatened by her. I'm just happy
           to spend time alone with my
           friend.
                       BETTY
           Oh Kitkat darling -- you're a
           laughing stock.
                       TEEN CATHERINE
           I am not a laughing stock Mother --
           and it's Catherine --
                       BETTY
           But you are -- Kitkat --
Catherine rails on her.
                        TEEN CATHERINE
           I am not!   I'm special!
Betty scoffs.
Charmaine is disturbed by this exchange. Betty is clearly
just as unstable as Catherine - even given the
circumstances.
Catherine turns to Charmaine in seriousness.
                       TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           And I don't mean 'SPECIAL' in the
           way in which one describes a
           retard out of some abstract
           concept of respecting what we
           pity. I'm LITERALLY special.
She's dead serious.
                                                           45.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I have powers. Very impressive
               powers.
     She looks back at her mother, then to Charmaine.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I can see things that others
               can't.
     Betty opens her mouth - Charmaine puts up a hand to stop
     her.
     Charmaine turns her head and looks to the opposite wall and
     it's the first time we see a LARGE ONE-WAY MIRROR. She
     gives the mirror a little nod and looks back to Catherine.
     She treads lightly.
                           CHARMAINE
               Catherine, Detective Reese is
               going to join us. There's nothing
               to be afraid of. Alright?
     Catherine's suspicious, but doesn't protest.
39   EXT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - NIGHT - PRESENT
     Anita smokes and stands over the drum, the low fire
     illuminates her concerned face.
     Catherine ignores Anita and drops a bin bag with Dan's
     dismembered corpse on the ground beside another one.
     She picks up a log and throws it in the drum.
     The fire CRACKLES to life.
     Catherine picks up a poker and stokes the fire.
     Anita takes Catherine's other hand and watches Catherine
     lost in thought.
40   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     The door opens.
     Detective Reese walks in and following behind her is --
     ANITA, AGED 15. A splatter of DRIED BLOOD sticks to her
     school uniform that's been stretched and personalised to
     ha ve a punk rock feel.
     She sticks her tongue out behind Detective Reese's head.
     Catherine brightens.   They share a mocking smile.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
                   (to Anita)
               Where the hell were you?
                                                        46.
                      TEEN ANITA
              (nods to Reese)
          Being grilled by this one.
                         TEEN CATHERINE
          You confess?
                      TEEN ANITA
          Told them I did everything.
                         TEEN CATHERINE
          Good girl.
Detective Reese and Charmaine exchange looks as she sits
down beside her.
                         CHARMAINE
          Catherine --
Catherine darts her head from Anita to Charmaine.
Charmaine looks towards Anita.
                      CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
          Welcome, Anita.
Betty scoffs.
                                          Catherine does the
Anita sticks her tongue out at Betty.
same.
They laugh.
Reese and Charmaine give each other a cautious look.
Charmaine clears her throat.
                      CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
          Catherine has Anita ever hurt you?
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          Like my feelings? Of course.
          When she's in a mood. But I'm no
          angel either. The important thing
          is that we make up and move on.
          Right, Anita?
Anita blows Catherine a kiss.    She catches it and smacks it
on her cheek with force.
                      CHARM AINE
          Has Anita ever hurt you --
          physically?
                       TEEN CATHERINE
          Physically? Why would she hurt me
          physically? Who do you think I
          surround myself with? A bunch of
          psychopaths?
                      BETTY
          Obviously there's violence in her.
          I'm a dead woman. Buy the casket
          now, darling. Buy the casket now.
                                                       47.
Catherine rolls her head towards Betty and looks her
directly in the eye.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          Really Mother? Is that what you
          think? You think voices in my
          head are telling me to kill you?
Catherine's smile turns sinister.
                      TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          If I wanted to kill you you'd
          already be dead.
Betty gasps.    Her hand flies to her throat.
Anita laughs.    Catherine laughs with Anita.
                       TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
              (to Reese)
          Obviously I 'm joking.
                      DETECTIVE REESE
          But if you were to harm your
          mother -- how would you do it?
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          You mean my 'Modus Operandi'?
                        DETECTIVE REESE
          Sure.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          Well. I'd sneak into her room and
          stab her while she sleeps.
Betty nearly falls out of her chair.
                        BETTY
          Dear lord!
Catherine and Anita laugh at Betty.
                        DETECTIVE REESE
          Stab her?
                        TEEN CATHERINE
          Yes.
                      DETECTIVE REESE
          Stab her with what?
Catherine's eeri ly cheery.
                      TEEN CATHERINE
          The knife under my bed.
                        TEEN ANITA
          Duh.
Betty turns white and looks about to faint.
Charmaine rushes to her aid.
                                                             48.
                          CHARMAINE
               Mrs. Blake, let's get you some
               fresh air.
     Triumphant, Catherine and Anita 'high five'.
     Catherine smirks at Betty as Charmaine leads her out.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               You keep a knife under your bed?
     Anita yawns in boredom.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
                   (to Anita)
               I know, I know.
     Anita taps her wrist to signal it's time to go.
                              TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I'm trying!
     Anita opens her mouth wide. Her tongue FIZZES and POPS
     with RED and BLUE ROCK POPS.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Knock it off Anita.
                              DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine --
     Catherine's had enough now.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Look Detective Reese. My grades
               are of the highest merit. I don't
               smoke, drink, or take drugs.  AND
               --
     Catherine makes air circles above her crotch.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I'm still a virgin.   Tell me
               where the problem exists.
     Catherine stands with confidence.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Now if you wo uld be so kind as to
               let us return home. Anita and I
               are writing a novella.
                             DETECTIVE REESE
               A novella?    How exciting. What's
               it about?
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               It's called: ZEBRA GIRL.
41   INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]
     A PINK and RED colour schemed room. Stuffed animals. Doll
     house. Twin bed with a modest frame, a slight tear in the
     wallpaper above it.
                                                             49.
     The room hasn't changed since she was 7.
     Catherine (15) and Anita (15) lie on the floor, a blank RED
     EXCERCISE BOOK before them.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               It should be a novella. That's a
               short novel, Anita.
                           TEEN ANITA
               What's it about?
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               It's about an almighty girl who
               can turn into a Zebra when her
               human father sneaks into her room
               at night. It's based on your
               family. Is that okay with you?
                           TEEN ANI TA
               Mmmm -- just so long as it makes
               me look powerful.
                            TEEN CATHERINE
               Powerful?   You're a god in this!
     Anita loves it.
                           TEEN ANITA
               I'll do the illustrations!
     END FLASHBACK
42   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Once it's published, girls
               everywhere will know they can have
               Zebra powers too.
     Catherine puts her arm out for Anita.      Anita grabs her
     arm.
                              DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine --
                              TEEN CATHERINE
               Whaaaaat?
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               How does the story end?
     Catherine turns to Anita.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               How does the story end Anita?
     Catherine listens intently to Anita's whispering and nods
     in fascination.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Anita says that in the end, Zebra
               Girl mauls her human father.
                           (MORE)
                                                             50.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               She bites off his head and slowly
               digests him inside of her acidic
               Zebra stomach. Then she shits him
               out of her soul. Happy ending.
     Catherine waits with her arm around Anita, cheery smile on
     her face.
     Detective Reese looks towards the mirror, her face a mix of
     horror and sympathy.
     Catherine follows Detective Reese's gaze to the mirror.
43   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     On the opposite side of the mirror, Betty holds her throat
     in horror. She stares at her daughter like she's an alien
     and can't understand where it all went wrong. Silent tears
     run down her face.
     Charmaine and TWO FEMALE DETECTIVES stand next to her
     watching Catherine with fascination.
                           FEMALE DETECTIVE
               She on medication?
     Charmaine looks to Betty.    No answer.
44   EXT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - NIGHT - PRESENT
     The fire is brighter now as Catherine continuous to stoke
     it, lost in thought.
     Anita smokes nervously.
                           ANITA
               You ever finish it?
                           CATHERINE
               Well -- our original idea sort of
               manifested itself in life.
     They share a 'gallows humour' chuckle.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Dan told me it deserved a truly
               happy ending.
     Anita's hurt and offended.
                           ANITA
               Adorable. Can't believe you told
               him about it.
                           CATHERINE
               Yep. Prince Charming comes along
               and accepts Zebr a Girl for all her
               wickedly beautiful stripes.
                           ANITA
               That's 'Pretty Fuckin' Woman'
               adorable.
     Anita puts two fingers in her mouth and mocks a gag.
                                                             51.
45   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     Catherine stands at the mirror, nose inches from the glass.
     She stares at it with hate, almost in front of where Betty
     stands behind it.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Is Mother in there?
     Reese tries to focus her.
                              DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine --
     Catherine suddenly lets rip an ALMIGHTY FERAL SCREAM at the
     glass that tapers into what sounds like a wounded animal.
     Reese moves to her side and tries to calm her.
                           DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               Catherine. Look at me. It's ok.
               Look at me. It's all right.
     Catherine darts her eyes to Reese.
                              DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               That's it.
     She calms a little and Reese guides her to her chair.
     Reese sits opposite.
                           DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               Now. I need to ask you a few more
               questions about tonight. You just
               take your time and answer when
               you're ready. How does that
               sound?
     Catherine rapidly nods her head.
                           DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               Ok good. Now, to the best of your
               recollection, walk me through the
               sequence of events beginning with
               your father entering your bedroom.
     Catherine stares at Reese with glazed eyes and speaks in a
     trance like state.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Anita and I were playing in our
               room. No, Studying. We were
               studying in our room. 19th
               Century literature.
                              DETECTIVE REESE
               148.
                              TEEN CATHERINE
               148.
     Catherine stares at the mirror again.
                                                             52.
                              DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine --
     Catherine turns from the mirror back to Detective Reese,
     her pen poised for notes.
                           DETECTIVE REESE (CONT'D)
               There you are. Hi. You're
               studying in your room and --
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               It's all a bit of a blur.
     O.S. a PIERCING SOUND followed by a cacophony of
     UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES spoken in a backwards language that
     grows in volume and vehemence.
     Catherine's vision blurs into --
46   INT. CHILD HOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
     Catherine (15) and Anita (15) lay side by side on their
     bellies facing the headboard. MARY SHELLY's 'FRANKENSTEIN:
     OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS' lies between them.
     While Catherine reads, Anita picks at the wallpaper.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               After we finished studying, Anita
               turned the lights off.
     Anita turns the light off.
     They lie on their sides and face each other. Anita takes
     Cath erine's hand and gives her a quick peck on the lips.
     They take a deep breath and attempt to fall asleep in
     unison.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               After we fell asleep -- I found
               myself reading a book with Daddy.
               I thought I was dreaming.
     A low night-light shines onto Catherine's bed.
     DADDY, his face obscured, sits shoulder to shoulder next to
     her against the headboard as they read 'FLOWERS IN THE
     ATTIC' by V.C. A NDREWS. Catherine holds one end of the
     book and Daddy holds the other. The book is almost
     finished.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               When we read together. He likes
               it when I hold one end of the book
               and he holds the other. Two
               people who love each other holding
               paper.
     Their hands on each end of the book.
                                                          53.
                           TEEN CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Well -- Anita sees this and
               explodes into a fit of jealous
               rage.
     From the dark, Anita lunges, grabs Daddy by his shirt and
     yanks him off of the bed.
                                               (CONT'D)
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Anita!   Stop!
     The book flies through the air.
                           CATHERINE
               Anita thought Daddy was trying to
               hurt me but we were simply reading
               a late 70's classic.
47   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     Deadly serious, Catherine doesn't blink.
     Reese slides her pen back into her jacket and proceeds with
     sensitivity.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine, what I'm about to ask
               you next may make you --
               uncomfortable.
     Catherine stares down Reese.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Detective, don't you think that if
               Daddy were trying to hurt me that
               I'd be able to sort it out myself?
               Do you think I'm some internally
               vulnerable victim? Well I'm not
               that. Trust me. I am not a
               victim. I told you. I'm ZEBRA
               GIRL.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               I only ask to better understand
               Anita's intentions.
                              TEEN CATHERINE
               Detective --
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Catherine, there's an examination -
               -
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               What do you mean by 'rape
               examination'?
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Well, I didn't use those exact
               words --
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               I won't take it.
                                                            54.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               It would only help us understand --
                            TEEN CATHERINE
               He didn't do anything! I wish he
               were still alive. Lord, If I were
               going to kill anyone it would have
               been Mother.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Why?
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Because I hate her.
                           DETECTIVE REESE
               Why?
     The sudden notes of a kitsch 1960's song floats into --
48   INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]
                               The song blares fr om the radio.
     -- The Blake's kitchen.
     A blood soaked package of meat slams down on a worn
     chopping board. Blood oozes out.
                           DADDY
               For the stew.
     Daddy scrubs his rough hands.
     Betty watches him from the corner of her eye and sips a
     large G&T.
     Daddy towers over Catherine (15) at the kitchen table.
     He strokes the top of Catherine's head.
                           DADDY (CONT'D)
                   (to Catherine)
               Hello, sweetheart.
                   (to Betty)
               Fix me a Scotch, Betty.
                           BETTY
               Fix him a Scotch , Catherine.
                           DADDY
                   (to Betty)
               You do it!
     He continues to stroke Catherine's hair. Catherine looks
     from Daddy to Betty with great discomfort.
     Jealous, Betty turns and downs a pill with her G&T and
     walks out.
     Catherine watches her go with hate filled eyes.
49   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
     Catherine can't hold it in any longer.
                                                            55.
                            TEEN CATHERINE
                Because she's a lonely,
                depressive, pill-popping blame-
                gamer -- and she hates me.
                            DETECTIVE REESE
                Why?
                            TEEN CATHERINE
                Because he likes me more than her!
50   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
     Betty gasps and turns white.
     Charmaine and the Female Detectives simultaneously look to
     Betty.
51   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
     Silence.
     Detective Reese connects the dots.
                            DETECTIVE REESE
                I'm so sorry Catherine.
                            TEEN CA THERINE
                What for? I'm fine. Feel sorry
                for yourself. This is a waste of
                your time as much as it is mine.
     The UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES return with a vengeance and swarm
     Catherine's mind.
     The CACOPHONY crescendos, Catherine covers her ears and
     takes a deep breath --
     The SOUNDS dissipate as Catherine looks up through
     disheveled hair.
     ANITA stands behind Detective Reese dressed like POIROT.
     Moustache and all.
     She sticks her chin up and imitates Poirot.
                            TEEN ANITA
                I'm from France. I'm from France -
                -
                            TEEN CATHERINE
                You're from Belgium --
                            TEEN ANITA
                I'm from France.
     Catherine and Anita laugh.
     Anita's suddenly beside Catherine and turns serious.
                            TEEN ANITA (CONT'D)
                Play it strong here Catherine.
                                                          56.
     Catherine switches to control mode and stands.
                           TEEN CATHERINE
               Listen, Detective. I respect the
               sensitivity you're displaying in
               the face of what appears to be
               chaotic madness. But it's as
               basic as this: Anita is jealous of
               Daddy. Mother is jealous of me.
               Anita stabbed Daddy out of
               jealousy and you're trying to find
               out who did what for whatever
               reasons. I'm aware that Anita
               will have to go away for a while.
               But she's only fifteen. Three
               years in a juvenile correctional
               facility? Good. She could use
               it. At that point she'll be
               eighteen and able to start up her
               life again. Right?
     The CACOPHONY OF VOICES pierce through and hit a ten then --
     SILENCE over SECURITY CAMERA POV:
     CATHERINE STANDS IN A DISHEVELLED MESS, HER PINK PYJAMAS
     COVERED IN DRIED BLOOD.
     Anita has VANISHED.
52   INT. RESTA URANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     Catherine stops laughing and turns serious --
                           CATHERINE
               When I was fifteen I killed my
               father.
     Dan stops laughing.
     The piano player smiles at the room.
     Catherine looks around the restaurant to see if anyone
     overheard.
     She waits for Dan's response.
     Dan clears his throat and wiggles in his chair.
                           DAN
               You're -- THAT -- Catherine?
53   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - 2001
                            CATHERINE
               Yes.
     Cat herine smiles at Detective Reese.
     Neither move.
                           DAN
               You're Catherine Blake?
                                                             57.
     The security camera zooms in on BLOODY CATHERINE and
     EXPLODES INTO WHITE FRAMES --
                            DAN (CONT'D)
               Wow.   You were a national --
54   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     Dan stares at Catherine with awe and morbid interest.
                           DAN
               They never showed your face.
     Catherine nods and takes a sip of water.
                           CATHERINE
               My mother never believed -- It was
               a very abusive relationship
               between Daddy and Mother. And
               between her and me . Most
               importantly it was abuse between
               him -- and -- me.
55   INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]
     Daddy sits next to CATHERINE (15) in bed.    He holds the
     book "FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC".
     Catherine wears the same PINK PYJAMAS.
     Daddy gently strokes the back of Catherine's NECK.
     Catherine is almost comatose as she distractedly picks at
     the wallpaper. Through the layers an old ZEBRA PRINT
     WALLPAPE R is revealed where Catherine picks at it.
     O.S. the SOUND OF A BELT BUCKLE coming undone, followed by
     A ZIPPER.
     Catherine's eyes are dead as Daddy takes Catherine's hand
     and guides it under the covers as he softly sings --
                           DADDY
               The itsy bitsy spider climbs up
               the water spout.
     Catherine is suddenly pushed unto her belly.
     Her eyes flicker to life in fear.   Tears sting her eyes.
                           DADDY (CONT'D)
               Down came the rai n and washed the
               Spider out --
                           CATHERINE
               One night, after a decade of
               pretending that it wasn't
               happening. Daddy was about to
               take it to the next level and --
     Catherine nudges to the edge of the bed and slowly reaches
     for something underneath.
                                                           58.
                              DADDY
                  Out came the sun and dried up all
                  the rain --
     Taped under the mattress is a BUTCHER'S KNIFE. Below the
     knife on the floor is a STACK OF OLD GOOSEBUMP BOOKS.
     Catherine struggles at first, then detaches the knife.
     Daddy looms large behind her.
                                      (CONT'D)
                              DADDY
                  And the itsy bitsy spider climbed
                  up --
     She quickly turns to face Daddy, the KNIFE raised above her
     head --
     A FLASH OF SILVER BLADE SLASHES THE AIR -
                              CATHERINE
                  I stabbed him.
56   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     She looks Dan straight in the eye.
                              CATHERINE
                  Stabbed him right in the right
                  temporal lobe.
     Dan gulps.
57   INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT - [FLASHBACK]
     Catherine falls backward.
     The knife stuck in Daddy's brain.
     She stands looking down at his body in shock.
58   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
                               CATHERINE
                  The court said because I had the
                  kni fe waiting that it was
                  premeditated.
     Terrified, intrigued and fascinated, Dan's lost for words.
     The waitress appears from nowhere.
                              WAITRESS
                  Are we --
                              CATHERINE
                  No we are NOT. I will signal you
                  when we are ready to order.
     Catherine gives the Waitress daggers and watches her leave.
     Dan tries to keep his shit together and pours more water
     into their glasses.
                                                            59.
                           DAN
               Were you in an adult prison?
     Catherine slowly turns to face Dan.   She's still in
     'possessed' mode.
                              CATHERINE
               What?
                           DAN
               Adult -- prison?
                           CATHERINE
               Adult prison? No. I wasn't there
               --
     Catherine takes a deep breath.
59   OVER WHITE:
     A BARRAGE OF SOUNDS --
     - Handcuffs.
     - Transport.
     - CLANKING as several feet shuffle down a hall.
     - Teenage girls LAUGHING.
     - Heavy metal doors SLAM shut and LOCK.
     - Disturbed patients in a mental institution.
     The SOUNDS REVERB into SILENCE.
     A single clock TICKING pierces through and into --
60   INT. MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION - ROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]
     - A white room with a single bed.
     Morning light creates odd shadows through barred windows.
     CATHERINE, AGED 19, with SHORTER HAIR wears institution
     garb and sits alone on her bed, staring at the ceiling.
                           CATHERINE
               I was diagnosed as a -- I was
               diagnosed with --
61   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
     Catherine struggles to get the words out. This 'diagnosis'
     is far more embarrassing to admit than the murder of her
     father.
                           CATHERINE
               I had no real friends. I don't
               know why. Never had them before
               Anita. And then of course AFTER
               Anita, who would be friends with
               me? And my god was she fabulous.
                                                          60.
     Dan's confused as hell.
                            DAN
               Anita?
                           CATHERINE
               I mean once we went into the
               nuthouse together, the bitch was
               always running around with the
               other maniac's imaginary friends.
               She'd be gone for months on end.
     Catherine chuckles at the memory and nearly drops a tear.
62   INT. MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION - ROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]
     CATHERINE (19) sits on the bed reading a book on
     HORTICULTURE. Behind her, a CHART on the wall lists all
     the reasons why it's 'good' to take your medication while a
     stack of RED WORKBOOKS with 'ZEBRA GIRL' written on the
     front sit idle on her bedside table.


     A NURSE (50's) unlocks the door and walks in. She holds
     out a small cup of pills and a small cup of water.
     Catherine stares at them both. She glances at the
     workbooks before giving in and downing the pills.
                            CATHERINE
               Of course , I know why she'd
               disappear. I started taking the
               medicine. They wouldn't have
               released me had I not proven
               through years of hard work that I
               could recognise the correlation.
     Catherine hands the cup back to Nurse.
     Catherine stares at the ceiling - a lonely figure.
                                      (CONT'D)
                           CATHERINE
               But I'd miss her. God I'd miss
               her.
63   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
                            CATHERINE
               And I'd be so lonely when all the
               neuron s were functioning the way
               the doctors desired. I'd go off
               my medication just to get her
               back.
64   INT. MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION - ROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]
     TWO LARGE FEMALE GUARDS (30's) hold Catherine (19) down
     while the NURSE attempts to give her a shot in the arm.
     Catherine screams and kicks to avoid the needle.
                            CATHERINE
               Get away!   Get away from me!
                                                            61.
                           NURSE
               This is what happens when you fake
               swallow, Catherine.
                           CATHERINE
               I won't take it!
     Catherine spits in the Nurses face.
                                         (CONT'D)
                           CATHERINE
               Fucking cunt!
     In her uncontrollable fury, Catherine BANGS her nose
     against the door frame. Blood sprays.
     Nurse wipes her face and takes the opportunity to inject
     the needle.
                                         (CONT'D)
                           CATHERINE
               Help me, Anita!
                           ANITA
               Can't Catherine.
                           CATHERINE
               Anita, please --
                           NURSE
                            That's it.     It's all
               Calm down.
               for the better.
     Catherine cries as her struggle subsides.
65   EXT. MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION/PET CEMETARY - COMMUNAL ROOM
     - DAY [FLASHBACK]
     Catherine's hair has grown somewhat and a small bandage
     covers her nose as she kneels in the dirt of the PET
     CEMETARY and vacantly plants bright pink flowers for the
     latest victim.
     Behind her, TWO FEMALE PATIENTS with EASTER BASKETS and
     FLUFFY BUNNY TAILS eagerly hunt for EASTER EGGS nearby.
     One says 'HELLO' to Catherine, but she's oblivious.
                           CATHERINE
               This cycle went on for years.
               It's why I was trapped there until
               I was twenty-six. But I had to
               get normal. Or else what the hell
               --
66   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 5 YEARS AGO
                           CATHERINE
               I'd die a virgin.
     Catherine's lost in the memory.
     Dan tries to make eye contact.
                            DAN
               Catherine.
                                                 62.
Nothing.
                        DAN (CONT'D)
           Catherine?
Catherine looks at Dan.
                               (CONT'D)
                        DAN
           Thank you.
                        CATHERINE
           For what?
                       DAN
           For trusting me. For sharing with
           me. For your unadulterated
           honesty. You're an inspiration.
                       CATHERINE
           Ha. Inspiration? To whom?      Jack
           The Ripper?
They share an ironic laugh.
                       CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           You can leave now. I'll
           understand.
                       DAN
           Why would I leave? This seems
           like the beginning of a never-a-
           dull-moment romance.
They share an awkward laugh of relief.
                       DAN (CONT'D)
           Plus I'm a square. And you're
           stunning. And you write beautiful
           emails.
                       CATHERINE
           And I'm better now. For quite
           some time. The medicine. It
           really does help.
After a moment, Dan raises his glass of water.
                       DAN
           To leaving the past where it
           belongs.
Catherine raises her glass.
They clink and sip over strong eye contact.
She lets out a deep sigh of relief.
                       CATHERINE
           So, as you're still sitting here --
           I suppose it's your turn.
                       DAN
           My turn for what?
                                                             63.
                           CATHERINE
               Your turn to tell me any dirty
               little secrets that I'd eventually
               discover two years into our
               marriage.
     A flirty smile passes between them.
     This could be the beginning of 'under the cherry tree'
     love.
     The SOUND of WOOD BURNING builds and carries into --
67   EXT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - NIGHT
     -- The fire burns high in the drum.     Catherine and Anita
     stare into its bright orange glow.
                            CATHERINE
               Do you k now what he told me his
               dirty little secret was? That he
               liked reality television.
     Catherine laughs in disgust and violently pokes the raging
     fire.
                           ANITA
               And you believed him?    Wow.   That
               was stupid.
     Anita anxiously lights another cigarette.
                            ANITA (CONT'D)
               Brave.   But Stupid.
     Catherine sets down the poker, reaches into a bin bag and
     grabs one of Dan's feet.
                           CATHERINE
               Stupid is as stupid does.
     Without hesitation, she tosses it into the fire.
68   INT. ENSUITE BATHROOM - DAY - 1 MONTH AGO
     Thick steam fills the bathroom.
     Catherine sits on the side of the tub, entranced by hot
     water flowing from the tap into a nearly full tub of
     bubbles.
     Her face is hard to read. A mixture of joy and fear. Her
     eyes focus on a BOTTLE OF PILLS and glass of water on the
     stool in front of her.
     She turns off the tap.
     Her robe hits the fl oor and she disappears into the tub.
     A PREGNANCY TEST with a POSITIVE SIGN lies on the bath matt
     next to her discarded robe.
                                                          64.
69   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY - 1 MONTH AGO
     A plain GPs office.
     DR. ANTO (40s), with an intelligent face, explains options
     to Catherine and Dan, who sit opposite her and anxiously
     hold hands.
                            DR. ANTO
                -- So for example, the Stemetil
                you've been on for several years
                is associated with a higher risk
                of malformations in the first
                trimester.
                            DAN
                And after that?
                            DR. ANTO
                After that, the risks increase and
                vary at different stages of your
                pregnancy. Stats are based off
                limited studies though --
     Catherine stops listening, her gaze drifts to the window.
     Dr. Anto looks from her to Dan with concern.
                               DR. ANTO (CONT'D)
                Catherine --
     Catherine turns back and gives her a little smile.
                            DR. ANTO (CONT'D)
                There are newer forms of low
                dosage antipsychotics you can try
                that reduce the risk of side
                effects.
                             CATHERINE
                Dr. Anto, thank you so much for
                your time --
     Catherine stands and stretches her hand out.
     Dr.   Anto takes it.
                            DR. ANTO
                Catherine, we should talk about
                options --
                             CATHERINE
                We will.
                    (to Dan)
                Let's go sweetie.
     Catherine leaves the room.
     Dan stands, confused and embarrassed.
                             DAN
                I -- well --
                    (to Dr. Anto)
                Thank you for your time Doctor.
                                                          65.
     Dan shakes her hand.
                            DR. ANTO
                Dan -- please keep me informed of
                your decision so we can monitor
                her properly -- her mental health
                is just as important as the baby --
                            DAN
                We know -- and I will.
     Dan rushes out after Catherine.
     Dr.   Anto sits back down, heavy with concern.
70   EXT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - NIGHT - PRESENT
     Tears run down Catherine's face as she throws Dan's leg
     onto the fire.
                               ANITA
                Fuck.
                               CATHERINE
                Fuck .
     They stare into the orange glow.
                            ANITA
                A little you. When's it popping
                out?
                               CATHERINE
                In 6 months.
                            ANITA
                So that's really why you called
                me.
     Bitterness consumes Catherine.
                            CATHERINE
                It could have been perfect.
     Catherine breaks.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                If he didn't l - l - lie -- if he
                wasn't such a p - per - perv --
     Anita takes her hand.
                            ANITA
                Lie down with me.
     Anita gently guides Catherine away from the fire.
71   EXT. EILDON HI LLS - DAY - 3 WEEKS AGO
     Sun bounces off the rolling landscape and hills of Eildon
     in full bloom from Scott's View.
                                                     66.
Catherine rests her head in Dan's lap as he caresses her
belly. A champagne picnic laid out before them.
Catherine's deep in thought, SIR WALTER SCOTT's 'LADY OF
THE LAKE' discarded at her side.
                      DAN
          What if it's a girl.
                      CATHERINE
          Then I'll love her forever.
Dan kisses the top of her head.
                      DAN
          What if it's a boy?
                      CATHERINE
          Then I'll love him forever!
Dan laughs and kisses her again.
                                      (CONT'D)
                         CATHERINE
          Dan?
                         DAN
          Hmmm?
                      CAT HERINE
          You're -- good. Right?
Dan hesitates.
                      DAN
          What do you mean?
                         CATHERINE
          You know.
Dan moves his hand away.       Catherine sits up.
The tension palpable.
                         DAN
          I've been --     Why are you asking
          me that?
                        CATHERINE
          Come on.    You know why.
                         DAN
          Catherine --
                      CATHERINE
          I'm just being cautious.
                      DAN
          About what, Catherine? What are
          you being cautious about?
Catherine's not giving him an inch.
                                                             67.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               Are you seriously asking me this?
               After all I went through to get --
     Catherine tries to get a solid read on Dan.
                          DAN (CONT'D)
               Wow. What a way to start a
               family.
                              CATHERINE
               I just --
                           DAN
               Would you like to check my laptop?
     Catherine pleads with her eyes for him to drop the defence.
     She just needs to hear it.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               To answer your question. I.      Am.
               Good.
                          CATHERINE
               Ok. I'm sorry. I just need to be
               sure --
     Dan feels like an idiot and takes her in his arms.
                           DAN
               I'm sorry too sweetheart. God,
               you know I love you so much. You
               just gotta trust me.
                            CATHERINE
               I do.   I really do.
72   INT. BEDROOM/ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT - 3 WEEKS AGO
     Catherine stares at the empty dark space where Dan should
     be.
     She turns away and tugs on the chain of her bedside lamp.
     Light floods the room.
     She turns toward the ENSUITE BATHROOM.
     Inside, Catherine stands in her PINK PYJAMAS over the
     toilet.
     She looks back into the bedroom.
     Only Dan is there, sleeping soundly on top of the bed.
     She empties her bottle of medicine into the toilet and
     flushes.
73   INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - 2 WEEKS AGO
     A sultry JAZZ TUNE plays from the radio.
                                                               68.
     Catherine, sporting preppy clothes, cuts meat for stew at a
     cutting board with the PINK HANDLED BUTCHERS'S KNIFE.
     She HUMS along - domestic bliss.
     O.S. A PIERCING SOUND.
     She stops.    Looks around.     Walks to the window and glances
     out.
     Nothing.
     As if it must just be the wind, Catherine returns to the
     cutting board.
     She turns up the radio, grabs her knife and returns to
     cutting meat.
74   INT. HOUSE - LOWER STAI RCASE/FOYER - NIGHT - 2 WEEKS AGO
     Catherine walks down the staircase in a PINK ROBE -
     depressed and vacant.
     Dan walks into the house carrying his LAPTOP BAG and a pile
     of school papers.
     Dan sees Catherine nearing the bottom steps, smiles and
     approaches with caution - like she's a porcelain doll.
     Catherine stares at his laptop bag.
                              DAN
                  How are you feeling?
     Catherine's lost in space.
                                 CATHERINE
                  We're alive.
                              DAN
                  Is she moving yet?
                              CATHERINE
                  We're always moving.
     Catherine eyes him with suspicion.
                              CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                  Why are you so late?
     Awkward silence.
     Dan clears his throat.
                              DAN
                  Listen Catherine, Dr. Anto --
                              CATHERINE
                  Shut the fuck up.
                              DAN
                  Catherine. Please don't -- We
                  need to keep your appointments --
                                                               69.
     Catherine switches.    Bright as sunshine.
                           CATHERINE
               How was school?
     Dan takes a deep breath.    He rubs his forehead in confusion
     and frustration.
                              DAN
               The usual.     I've got papers to
               mark.
                           CATHERINE
               Of course you do darling.
                           DAN
               I'll be in my office.
     As Dan passes Catherine on the stairs, he stops.
     He puts a hand on her belly and looks her in the eyes.
                              DAN (CONT'D)
               We're good?
                              CATHERINE
               Perfect.
     He gives her a light peck on the cheek.       She involuntarily
     cringes.
     Dan looks back over his shoulder at her as he ascends the
     stairs.
     Catherine gives him a warm smile and watches him until he's
     out of sight.
     O.S. his office door SLAMS shut, then LOCKS.
     She turns her head away in disgust and makes her way
     downstairs.
                              CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Pervert.
75   INT. HOUSE - LOWER HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - DAY - 1 WEEK AGO
     An unkempt Catherine vacuums the landin g.
     She opens the DOOR ADJACENT TO HER BEDROOM and --
     She freezes in horror.
     An explosion of WHITE FRAMES carries into --
76   INT. MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION - WHITE ROOM - DAY
     [FLASHBACK]
     -- A bright white room in a mental institution with no
     windows.
     A single twin bed with a TINY FIGURE underneath white
     sheets sits in the middle of the room.
                                                        70.
Catherine stands at the open door.     She knows exactly where
she is.
The SOUND of a CHILD's WHIMPER comes from under the sheets.
Catherine cautiously approaches the bed.
She kneels next to it.
The WHIMPER louder now.
Catherine gently pulls the sheet down, exposing --
YOUNG CATHERINE (7) in institution gown, crying.
                         CATHERINE
          Shhhhhh.
She puts her hand to YOUNG CATHERINE's forehead.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          Catherine. You 're burning up.
          Did you take your pills?
                      YOUNG CATHERINE
          You told me not to.
Catherine's confused.
                         CATHERINE
          I did?
Young Catherine let's out a deeper cry.
                         YOUNG CATHERINE
          Help me.
                         CATHERINE
          Nurse?
Catherine hurries to the door and tries to push it open.
There is no door handle --
                                     (CONT'D)
                         CATHERINE
          NURSE!
                         YOUNG CATHERINE
          Help me --
                      CATHERINE
          I'm trying! Nurse! We have a
          sick little girl in here!
Catherine pounds violen tly on the door.
                      YOUNG CATHERINE
          Catherine please!
                         CATHERINE
          HELP US!
Catherine completely breaks.
                                                            71.
                              CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Help us!     Nurse! Nurse! NURSE! --
     She turns around and moves to help YOUNG CATHERINE when --
     WHOOSH!
     The force of DEVILISH VOICES stop her dead in her tracks.
     Catherine SCREAMS --
77   EXT. HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY - 3 DAYS AGO
     Catherine, disheveled and showing major signs of
     instability, pours her medication over the GERTRUDE JEKYLL
     ROSE BUSH she planted with Dan.
     She picks up a water bucket and wa ters the bush.   Her hand
     rests protectively on her belly.
     DEVILISH VOICES seep into the atmosphere and grow around
     her.
     Catherine lets go of the water bucket.
     She tries to place the VOICES.
     Catherine rubs her stomach to protect her unborn baby.
                           CATHERINE
                   (to the air)
               I'm sorting it. Zip it!
     The VOICES stop.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               See? Mommy's here to protect you.
               Mommy will always be here.
78   INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - 3 DAYS AGO
     Catherine and Dan, elegantly dressed, beam at us from a
     silver framed PHOTO on their honeymoon in Venice as they
     hug on the Rialto Bridge.
     O.S. NEEDLE STATIC then --
     'IL MONDO' by JIMMY FONTANA floats into the bedroom.
     Catherine's bare feet pad across the carpet as she hums and
     drifts into the landing that's filled with dust.
     Her feet float up the staircase and onto --
79   INT. HOUSE - UPPER HALL WAY/LANDING - CONTINUOUS
     The upper landing that's covered in plastic.
     Her feet pass a discarded PINK BUTCHER's KNIFE and bits of
     strewn dry wall across it.
     The OIL PAINTING OF MEN FISHING sits on the ground.
                                                            72.
     O.S. a DRILL starts and a fresh cloud of DUST hits the
     morning light.
     A hole, the size of Catherine's face, has been cut into the
     wall.
     Catherine stands on a foot stool in the SAME DRESS from the
     photo and drills a pinhole inside the large hole.
     A cacophony of DEVILISH VOICES seep in and cut through the
     music and over the drill.
     Catherine stops drilling and listens.
     The VOICES build over the MUSIC.
                           CAT HERINE
                   (to self)
               Hurry your lezza-ass up, Anita.
     She starts the drill and resumes her task in spite of the
     voices.
     As the VOICES crescendo, Catherine stops and blows excess
     dust from the tiny hole revealing a peep into Dan's office.
     Catherine's face is hard to read as she slowly puts her eye
     to it.
     The DEVILISH VOICES climax and --
80   INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - LAST NIGHT - [FLASHBACK]
     Catherine's hand g rips the door handle and slowly pushes
     into Dan's office.
     Dan sits on the ground in his boxers and T-Shirt.
     He's holding YOUNG CATHERINE in PINK PYJAMAS.
     They laugh and innocently tickle each other as Dan sings --
                           DAN
               The itsy-bitsy spider crawled up
               the water spout. Down came the
               rain --
     Dan and Young Catherine see Catherine.
                           DAN (CONT'D)
               Look, there's Catherine.
               Catherine!
                           YOUNG CATHERINE
               Hey, Catherine!
                            DAN
               He y, Catherine!
     They both wave and smile at Catherine. "Hey Catherine"
     repeats and REVERBS around the room as they morph into a a
     blurred haze-trip.
                                                              73.
     Their VOICES reach an apex then --
     Dan is at his desk in boxers and T-Shirt, typing on his
     laptop. Young Catherine is gone.
     Over Dan's shoulder, Catherine's silhouette appears in the
     doorway. One arm behind her back. Her demeanour off -
     like she's possessed.
     Catherine practically floats towards Dan.
     As she gets closer, the laptop glow illuminates her
     deranged eyes.
     Dan catches her reflection on his screen.
     He rips off his headphones and turns, horrified --
                            DAN (CONT'D)
               Catherine!   It's not what you --
     Catherine lets out an almighty, feral SCREAM.
     She whips out her hidden arm, raises it and slams down a
     PINK HANDLED BUTCHERS'S KNIFE right into Dan's right
     temporal lobe.
     Her SCREAM reverbs eerily throughout the house and into the
     night -
     THE VOICES explode into SILENCE.
81   INT. HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - NIGHT - PRE SENT
     NOCTURNAL SOUNDS echo across the peaceful garden setting.
     Catherine and Anita lay side by side on pushed-together
     wicker lounge chairs.
     Catherine holds her belly protectively.
     Anita holds her other hand tight.
     They stare at the stars and fight back tears.
                           CATHERINE
               I've gone and gotten ourselves
               into another mess, haven't I?
     Catherine lets the tears flow.   Then --
     FULL PANIC ATTACK.
     Catherine stan ds, hyperventilates.
     She slaps her face and rubs her eyes.      She paces.   She
     slaps herself again. Harder.
                           CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                   (like a mantra)
               You're not a victim. You're not a
               victim. You're not a victim.
                                                          74.
     Anita stands, reaches for her and accidentally touches the
     back of Catherine's NECK.
     Catherine jumps out of her skin and fumes. All the pain,
     hurt, frustration and loss of what she's strived to achieve
     hits her hard.
     Anita's presence finally a stark reminder that she's not
     well, Catherine blasts her with an almighty feral scream
     and charges towards the house.
     Anita follows.
                            CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                   (to self)
               You'r e not a victim. You're not a
               vict --
                           ANITA
               It's okay to be -
                           CATHERINE
               It is NOT okay to be a victim!
                              ANITA
               It's --
                           CATHERINE
               It's NOT! Victim-hood is simply
               an excuse for a lack of personal
               progress!
     Anita stops.     Catherine charges on.
                           ANITA
               Where are you going?
                           CATHERINE
               To find ZEBRA GIRL!
82   INT. HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
     Catherine bounds up the staircase with purpose.
83   INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
     Catherine barges into the bedroom and heads straight for a
     small drawer.
     Anita arrives at the doorway out of breath.
                           ANITA
               So you did finish it!
                           CATHERINE
               And with a happy fucking ending!
     She rips open the drawer.
     She feels around the back and pulls out a PINK LOCK BOX.
     She places it on the bed.
                                                     75.
She grabs her large jewellery box from the nightstand and
dumps the jewellery onto the bed.
She pokes through the tangled mess.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          The hell is it!?
              (picks out key))
          Got it!
After a few attempts, she finally opens the box.
Nestled inside sits an old school work book titled: 'ZEBRA
GIRL'.
Catherine pulls out ZEBRA GIRL and flips through it with
urgency.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I'll show you. I'm not a victim,
          A nita. The Prince accepts Zebra
          Girl and they live happily ever
          after --
Catherine gets to the end of the book.
Her face drops - mortified.
                                    (CONT'D)
                        CATHERINE
          No --
                        ANITA
          What is it?
The book drops to the floor.
A LOW FERAL NOISE escapes Catherine.
Her hands fly to her head and she squeezes it in
desperation.
Anita drops to the floor and opens the book at the end.
On the last page of the book there's a drawing of Dan as
'The Prince' sitting in front of his laptop at the desk -
hand on crotch. Catherine as 'Zebra Girl' looms behind
him. The PINK BUTCHER's KNIFE poised to kill.
Anita reads the last words out loud.
                      ANITA (CONT'D)
          "For as she had always known, a
          Zebra is simply just a painted
          horse. Sometimes you buck the
          horse. Sometimes the horse bucks
          you. The End."
Anita looks up to Catherine.
                      ANITA (CONT'D)
          The bloody hell does that even
          mean?
                                                                 76.
                             CATHERINE
                 I'll show you what it means!
     Catherine storms past Anita.
84   INT. HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
     Catherine charges up the staircase and into --
85   INT. HOUSE - DAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     -- The moonlit office.
     She rushes to Dan's laptop and opens it.         The glow lights
     her face.
     Anita appears in the doorway out of breath.
                             CATHERINE
                 It MEANS that I knew all along
                 this perverted bastard was never
                 going to --
     Catherin e's eyes widen in shock.
     She scrolls through Dan's history.
                                           (CONT'D)
                               CATHERINE
                 To -- to --
     She scrolls faster.
     Shakes her head.
     Eyes scanning like a maniac.
                                           (CONT'D)
                             CATHERINE
                 No, no, no, no --
     As Catherine scrolls, Dan's HISTORY ON SCREEN READS:
     - WATER THERAPY FOR THE MIND
     - ART THERAPY FOR THE MIND
     - ANTIPSYCHOTIC VITAMINS?
     - SIDE EFFECTS WHEN STOPPING ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION
     Tears sting her eyes.
                                           (CONT'D)
                               CATHERINE
                 No, no --
     She keeps scrolling.      Then --
     Big GASP.   Eyes wide.
     Her hand shakes with trepidation as she CLICKS on something
     unseen.
     Catherine can't breathe.
                                                            77.
     Tears stream down her red face.
     Over Catherine's shoulder the fluffy tops of BABY HEADS can
     be seen.
     Anita approaches --
                           ANITA
               What is it --
     As Anita approaches Catherine from behind, the obscured
     IMAGES on the screen come into view.
                            ANITA (CONT'D)
               Oh shit --
     Over Catherine's shoulder, the IMAGES on the screen are
     crystal clear as Catherine clicks through them like a
     zombie:
     - HAPPY BABIES MODEL BABY CLOTHES, SOM E CLADE IN PINK ZEBRA
     PRINTS.
     - BABY TOYS
     - BABY MONITORS
     And lastly --
     - A BIG BEAUTIFUL BABY MOBILE WITH CRYSTAL TEAR DROPS AND
     LITTLE PINK ZEBRAS FLOATING IN THE AIR.
     Catherine steps back in horror.
                            CATHERINE
               No --
     She holds her belly and SCREAMS in anguish.
     Anita tries to hug her.
     Catherine violently shrugs her off and runs out of the
     office --
                            ANITA
               Catherine!
86   INT. HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
     Catherine des cends the spiral staircase in a state of utter
     insanity.
     Anita appears at the top.
                           ANITA
               Catherine, wait! --
87   INT. HOUSE - LOWER STAIRCASE/LANDING/BEDROOM - NIGHT
     Catherine stands in front of the CLOSED ADJACENT DOOR to
     her OPEN BEDROOM DOOR.
                                                       78.
Eyes glazed with shock, she's terrified of what lies
beyond.
She grips the door handle and gently pushes the door open.
Catherine cautiously makes her way in.
O.S. her FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH on PLASTIC.
Moonlight shimmers off PLASTIC COVERED FURNISHINGS.
She looks to the floor.
Small GASP.
A pile of debris shimmers in a heap by her feet.
She leans over in the dark and pulls on a cord.
The room is suddenly awash in a DUSTY PINK hue. ZEBRA
SHADOWS dance on the walls that emanate from a large
rotating BABY LAMP.
The walls have different coloured paint patches.
It's an UNFINISHED BABY's ROOM.
On the floor at Catherine's feet lies the SAME BABY MOBILE
seen on Dan's laptop, crashed in a heap on the floor. The
PINK SHOPPING BAG discarded beside it.
Anita's FEET appear next to Catherine.
As she reaches for Catheri ne's hand, we see that Catherine
is holding the BLOODIED BUTCHERS KNIFE.
Catherine's face crumples in anguish.
O.S. distant POLICE SIRENS cut through the eerie silence.
Catherine turns to Anita - eyes wild.
                      CATHERINE
          Please tell me you didn't darling -
          -
She grabs Anita violently by her leather jacket and puts
the KNIFE to her throat.
Anita doesn't resist.
                       CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          What the fuck did you do? You
          know wha t'll happen -- I'll be
          pilled to the ceiling! Alone
          until death. Why would you call
          the police!?
                      ANITA
          Because -- you're not alone
          anymore Catherine.
Catherine takes this in.
                                                         79.
The SIRENS LOUDER now.
                      ANITA (CONT'D)
          Tick-tock darling.
Anita puts her hand on the knife and gently guides it away
from her.
Catherine gives in and drops the knife.
She sits on the floor against the wall.
Anita sits beside her.
Catherine's head falls into Anita's lap.
She wraps her arms protectively around her belly.
An eerie sense of calm.
Anita strokes Catherine's hair.
                      CATHERINE
          We were so happy. I felt s o
          secure. I thought I could -- I
          just wanted a healthy baby.
Catherine breaks.   Tears roll down her cheeks.
O.S. POLICE CARS SCREECH to a halt outside and the baby's
room is hit with flashing RED and BLUE lights.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I guess I'm one of nature's
          mistakes.
Anita gives Catherine a gentle kiss on the cheek.
O.S. the SOUND of OFFICERS approaching the front door.
                       FEMALE OFFICER
          One, two, three!
BOO M!
O.S. the front door SMASHES open and POLICE are HEARD
rushing into the house and up the staircase.
                      ANITA
          You ain't no mistake.
O.S. POLICE FOOTSTEPS on the stairs get closer and closer --
                      ANITA (CONT'D)
          You're Zebra Girl.
Catherine smiles and puts her forehead against Anita's.
                      CATHERINE
          I'm gonna miss you.
The door cautiously opens and A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER
stands at the door with her GUN pointed at CATHER INE.
                                                        80.
Anita is GONE.
Catherine sits on the floor against the wall amongst all
the debris. Her arms wrapped around her belly. A small
cut bleeds near her throat.
The BLOODIED PINK BUTCHER'S KNIFE sticks out of the floor
between her feet.
Catherine looks up and smiles at the Officer as if looking
for understanding and forgiveness.
She looks down at her belly and back up to the Officer.
                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I'm not alone.
The Officer connects the dots.
She lowers her gun and speaks into her radio.
                      FEMALE OFFICER
          I have a Pregnant Female, 30s -
Catherine smiles and the Officer's VOICE fades as we float
out of the room --
Into the BLOODIED BATHROOM and --
Down the SPIRAL STAIRCASE passing an ascending FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER into --
The KITCHEN past a FULL UNTOUCHED BOTTLE OF WHISKY and
CLEAN TEA CUP and out the open door into the --
BACK GARDEN, past the PUSHED TOGETHER wicker lounge chairs
with ANITA's SUNGLASSES, UNOPENED PACK OF CIGARETTES and
RED LEATHER JACKET laid out like a body and PANNING ONTO --
The DRUM at the end of the garden SPEWING FIRE with DAN's
BAGGED REMAINS beside it and OVER TO --
The JULIET ROSE BUSH in FULL BLOOM and down to Catherine's
PILLS scattered at the base, the discarded WATER CAN beside
them.




                      THE END
