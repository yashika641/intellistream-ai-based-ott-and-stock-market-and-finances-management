                                                  OVER BLACK:

    Do not fear those who kill the body but can not kill the
    soul.

                                                 -Matthew, 10:28

    FADE IN:


1   EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                   1

    A beat-up sedan rolls along an isolated rural road.

    The back of the sedan has a faded US MARINES bumper sticker.

    The road is otherwise empty.


2   INT. SIMON'S CAR - DAY                                        2

    SIMON (late 20s) drives.

    He has a melancholy, almost dark air to him. Like he's still
    chewing over a bad decision. He looks tired and groggy.

    He smokes a cigarette. Several empty packs decorate the
    passenger seat.

    There's a sweaty blues track on the radio. Simon turns it up,
    louder than he really needs to.

    He slightly turns the wheel until his car is now straddling
    the center line.

    He swerves side to side slowly, barely looking up to notice
    oncoming vehicles.

    He finally recovers control, getting the car back into the
    proper lane. He lights another cigarette.

    He stays silent for awhile and looks disappointed.


3   EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                   3

    An SUV turns off a tiny dirt side road a ways back from
    Simon. It accelerates behind him.


4   INT. SIMON'S CAR - DAY                                        4

    Simon glances in the rearview, sees the SUV gaining on him
    rapidly.
                                                                 2.


5    EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                      5

     Up ahead, a VAN wheels out from a dirt path. It turns towards
     Simon, also moving oddly fast for this road.


6    INT. SIMON'S CAR - DAY                                           6

     Simon grips the wheel tightly. Glances in the rearview again.
     That SUV is getting close.


7    EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                      7

     The VAN SWERVES across the road and brakes, blocking Simon's
     path.


8    INT. SIMON'S CAR - DAY                                           8

     Simon simply reacts, shifting into reverse.


9    EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                      9

     But the SUV behind him similarly turns and blocks his
     retreat.

     DALE (20s), all wiry energy, gets out of the van and points a
     gun at Simon.

     MAROK (late 30s), the tough man in charge, does the same.


10   INT. SIMON'S CAR - DAY                                       10

     Simon sees he's cornered and reluctantly puts his hands up.


11   EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                  11

     Dale advances to the door.

                         DALE
               Get the fuck out of the car!

     Simon hesitates.

                         SIMON
               I don't have any money, you can
               have the car.

     Dale chuckles at Simon.
                                                                 3.


                         DALE
               I don't want your piece of shit
               car. Now get out!

     Simon gets out.

     Dale leads Simon to the back of the van, searches him and
     takes his cell phone, then opens the double back door.

     There are already five other guys in there, huddled at the
     far end.

     Dale holds his gun up to them.

                         DALE (CONT'D)
               Stay the fuck back.

     Then he turns to Simon.

                         DALE (CONT'D)
               Get in.

     Simon gives Dale a look that says "no way".

     Dale PISTOL WHIPS Simon and KICKS him in the stomach. Simon
     keels over and the two assailants SHOVE him into the van and
     CLOSE the door behind him.


12   EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - DAY                                  12

     The van and SUV take off. The entire operation has taken less
     than two minutes.


13   INT. VAN - DAY                                               13

     Simon rises up still in pain. He tries to un-hatch the back
     door but it is locked from the outside. Giving up, he turns
     and looks at the other men in the van. They are:

     WAYNE (late 20s) - he's got enough tattoos and scars that
     it'd be fair to assume he's some sort of gang member or ex-
     con. And you'd be right.

     ERIC (late 20s) - a squirrelly thin guy who looks like he
     should be providing IT support but still makes it to the gym
     a couple times a week.

     ROB (late 20s) - clean cut and dressed a bit nicer than the
     rest. Seems like he's trying to sit in a dignified way,
     ridiculously.
                                                         4.


SEAN (late 30s) - a kind, timid, mild-mannered man,
incredibly scared.

DENNY (late 20s) - the most athletic of the group. Also the
quietest.

Sean whimpers in pain to the side.

A tense beat between them. Then:

                    SIMON
          What's going on?

                    ERIC
          None of us know.

                    WAYNE
          These mother fuckers are dead.
          That's what I know.

Simon glances around the interior of the van, trying to get
any clue he can.

                    SIMON
          How long have you been in here?

                    ERIC
          I was the first. That was a long
          time ago.

                       SIMON
          How long?

                    ERIC
          What time is it now?

                    SIMON
          Around three.

                     ERIC
          I was headed to work. That was nine
          hours ago.

Simon looks towards the front. The van is built such that a
wall separates them from the driver section.

He lowers his voice.

                    SIMON
          You're just sitting here?

                    ERIC
          I'd rather sit here than get shot.
                                                         5.


Simon balances himself and kicks the back door as hard as he
can.

Denny chimes in.

                    DENNY
          I wouldn't do that.

                     SIMON
          Why?

                    DENNY
          Because you're going to get us all
          killed.

                    SIMON
          They obviously want us alive or
          else they would've just shot you
          all already.

                    ROB
          Thanks for the update.

He looks around at the group.

                    SIMON
          Have you tried rushing at them when
          they open the door?

                     WAYNE
          No.

Wayne says no almost as a question. Excited at Simon's spirit
for escape.

                     SIMON
          Why not?

                    WAYNE
          Because it's me and four females in
          here.

                    ERIC
          Just because they haven't used
          their guns doesn't mean they won't.

Simon looks at Wayne.

                    SIMON
          You and me then.

Rob pipes in from his spot brooding in the corner.
                                                         6.


                    ROB
          Plenty of hostage situations are
          resolved without the hostages
          dying.

                    SIMON
          I've got seventeen dollars in my
          checking account.

He glances from Rob to Wayne and Eric.

                    ERIC
          I've got a couple grand saved up,
          but it's not like I'm rich.

Wayne doesn't say anything.

                    SIMON
          So, it's not about money.
              (to Wayne)
          Any reason someone would have it
          out for you?

                     WAYNE
          Plenty of fools have it out for me.
          But none of them are smart enough
          to do it like this. And if they
          were, they'd a killed my ass by
          now. Not left me in the back of a
          van with a bunch of strangers...
          I'm with you, let's hit em' on the
          next stop.

                    SIMON
          Next stop...

Simon's heard enough, he turns and kicks the back door with
his heel again. This time harder and repeatedly. Denny looks
as if he wants to take action against Simon, but he doesn't.

The van comes to an abrupt STOP, causing the men to tumble
around like rag dolls.

The back door opens before they have a chance to recover and
rush it. What little they can see suggests they've pulled off
road and into the woods along a dirt path.

Dale and Marok stand there, guns in hand.

                    DALE
              (to Denny)
          You. Come here.

Denny is reluctant.
                                                         7.


                       DENNY
          Me?

                       DALE
          Out.

                    DENNY
          It wasn't me! I was just sitting
          here!

                    MAROK
          Then you can blame them.

Marok cocks his gun.

Denny slowly makes his way to Dale and Marok. Marok roughly
pulls him out of the van.

They SLAM the back door closed.

The men exchange looks. They can hear Denny, Dale and Marok
moving besides the van.

                       DENNY (O.S.)
          No-

BAM!

The men hear Denny's body hit the ground.

Sean CRIES out in shock.

The others simply stay silent. The back door opens.

Dale and Marok again.

                    MAROK
          This is what you need to
          understand. We are smarter than
          you. We are stronger than you. We
          are better than you. There is
          nothing, absolutely nothing, you
          can think of or try that will
          change what will happen tonight. So
          stop.

They SLAM the door shut again.

A few moments later the van continues on. Sean crawls to the
corner and VOMITS.

The others are so shell-shocked they barely react.
                                                                8.


14   EXT. VAN - NIGHT                                            14

     The van continues, day has bled into night.


15   INT. VAN - NIGHT                                            15

     Silence. Sean's puke slides around the floor of the van.

                         ROB
               There must be some common factor
               amongst us.
                   (to Eric)
               What do you do for a living?

                         ERIC
               I'm in sales. Timeshares.

                         WAYNE
               Reason enough to kill you right
               there.

                         ROB
               I'm guessing you earn your money a
               little differently.

                         WAYNE
               Look down your nose at me again,
               and I'll break it off.

                         SIMON
               Easy. Do you have a nine to five?

                         WAYNE
               I work in a warehouse.

                         SIMON
                   (to Rob)
               And you?

                         ROB
               I work for my father.

     Wayne looks at Rob's clothes.

                         WAYNE
               Is your father Bill Gates?

                         ROB
               We're well off, okay? But that
               still doesn't explain why they took
               you all.
                                                              9.


                          SIMON
                    (To Sean)
                How about you?

     Sean, miserable to the side, looks up.

                          SEAN
                I teach kids. Elementary school.

     Silence.

                          ERIC
                    (to Simon)
                And you?

     Simon falls back to sit. A delay, then:

                          SIMON
                I'm between jobs.

                          ERIC
                What do your parents do?

                          SIMON
                My mother's dead. My father's a
                retired Marine.

                          ERIC
                Wish he was here.

     Simon doesn't respond:


16   INT. CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)                                16

     Simon sits next to an older man who is SIMON'S FATHER.

                          SIMON'S FATHER
                You're sure?

                          SIMON
                Yes.

                          SIMON'S FATHER
                You can't do it for me, or for your
                grandfather. It has to be for you
                or it won't mean anything.

                          SIMON
                I know.
                                                             10.


17   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY (FLASHBACK)               17

     A number of RECRUITS stand in front of a large tree log. One
     of them is Simon.

     They are across from STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (40s).

     Staff Sergeant Raynor does not suffer fools. Nor does he
     enjoy causing men pain. He simply does what needs to be done.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Recruits! Today is not going to be
               fun. Tomorrow is not going to be
               fun. If you are somehow able to
               complete your training and gain
               entry into my Marine Corps, most of
               the days of the remainder of your
               lives will not be fun. But that's
               why we are who we are. That's what
               separates us. We have the strength
               to do what other men cannot. We do.
               I'm not sure if YOU do.

     He looks over the faces of the men.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Our activities out here will not
               end soon. There will be the bare
               minimum of down time. If you injure
               yourself, do not act like a big
               hard sumbitch, because you surely
               are not one. Inform me immediately.
               Is that understood?

                         RECRUITS
               Yes, Staff Sergeant!

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Good. Let's get going. Hoo-ah.

                         RECRUITS
               Hoo-ah!

     Staff Sergeant Raynor gestures towards the log in front of
     the recruits.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               When I say "lift" you will, as a
               group, raise the log in front of
               you to chest level. When I say
               "press" you will raise it above
               your heads.
                         (MORE)
                                                             11.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               When I say "march" you will perform
               a circular march, twenty paces to
               the left, then turning ninety
               degrees and repeating until you
               return to your starting point. Is
               that understood?

                         RECRUITS
               Yes, Staff Sergeant!

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Lift!

     Simon and the others bend down and raise the mammoth log.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Press!

     With difficulty the men manage to get the log above their
     heads. Various men GRUNT and CURSE in doing so.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               March!

     The men slowly move to the left with the log. RECRUIT 2491
     behind Simon mumbles under his breath.

                         RECRUIT 2491
               Last time I checked Marines didn't
               spend a lot of time carrying logs.

     Simon simply grimaces and keeps moving.

                                                 END FLASHBACK:


18   INT. VAN - NIGHT                                             18

     The men sit in silence in the van.

                         ERIC
                   (to Wayne)
               Are you in a gang or something?

     Wayne simply glares at Eric.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
               I'm asking because I'm wondering if
               you've ever heard of anything like
               this.
                                                        12.


                    WAYNE
          Kidnapping a bunch of complete
          strangers for no reason? No, I've
          never heard of anything like this.

Silence again.

                    SEAN
          They're going to cut us up and eat
          us, aren't they? I read an article
          about cannibalism in America. It
          said-

                       SIMON
          Quiet.

Sean shuts up.

                    SEAN
          They'll probably kill us either
          way.

                    ERIC
          If they were doing this just to
          murder us why take such a long time
          to do it?

                    WAYNE
          They want to take us someplace
          where they can enjoy it.

This strikes a dark chord with the group.

LATER

All the men have stopped talking and sit in silent anger.

The van abruptly STOPS.

The back doors open.

Standing there are Dale, Marok and... Denny. Denny is holding
a handgun too now.

                    WAYNE (CONT'D)
          ...the fuck?

                    DALE
          Out of my van, ladies.

The men slowly file out of the van. They're in the middle of
nowhere, the end of a dirt road deep in the woods.
                                                             13.


                          MAROK
                Line up next to each other.

     They do.

     Denny addresses the men, now speaking with a confidence he
     didn't have before. He winks.

                          DENNY
                I missed you guys too.

     Denny chuckles.

                          MAROK
                In case you didn't believe me
                earlier, we are in control of this
                situation. You are not. The best
                chance for you to get through this
                is to simply follow instructions.

     And then, out of nowhere... Simon runs for it.

     Dale is closest to him and raises his gun.

                            DALE
                Stop!

                            DENNY
                Don't.

     Dale lowers his gun.

                            DALE
                Shit.

     Marok takes off after Simon.

     Dale steps closer to the group and puts his gun to Wayne's
     head.

                          DALE (CONT'D)
                Next one tries that gets shot in
                the fuckin' head.


19   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                           19

     Simon sprints through the woods. He doesn't dare look back.

     The steps of Marok can be heard coming behind him.

     Up ahead in the distance he can see a clearing. Several cars,
     including his own, are parked there.
                                                              14.


     He moves in that direction.


20   EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT                                20

     Simon emerges from the trees into the clearing.

     His car is RIGHT there... so close...

     BAM!

     Simon is clothes-lined by PLEBE GREEN (20s), a fit young man
     who could just as easily have been one of the recruits from
     Simon's Marine class.

     Simon hits the dirt hard.

     They wrestle on the ground, Simon manages to push Plebe Green
     off. He rises...

     WHAP!

     ...Only to get BASHED in the head with a large branch.

     Simon drops, comatose, revealing Marok.

     Marok drops the branch.

                         PLEBE GREEN
               Who's this?

                         MAROK
               He's part of the ceremony. What are
               you doing out here?

                         PLEBE GREEN
               Just having a smoke.

                         MAROK
               Break time's over.

     He gestures to Simon.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               Help me get him inside.


21   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                           21

     Simon comes in and out of consciousness as Marok and Plebe
     Green carry him.
                                                                15.


22   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           22

     Plebe Green and Marok carry him inside.

     From what little he can see when his eyes blink open between
     moments of unconsciousness, it looks fairly normal, like an
     average person's house.


23   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                23

     Simon enters a bare room with brick walls and a concrete
     floor.

     Simon is practically thrown into a cage, where Wayne, Sean,
     Rob and Eric already reside.

     The door is locked behind him.

     The basement itself is almost totally bare.

     Marok and Plebe Green head upstairs and close the door behind
     them.

     Simon is shaken out of his stupor by Wayne.

                         WAYNE
               You get your ass kicked?

     Simon doesn't respond, winces in pain as he stands up.

                         WAYNE (CONT'D)
               How far'd you get?

                         SIMON
               Not far enough.

     Simon looks to the other men.

                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               I saw my car, there was a few of
               them.

                          ROB
               Where?

                         SIMON
               They're close.

                         WAYNE
               Could you find them again?
                                                        16.


                    SIMON
          Where are we in relation to the
          van?

                    WAYNE
          They blindfolded us.

                    SIMON
          Do you remember the direction you
          walked?

                    WAYNE
          Maybe.

                    SIMON
          If I can get to where the van was I
          can find our cars.

                    WAYNE
          I've got a gun in my glove
          compartment.

                    SIMON
          What kind of car?

                    WAYNE
          Black pick up.

                     SIMON
          What do you remember about the walk
          over here?

                    WAYNE
          Straight line more or less, west
          from the van. I'd say two hundred
          yards or so if I had to.

They are shut up by the sound of the door to the basement
opening.

Denny enters with Marok.

Marok focuses on Simon.

                    MAROK
              (to Simon)
          I hope you learned something.

                    SIMON
          I did, you swing like a girl.

Marok laughs.
                                                         17.


                    MAROK
          You're going to have a fun night..

The captives are confused. Denny gestures to everyone.

                    DENNY
          Wallets. IDs. Watches.

The men are reluctant to comply.

                    MAROK
          That was not a yes or no question.
          Give them up.

The men finally acquiesce.

                    ERIC
          Who are you guys? Seriously? Some
          sort of cult?

                    DENNY
          Who we are is not for you to know.

                    SIMON
          You're nothing but a bunch of crazy
          people with a house and a van.
          We're real impressed.

                    DENNY
          You're not important enough to
          deserve impressing. The only reason
          you're not face down in a ditch
          right now is that I didn't feel
          like expending the effort to catch
          another one of you.

Marok meets Simon's gaze. He almost smiles.

                    MAROK
          You want to know who we are? In
          ancient Rome they used to flood the
          colosseum and reenact famous naval
          battles. Hundreds would die in the
          performance.

He takes a step closer.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          Most people, even today, are either
          dying, or watching the show...
          We're the ones who decide who goes
          on the boat.

Denny collects the wallets and other personal items.
                                                    18.


                    DENNY
          Don't worry, we'll be back soon.

He exits with Marok.

Wayne looks at Simon.

                    WAYNE
          They know who we are now. Even if
          we could escape, they'd have a much
          better chance to track us down.

Simon looks around the barren room.

                    SEAN
          I'm telling you, they're gonna
          fucking eat us.

                    WAYNE
          If you don't shut up I'm gonna
          fucking eat you.

Sean does shut up now.

                    ROB
          They held those Americans in Iran
          hostage for 444 days. They all made
          it home.

                    ERIC
          You weren't listening. These guys
          aren't some group of terrorists.

                    ROB
          What are you suggesting?

                    ERIC
          Skull & Bones. Illuminati.

                    WAYNE
          The shot-callers in the back room
          smoking cigars.

                    ROB
          Smoke and mirrors, I don't believe
          these punks are connected to anyone
          with real power.

Simon notices a spot of dried blood on the floor.

                    SIMON
          Nah, these are probably just the
          guys that do their dirty work.
                                                             19.


24   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                               24

     Marok sits behind an ornate desk in a well-appointed office.
     Dale and Denny stand across from him.

                         MAROK
               Let's pair the runner with Plebe
               Gold.

                         DALE
               Serves the son of a bitch right.

     Dale grins.


25   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM - NIGHT                        25

     Five men are lined up side by side.

     They are blindfolded.

     A long table is set up in front of them. On it is a dossier,
     marked Plebe Green, Plebe Gold, etc. All different colors for
     each man.

     Marok and Dale stand in front of the men.

                         MAROK
               Very few men have stood where you
               stand today. Few are chosen, and
               even fewer pass the test. You have
               a chance to do both tonight. After
               this last challenge - if you
               succeed - you will have crossed the
               final threshold. Remember that
               every one of us has gone through
               what we're asking you to go
               through.

     He looks over the men.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               We don't want simply the biggest
               man or the strongest man. Because a
               big man or a strong man can fail.
               But a man of will can never truly
               be defeated.


26   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                             26

     The men look edgy, desperate.
                                                             20.


                         ROB
               Maybe I can bribe them.

                         SEAN
               That's a good idea.

                         WAYNE
               They don't care about money.

                         SIMON
               How do you know?

     Wayne pulls out a wad of bills from one pocket and some loose
     change from the other.

                         WAYNE
               There's a big difference between
               someone who's hard and someone
               who's just plain crazy.


27   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM - NIGHT                          27

     Marok lights a cigarette.

                         MAROK
               Trust. Trust is a critical part of
               what we do. You must trust your
               fellow member as you trust
               yourself.

     He steps forward to PLEBE GOLD - who looks like he could
     probably pick Marok up and eat him, so muscular and powerful
     is his frame.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               Plebe Gold. Do you trust me?

                           PLEBE GOLD
               Yes, sir.

                         MAROK
               Hold out your hand.

     Plebe Gold does.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
28             Do not make a sound.                              28

     Marok extinguishes the cigarette in Plebe Gold's hand, he
     winces in pain but doesn't cry out.

     Marok holds court in front of the recruits.
                                                        21.


                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          Remove your blindfolds.

The men do. In front of each of them is a small black
notebook laying on top of a manila folder. The books have an
emblem engraved as well as a COLOR, respectively of the five
Plebes.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          Before each of you, you will find
          your Member's Code. This book
          defines what it means to be a
          brother in this organization. On
          the back page, you will find your
          funded membership benefit card,
          which will become active as of the
          end of your initiation, if you pass
          your final test.

The men flip through the notebook, see the BLACK card on the
back.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          Now, open the folder in front of
          you.

All the men flip open the folders on the table in front of
them. In it are photos of the captives (a variety of photos,
the kind you might find on Facebook) along with copies of
their driver licenses.

The sound of someone screaming is heard.

                    ROB (O.S.)
          Guard!

The cry is barely audible in the room.

Marok smolders.

He turns to Dale and gestures for him to go.

IN THE BACK

Two Plebes, PLEBE SILVER and PLEBE ORANGE, watch.

                    PLEBE ORANGE
          I thought there'd be masks and
          robes.

                    PLEBE SILVER
          You don't get your diploma on final
          exam day, we gotta get initiated
          first.
                                                           22.


                         PLEBE ORANGE
               Whatever that means.

                         PLEBE SILVER
               Whatever it is, it'll be worth it.


28   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                           28

     Dale descends the steps and approaches the men.

                         DALE
               This isn't a Holiday Inn. We're not
               taking room service requests.

     Everyone looks to Rob, but he's reluctant to speak.

     Simon nudges him.

                         SIMON
                   (whispers)
               Tell him.

     Rob doesn't.

                         DALE
               Sometime this week.

                         SIMON
               We can make you a deal.

                         DALE
               No, you can't.

     Dale turns to leave.

                         ROB
               Five million dollars.

     Dale stops.

                         DALE
               And why should I believe you have
               that kind of money?

                          ROB
               You took our IDs. You know my name.
               Anyone with a computer and access
               to the internet would know I have
               access to that kind of money. I can
               have that amount in cash here in a
               few hours.
                                                23.


                    DALE
          And what is five millions dollars
          worth to someone like you? A human
          life?

                    ROB
          I just want to go home. No one will
          come looking for you. You have my
          word.

                    DALE
          Five million. You know, I think
          five million each makes sense.

                    ROB
          That's too much.

                     DALE
          Oh well.

                    ROB
          I... What about ten million? For
          all of us. That's the best I can
          do.

                    DALE
          Nah. You guys sit tight. And don't
          fucking yell again.

Dale heads off.

                    ROB
          Ten million cash and only I have to
          leave.

The others react to this with dirty looks.

Dale turns back.

                    DALE
          You'll leave these poor bastards to
          die, and never tell anyone? For the
          rest of your life?

                     ROB
          Yes.

                    DALE
          You'll live another fifty years,
          knowing you let all these innocent
          men die just to save yourself?

                     ROB
          ...yes.
                                                             24.


                         DALE
               I like you, Rob. You make me
               remember why I do this.

     Dale heads upstairs.

                         ROB
                   (in disbelief, to himself)
               No...

     The others don't say anything to Rob. They don't need to. He
     won't even look at them.


29   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM                                29

     The plebes look confused, shocked, and speechless.

                         MAROK
               You do this voluntarily or not at
               all. Any man who does not wish to
               proceed, step back immediately.

     No one steps back.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               Let's begin.


30   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                             30

     Marok, Dale and Denny lead the recruits into the basement.
     The various recruits show particular interest in the man they
     are paired against, noticeably Plebe Gold stares down Simon.

     Simon meets his gaze.

     Plebe Gold gives him a gruff "nod", like they're two inmates
     sizing each other up.

     Denny takes Dale aside.

                         DENNY
                   (re: the captives)
               They look terrified.

                         DALE
               The rich kid offered me ten million
               bucks. They're scared shitless.

                         DENNY
               We're responsible for running this
               properly - let's get them ready.
                                                        25.


Dale heads over to...

THE CAGE

                     DALE
           Listen up. You're in the middle of
           fucking nowhere, as I'm sure this
           Kenyan-runner-asshole...

He gestures to Simon.

                     DALE (CONT'D)
           ...can tell you. There's a reason
           we haven't lit your cars on fire.

Dale points to Denny, who picks up a burlap sack from the
corner and removes a number of car keys, JINGLES them.

                     DALE (CONT'D)
           Each of you will be fighting one of
           them. Win your fight, win your
           freedom. Lose, you die. It's very
           simple.

                     WAYNE
           No way.

                     DALE
           Believe it.

                     SEAN
           What?

                     DALE
           Am I speaking fucking Chinese? The
           fight will continue until someone
           is dead. If it's not you, you can
           walk out that door.

Wayne scoffs.

                     DALE (CONT'D)
           Yes?

                     WAYNE
           You couldn't take the chance we'd
           rat you out to the cops.

                     DALE
           Who says that some of our members
           aren't cops?

Silence from the men.
                                                           26.


                    DALE (CONT'D)
          The home you're in belongs to an
          influential man. Not just rich, but
          powerful and respected. The kind of
          guy where, if it's his word against
          yours, he wins.

No one wants to argue against being let go.

                    DALE (CONT'D)
          Rob is first.

                    SIMON
          What if we say no?

                    DALE
          Then it'll be a short fight.

Rob looks terrified.

Denny waves to him and takes the burlap sack upstairs.

ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM

The plebes stand, silent. Only one of them, PLEBE GREEN,
seems antsy.

                    PLEBE GREEN
          Why am I going first?

Plebe Gold gives him a look of disdain.

                    PLEBE GOLD
          You got this, man up.

Marok steps into the center of the room.

                     MAROK
          Plebe Green, on me. Form a circle
          around us.

Plebe Green steps forward, hesitant. The other Plebes
encircle him and Marok.

Marok leans close to the visibly nervous Plebe Green.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
              (whispers)
          This is how you're supposed to
          feel. Throw the first punch and
          it'll go away. Understand?
                                                                27.


                         PLEBE GREEN
                   (insincere)
               Yes, sir.

     Marok looks over to the cage. He gestures to Dale to open it.

     Dale steps over, gun in hand, and opens the cage door.

     He drags Rob out and practically throws him into the center
     of the room.

     Rob cowers on his knees, essentially having a full-blown
     nervous breakdown.

                         ROB
               No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

     Plebe Green looks from the nearly-shitting-himself Rob to
     Marok.

     Marok rolls his eyes.

                         DALE
                   (genuine)
               Die like a man at least. There's
               some honor in that.

     Marok looks from one to the other then raises a fist and
     lowers it.

                         MAROK
               Fight!

     IN THE CAGE

     Something flashes across Simon's eyes.


31   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY (FLASHBACK)               31

     All the marine recruits stand in pairs opposite each other.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Full speed. Execute!

     The men grapple. The goal is to take the other man to the
     ground with maximum aggression.

     Simon is paired up with a tough-looking recruit, only
     identifiable by his number 1318.

     Simon and RECRUIT 1318 wrestle. RECRUIT 1318 takes Simon down
     HARD.
                                                                28.


     His face SMACKS against the ground, dirt getting in his
     mouth.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor looms above him, looks down at him.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Recover.

     Simon gets up.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


32   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 32

     Simon looks into the "fight pit" at Rob. Rob is on one knee,
     slow to get up, pleading with Plebe Green.

                         ROB
               Please, I don't want to do this.

     Plebe Green approaches slowly, still nervous.

                          DENNY
               Hit him!

     Plebe Green has to crouch to even attempt a punch but Rob
     instinctively reels back when he sees Plebe Green cock his
     fist. Rob awkwardly rolls to stand up.

     Rob runs around Plebe Green and heads for the exit door,
     where all the other Plebes, along with Dale, Denny & Marok
     are standing.

     He runs in to them and they push him down on the ground.

     Rob looks up at them all.

                         ROB
               Please, stop this. I'm begging you!

     Rob tries grabbing them in his pleading but they just nudge
     him off.

     Plebe Green approaches close behind Rob. Rob's fight or
     flight mechanism reacts. He jumps and turns at Plebe Green,
     swinging his arms like a wild ape. Plebe Green almost trips
     while back peddling.

     Rob falls on top of Plebe Green and they both hit the floor.
     Rob digs his nails into Plebe Green's cheek and scratches
     downward.
                                                        29.


Green tries pushing Rob off to no avail, then pulls Rob's
head in to a head butt. Rob's head ricochets back with stars
in his eyes. Rob falls backwards.

Plebe Green throws a couple punches in Rob's stomach then
rises. Then he kicks Rob's in the stomach a few times, and
once in the face which puts Rob seemingly out of commission.

AGAINST THE WALL

The plebes start cheering.

Denny and Dale lean, watching.

                    DALE
          This is a joke.

                     DENNY
          Obviously you didn't sell them on
          their out.

                    DALE
          Don't start, this isn't on me. The
          first one's always the worst. They
          don't believe it's real yet.

IN THE RING

Rob finally just cowers in the fetal position, shielding his
body with his arms.

Plebe Green looks from him to Marok, who stands ringside.

                    MAROK
          Every opponent is different. Your
          job is the same.

IN THE CAGE

Wayne shakes his head.

Sean turns away, he can't bear to watch.

IN THE RING

Plebe Green finally just KICKS Rob in the chest, knocking him
down.

He goes to mount Rob but he flees before Plebe Green can snag
him.

Looking around the room, seeing nothing but ANGRY FACES of
the other Plebes, SHOUTING and CHEERING for Plebe Green. Rob
finally turns to face his opponent like he means it.
                                                           30.


He SCREAMS and rushes Plebe Green, tackling him to the
ground.

The other Plebes HOOT and HOLLER.

Plebe Green simply HEAD BUTTS Rob again, dazing him, and
reverses their positions.

He mounts Rob and BATTERS him.

It only takes a couple strong punches before Rob is out.

Plebe Green rises.

The other Plebes CHEER his victory.

But Marok steps in and wags a finger. Not so fast.

                     MAROK (CONT'D)
               (to all the Plebes)
          Were you asked to incapacitate a
          man?

                      PLEBES
          No, sir!

                    MAROK
          You were asked to fight a man to
          the death, correct?

                      PLEBES
          Yes, sir!

Marok nods to Plebe Green.

                    MAROK
          Do your job.

He steps back out of the circle.

Plebe Green looks down at Rob, whose eyes are flickering
open.

He steps close to him, reluctant.

He looks back at the others, as if to say, "Look at what I'm
dealing with here".

Plebe Green BEATS Rob's face in. Again and again and again.

Finally, with Rob barely looking human, Plebe Green rises.
Rob's blood marks his fists.
                                                             31.


     Marok steps in and check's Rob's pulse. He stands and lifts
     Plebe Green's arm.

                          MAROK (CONT'D)
               Winner!

     The other Plebes rush in and congratulate Plebe Green, who
     can only look down at the dead Rob with remorse.

     IN THE CAGE

     Simon and the others look on, grim.

     IN THE RING

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               To the ceremony room!

     The other Plebes cheer and push a dazed Plebe Green out the
     door, Marok, Dale and Denny follow.


33   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM - NIGHT                           33

     The other Plebes are gathered in the back of the room, with
     Plebe Green alone up front besides Marok.

     Dale and Denny lean against the wall, watching.

     Marok holds a leather-bound book and a knife.

                         MAROK
               You have crossed over. Noah Grant,
               I offer you membership. Do you
               accept?

                          NOAH/PLEBE GREEN
               I do.

     Marok opens the book and hands Noah the knife.

     Noah cuts open his hand down the middle and presses his blood
     onto the blank page.

                          MAROK
               Welcome.

     CHEERS echo from the other Plebes in the back.


34   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                34

     The captives listen hopelessly to the sounds of cheering from
     upstairs.
                                                               32.


     Two Plebes enter, the captives stiffen.

     But they're only there to drag Rob's dead body away.

                          SIMON
               Initiation rites. Gangs do stuff
               like this.

                         WAYNE
               Not like this.

     Sean looks over, he has been crying.

                         SEAN
               I don't want to do this.

                         WAYNE
               I'm taking one of them with me.

                         ERIC
               I haven't thrown a punch since high
               school. I was on the wrestling
               team, but I lost most of my
               matches.

                         WAYNE
               You just have to want it more than
               the other guy.

     Simon looks ahead, lost in memories.


35   INT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)            35

     Simon and Recruit 1318 stand across from each other. They're
     completely soaked in sweat, exhausted, dirty and generally
     look like they've had the shit kicked out of them.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor's demeanor, on the other hand, is
     exactly the same.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Full speed. Execute!

     Simon and Recruit 1318 go at it again, but it looks more like
     a long hug than a fight. Simon ties up Recruit 1318's hands
     like a woozy boxer.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor sees and approaches.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Recruit, are you conserving energy
               during my drill?
                                                        33.


                      SIMON
          No, sir.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Step out, recruit.

                      SIMON
          Yes, sir.

Simon disengages from Recruit 1318.

                      STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          On me.

Staff Sergeant Raynor walks Simon to the side as the rest of
the men continue the drill.

                      STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          Twenty.

                      SIMON
          Yes, sir.

Simon drops and struggles through pushups.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          This is Day One, recruit.

Simon doesn't respond. His pushup looks like it's happening
in slow motion.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          The Marine Corps is not for
          everyone. There's a reason it's
          called the few and the proud. Do
          you want to be here?

Simon can barely croak out a response.

                      SIMON
          Yes, sir.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Can't hear you, recruit.

Simon can barely move, he's in the "down" position of his
pushup and not going "up".

                    SIMON
          Yes, I want to be here, sir, but...

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          But what!? Are you taking a god-
          damn nap right now?
                    (MORE)
                                                             34.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Are you a child? Do you think next
               I'm gonna bend over and wipe your
               ass?

     Simon is delirious from fatigue.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               You want your mama? She ain't here.
               I'm your mama now.

     Simon can't help but crack a tiny smile at the absurdity of
     the remark.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Is this all a big fucking joke to
               you!?

                           SIMON
               No, sir.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               I know your father.

     Simon stops attempting to do pushups and just looks at Staff
     Sergeant Raynor.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               What would he think if he saw you
               right now?

     Off Simon's wounded gaze.

                                                 END FLASHBACK:


36   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                          36

     A few of the plebes carry Rob's dead body as a unit. They are
     far in the woods. In mid-conversation:

                         PLEBE GREEN
               -At first. But I don't know in the
               heat of the moment, you guys all
               yelling...It just kind of took me
               over.


37   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                                  37

     Denny, Dale and Marok sit around the office. Denny reviews
     security camera footage from a variety of perspectives
     outside and around the house on a laptop.
                                                        35.


                    DALE
          I was scared there for a second;
          Green looked like he was going to
          eat it.

                    MAROK
          Respect the process, his name is
          Noah.

                    DALE
          I thought Noah was going to get
          beat by a rich kid who may or may
          not have shit himself.

                    MAROK
          And he didn't. When push came, he
          shoved.

                    DENNY
              (to Dale)
          Let's not lie to each other, you
          didn't exactly blow away the
          competition yourself.

                    DALE
          The guy they gave me was six-five.
          He was a fucking Goliath. He looked
          like me if I ate another me.

                    DENNY
          You kicked him in the balls.

                     DALE
          David used a slingshot against
          Goliath. Resourcefulness isn't a
          bad thing.

                    DENNY
          David didn't kick Goliath in the
          balls.

                     DALE
          Your guy probably started shaving
          that week.

                    DENNY
          Nah, he just looked young.

                    DALE
          He was crying for his mommy.

Dale chuckles. Smacks Denny on the arm, looking for someone
to laugh with him.
                                                                36.


                         DALE (CONT'D)
                   (re-enacting)
               Remember? "Mom! I love you!"

     Marok and Denny darken.

     Denny grabs Dale's head with one hand and taps Dale on the
     forehead with the other, like he's checking to hear a sound.

                         DALE (CONT'D)
               What are you doing?

                         DENNY
               Trying to see if it's hollow.
               Because you're such an idiot I
               can't believe there's a brain in
               there.

     Dale shakes him off.

                            DALE
               Fuck off.

                         DENNY
               You don't deserve to be here.

                            DALE
               Hey!

                         MAROK
               Enough. Let's get the next fight
               started.

     The two head for the door.

                         DALE
               Oh, so I'm the asshole?


38   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                38

     The men return with PLEBE SILVER (20s), a lithe, intense
     little man, stepping into the ring.

                         PLEBE ORANGE
               You can take him.

     Plebe Silver glances over at Sean, who's a nervous wreck.

                         PLEBE SILVER
               I don't know, he might cry at me.

     Dale, armed (as always when interacting with the men in the
     cage) steps over and opens it, Denny behind him as back up.
                                                        37.


                    DALE
          Let's go, girly.

The others immediately look to Sean, who seems to be near
having a panic attack at the idea. He's hyper-ventilating.

Sean won't move.

                    DENNY
          We're on a schedule.

Dale looks again to Sean.

                    DALE
          I'm not asking you, ya big
          jellyfish. Move.

Simon steps in front of him.

                    SIMON
          He's not ready. Let me go first.

Dale smirks.

                    DALE
          The order does not change. He's
          coming out, now.

Sean can't bear to move. Dale raises his gun.

                    DALE (CONT'D)
          Or I'm just killing you. Your
          choice.

Sean finally steps out.

Dale closes the cage.

He and Denny drag Sean into the ring.

The other Plebes crack jokes and LAUGH in the background.

Plebe Silver looks across at Sean, almost disappointed at
what he's got to deal with.

Marok steps into the middle of the ring. He again raises his
fist and lowers it quickly.

                    MAROK
          Fight!

Marok steps out. Sean drops to his knees and looks down. He
shakes his head to and fro.
                                                                38.


                         SEAN
               I won't do it. I won't do it.

                         SIMON
               Get up!

     Plebe Silver approaches.

                         PLEBE SILVER
               At least stand up.

     Sean looks into his eyes, paralyzed with fear.

                         PLEBE SILVER (CONT'D)
               Fine.

     Plebe Silver meets his look. Not fazed. Just focused. He
     KICKS Sean in the face. Sean falls back in to a fetal
     position and weeps loudly.

     Plebe Silver kneels next to him and throws a few punches to
     Sean's face, knocking him out.

     Simon and Wayne turn away.

     Plebe Silver doesn't hesitate and reaches for Sean's neck.
     The crack is echoed throughout the room.

     IN THE CAGE

     No one says anything. What could you say?

     IN THE RING

     Marok steps in to check Sean's pulse.

     He stands and raises Plebe Silver's arm.

                         MAROK
               Winner!

     IN THE CAGE

     The captives just stare at the ground, despondent.


39   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM - NIGHT                           39

     Marok closes another bloody page in the book, Plebe Silver's
     hand is cut as in the earlier initiation.

     The other Plebes CHEER and lead Plebe Silver out of the room
     with back-slaps and affirmations.
                                                          39.


One particular plebe, PLEBE RED, lingers.

                    PLEBE RED
          Hey, can I talk to you?

                     MAROK
          We talked about this, no special
          treatment.

                    PLEBE RED
          I just wanted to talk to you for a
          second.

Marok steps to the end of the room and closes the door.

                    MAROK
          What is it?

Plebe Red doesn't respond immediately.

                    PLEBE RED
          This is just a lot to take in.

Marok doesn't know how to respond.

                    PLEBE RED (CONT'D)
          This is why you wanted me to start
          taking boxing classes, isn't it?

                    MAROK
          I made sure you were prepared and
          you are. Lets talk more later, if
          they think I'm stacking anything in
          your favor it'll come down on me.

                    PLEBE RED
          Okay, I'm sorry.

Plebe Red still seems nervous.

                    MAROK
          Don't second guess yourself, you
          know what this is worth. Just don't
          forget the kind of opportunities
          that are coming to you.

                    PLEBE RED
          I know, I mean I don't know but I
          can imagine. It's not that... I
          just want to know how you live with
          it.

Marok stiffens.
                                                        40.


                    MAROK
          What kind of question is that?

                    PLEBE RED
          When I think about doing it, I'm
          not scared. I mean, I'm not scared
          of the fight. I know I can fight. I
          think about tonight when I go to
          sleep. And the next night. And a
          night ten years from now.

                    MAROK
          Did I not make clear to you the
          seriousness of this commitment?
          This is a conversation you have the
          day I tell you about joining, not
          the day you-

                    PLEBE RED
          I know.

                    MAROK
          What did I say? I said you have to
          be willing to die and kill to be a
          part of this. And you said you
          understood.

                    PLEBE RED
          It's different when the guy is on
          his knees crying in front of you.

                    MAROK
          No. It's not.

                    PLEBE RED
          Just answer me one question.

Marok glances at the door, as if expecting someone to come
through any second.

                    MAROK
          One. Then so help me, I'll throw
          you out of here myself.

                    PLEBE RED
          Do you still think about the guy -
          the one you-

                    MAROK
          The one I killed.

                    PLEBE RED
          Yeah.
                                                41.


Marok stares at Plebe Red.

                    MAROK
          Yes.

Plebe Red doesn't say anything.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          A couple months ago, I go out. See
          this girl. The type of girl where
          you feel like you don't even
          deserve to look at her. Somehow, I
          take her home. And I'm looking up
          at her as we're doing it and
          thinking it's not fair how lucky I
          am to be here, with her.
          Afterwards, she lays on my arm,
          smiling at me, like there's some
          funny secret between us and the
          whole thing is so god-damned
          wonderful I just want to puke. I
          lay back and stare at the ceiling.
          And that. That's when I think of
          him.

Plebe Red needs a moment to process this.

                    PLEBE RED
          So you regret it.

                    MAROK
          I don't regret it. That's the
          point. It's that important.

                    PLEBE RED
          Why?

                    MAROK
          You're my brother. My blood. But I
          trust any one of these guys in this
          book-

He lifts the book up.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          -more than I trust you. Because it
          happens to them too. You and I are
          brothers because we came out of the
          same womb. Me and them are brothers
          because we're the same - the way
          only something like that can make
          us. It's part of me now, like it's
          part of them and we'll always
          protect each other.
                    (MORE)
                                                               42.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               Once you're like that with another
               person you'll understand there's no
               going back.

     Off Marok's determined gaze:


40   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                               40

     The captives sit around the cage, all except Simon, who
     stands.

                         ERIC
               I wonder who's going to be next.

     A LONG silence before...

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
               I tried to kill myself once.

     Wayne glances over.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
               Almost sorta funny now, with
               this...

     Simon doesn't turn around.

     Eric looks at Wayne, just glad someone's listening.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
               I took pills. They say usually men
               do something more intense, like
               shoot themselves or jump off a
               cliff or whatever. But I took
               pills. I wasn't sure if I had
               enough left, so I tried to mix it
               with some vodka, thought maybe
               that'd help. I woke up the next day
               with a stomach ache and a migraine.

     He almost laughs, a grim snort.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
               I couldn't even kill myself right.

     Simon turns around.

                         SIMON
               Enough of that. I'm not dying here.

                         ERIC
               You think they'd really let you go
               if you win?
                                                                43.


                         SIMON
               Wasn't what I meant.

     Simon looks at Wayne.

                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna need your help.


41   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                                  41

     Dale shoots darts at the wall. Marok looks over paperwork at
     his desk. Denny is still watching the security footage, He
     notices Eric on it.

     Dale tries to show Denny a photo of a pretty girl on his
     cellphone.

                         DALE
               I'm telling you, she wants me.

                         DENNY
               Your own mother doesn't want you.

     Denny's phone BEEPS.

     He takes a final dart from Dale's other hand and throws it.
     Bullseye.

                         DALE
               Do that again.

     Denny smiles and heads for the door with Marok.

                         DALE (CONT'D)
               One time in a hundred .... I beat
               you in darts all the time! Son of a
               bitch.

     Dale exits.


42   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                42

     Marok, Dale and Denny, along with all the Plebes, descend.

     The Plebes form their circle, with Marok in the middle.

     Dale steps over to the cage.

                         DALE
               Eric Wims. Come on down.

     Dale unlocks the cage door-
                                                               44.


     And hears a LOUD CLANKING against the back wall as a handful
     of coins ricochets against the back wall.

     Dale glances that direction.

     Simon SLAMS the cage door forward and INTO Dale's face.

     He sprints out of the cage like a bat out of hell and makes
     for the steps.

     Denny is there to block him.

     He lunges at Simon...

     ...but Simon counters his punch with the smoothness of a
     trained fighter and twists his arm back, grips the back of
     his head and SMASHES it against the wall.

     ...The others are already running for him, but Simon's out
     the door before they can reach him.

     IN THE CORNER

     Marok kneels, looking at what made the noise...

     Loose change.

     He looks over at Wayne, who holds a quarter up between his
     fingers.

     He smirks at Marok, palms the coin and flips him the bird.


43   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                           43

     Simon runs.

                           DENNY (O.S.)
                 You're outnumbered and unarmed! How
                 long you think you're gonna last?

     Simon just keeps running.


44   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)             44

     Staff Sergeant Raynor stands in the center of the clearing.
     Around him the recruits jog in a loose circle.

     He paces.

     Checks his watch.
                                                        45.


                      STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Sprint!

The men - clearly running on fumes - do their best to sprint.

Recruit 2491 manages to keep pace with the pack, but grumbles
under his breath.

                    RECRUIT 2491
          I'm going back to working at the
          gas station, this is fucking
          bullshit.

He looks at the others jogging besides him.

                    RECRUIT 2491 (CONT'D)
          You guys on steroids or something?
          Jesus. I don't care if they do make
          your balls shrink, get me some of
          that stuff.

Simon is noticeably lagging more than the others.

Staff Sergeant Raynor falls in line and jogs besides him.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Did I order you to limp along like
          a wounded gazelle, recruit?

                      SIMON
          No...

                      STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          No, what?

                    SIMON
          Staff Sergeant.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Now you put the words together,
          recruit. My daughter is two years
          old and she can handle that
          concept.

                    SIMON
          No, Staff Sergeant.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
              (lowering his voice to a
               whisper)
          You've been behind in every drill.
          Run, Simon.
                                                              46.


     Simon swallows and RUNS, GRUNTING in pain.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


45   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                            45

     Simon swallows and RUNS.


46   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                            46

     The Plebes, Dale, Marok and Denny are all rushing through the
     woods in a loose assemblage.

     Marok jogs beside Denny.

                         DENNY
               We've lost sight of him.

                         DALE
               Fucker can run.

                         MAROK
               I don't know which one of you is
               worse.

                         DENNY
               Me? He's the one who let him out
               the cage.

                         DALE
               Yeah, like you were a big help, you
               did a great job getting out of his
               way, fucking hotshot-

                         MAROK
               Shut up! Fan out and find him.

     Dale and Denny step up and organize the men, shouting
     directions and two man teams.

                         DENNY
               Red and blue, head that way!

                         DALE
               Orange and silver, follow me!


47   EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT                                 47

     Simon reaches the clearing where the cars are parked.

     Sees the black pickup.
                                                               47.


     He doesn't hesitate. Grabs a rock off the ground and REARS
     BACK as he reaches the window.


48   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                           48

     Plebe Red and PLEBE ORANGE, now separate from the pack, look
     out for Simon.

                         PLEBE ORANGE
               We shouldn't have to do this.

                         PLEBE RED
               Keep it down.

                         PLEBE ORANGE
               This is ridiculous.

                         PLEBE RED
               It's all part of it.

                         PLEBE ORANGE
               Fuck that, we're already supposed
               to fight a man to death tonight, we
               shouldn't have to worry about this
               too, this is not part of it.

                         PLEBE RED
               He's just one guy.

     They hear the CRACKING of a car window in the distance.

                         PLEBE RED (CONT'D)
               Over there.

     They hurry that way.


49   EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT                                49

     Plebe Red and Plebe Orange enter the clearing cautiously.
     There's no sign of Simon.

     They creep through the maze of parked cars, ducking around
     every corner.

                         PLEBE ORANGE
                   (stage whisper)
               You see anything?

                         PLEBE RED
                   (stage whisper)
               Shut up. He'll hear us.
                                                           48.


Still nothing.

Plebe Orange turns a corner and HALTS.

There's a gun to his head. Simon leans close to his ear.

                    SIMON
          You should have listened to your
          friend.

Plebe Red steps into view. Sees them.

Simon points the gun at Plebe Red.

                    SIMON (CONT'D)
          Stop right there.

Plebe Orange takes the opportunity to swing his head back
INTO Simon, dazing him.

Simon tries to recover but Plebe Orange grapples with him for
control of the gun.

Plebe Red rushes forward and TACKLES Simon to the ground.

In the struggle the gun GOES OFF.

Simon disentangles and tries to stand but Plebe Orange grabs
his leg and PULLS.

Plebe Red rolls over, bleeding from his shoulder.

Simon loses his balance and falls, the gun SMACKS against the
ground and comes loose from his grasp.

Plebe Orange snags it and COLDCOCKS Simon with the butt of
the gun.

                    PLEBE ORANGE
          I should shoot you.

                    DALE (O.S.)
          But you won't.

Plebe Orange looks up. Dale and a couple other Plebes have
arrived.

Dale steps closer and sees the injury to Plebe Red.

                    DALE (CONT'D)
          Shit.
                                                              49.


     He makes a call.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:


50   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                            50

     Marok, running with several other Plebes, answers.

                         MAROK
               Almost there.

                         DALE
               We got him.

                         MAROK
               Thank Christ.

                         DALE
               It's not all good news. He had a
               gun.

                         MAROK
               Where did he get a gun?

                         DALE
               Must have been in one of the cars.
               He shot your brother.

     Marok simply hangs up.


51   INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              51

     Simon is dragged in at gun point, Plebe Red and Orange follow
     behind. Marok approaches Plebe Red. Plebe Red stops and
     acknowledges him.

                            MAROK
               Shit.

                            PLEBE RED
               I'm sorry.

                            MAROK
               Shit!

     Marok turns away as Simon is thrown against the floor.

                            MAROK (CONT'D)
               Hold him.

     Dale and Denny lift Simon up and hold his arms.
                                                               50.


     Marok winds up and GUT PUNCHES Simon, who doubles over.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               Lift his head up.

     Denny pulls Simon's hair, forcing his head up. Marok puts his
     hands around Simon's neck - tightens his fists. Simon's eyes
     widen and he tries to squirm free but he is held back well by
     the others. Simon is choking to death.

                         DALE
               Marok?

     Marok stares at Simon with murderous eyes. Finally Marok lays
     off. Simon inhales deeply.

                         MAROK
               Remember my face. It's the last
               thing you'll see before you die.


52   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                               52

     Simon is thrown into the cell, looking beat-to-hell.


53   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                                 53

     Dale, Marok, Denny and Plebe Orange are gathered around Plebe
     Red.

     Plebe Orange wraps gauze around Plebe Red's wound.

                         DENNY
                   (to Plebe Orange)
               Is there an exit wound?

                         PLEBE ORANGE
               Yes. In and out.
                   (to Plebe Red)
               You got lucky.

     He pats Plebe Red on the other shoulder.

                         PLEBE ORANGE (CONT'D)
               We gotta get you to a hospital
               though.

     Denny looks at Marok.

     His expression turns grim.
                                               51.


                    MAROK
          Guys, step outside for a minute,
          okay?

Plebe Red looks up.

                    PLEBE RED
          What's going on?

                    PLEBE ORANGE
          Whose car am I taking him to the
          hospital in?

                    MAROK
          Just step out for two minutes.

Marok leans close to Plebe Red.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          Don't leave yet.

He hugs Plebe Red.

                       MAROK (CONT'D)
          It's okay.

Plebe Red and Plebe Orange exit, nervous.

Marok spins on Denny.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          If you're going to say something
          then say it.

                    DENNY
          It was already questionable
          bringing your brother into the
          fold.

                     MAROK
          He's never gotten special
          treatment.

                    DENNY
          Then you'll agree we can't start
          now. We're accountable for this
          group.

                     DALE
          He got shot, what the fuck are you
          talking about? He's not gonna stay
          and fight.

Marok and Denny are silent.
                                                             52.


                          DALE (CONT'D)
                He's not seriously going to...

                          DENNY
                The rules are the rules. No
                exceptions. No rescheduling.

                          MAROK
                He's right. The fight goes on. Just
                give me a couple minutes alone to
                talk to him.


54   INT. HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                              54

     Plebe Red and Plebe Orange sit in the hallway beside the door
     to the office.

     Neither one speaks.

     They just stare at the door, unable to hear what's going on
     inside.

                          PLEBE ORANGE
                They're going to make you fight.

                           PLEBE RED
                No way.

                          PLEBE ORANGE
                Then what's taking so long?

                          PLEBE RED
                They can't.

                          PLEBE ORANGE
                Who knows you're here?

                           PLEBE RED
                No one.

     Silence.

                           PLEBE RED (CONT'D)
                Why?

     The door opens. Marok looks at his brother. His look says it
     all.

                           PLEBE RED (CONT'D)
                Shit.
                                                     53.


55   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                       55

     Marok and Plebe Red walk in.

                         MAROK
               How you feeling?

                         PLEBE RED
               Kinda like I just got fucking shot.

                         MAROK
               Do you think you can fight?

                         PLEBE RED
               Are you kidding? Screw that! I'll
               wait till' next year.

                         MAROK
               It's not that simple actually,
               everybody is given one attempt at
               the final challenge... it's an
               unfair situation, I know.

                         PLEBE RED
               I can't fight.

                         MAROK
               That guy you're against is nothing,
               I doubt he's ever been in a real
               fight. I have some pain pills
               they'll help you...

                         PLEBE RED
               Are you listening? I'm not doing
               it! If that means I can't get
               initiated then so be it!

                          MAROK
               Here's the thing, you swore by the
               code to accept your final
               challenge.

                           PLEBE RED
               So what!?

                         MAROK
               So it means you have to go through
               with it.

                         PLEBE RED
               And if I don't? You gonna kill me?
                                                                54.


                         MAROK
               This is how it works, the rules are
               not suggestions, that's how it's
               always been... If you don't do this
               I can't protect you.

     Plebe Red is panicky now.

                         PLEBE RED
               So, so... So, you just let me
               leave, you can say you don't know
               where I went.

                         MAROK
               I can't do that.

                         PLEBE RED
               This is insane! I can barely lift
               my arm, there's no way I can fight!

     Marok opens a drawer in the desk and pulls a pill bottle out.

                         PLEBE RED (CONT'D)
               Look at me. I'm your brother. Your
               actual brother, does that not mean
               anything to you?

                         MAROK
               This is bigger than you and me. You
               need to accept that this is
               happening and focus on getting
               yourself through it. I'm sorry.

     Marok hands Plebe Red the bottle of pills.


56   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                56

     The Plebes and recruiters descend. Plebe Red wears a shirt
     that covers his bandaging.

     He takes his position in the center of the fight circle.

     IN THE CAGE

     Simon smiles.

                         SIMON
               They really are crazy.

     He nudges Wayne.

                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               That's the one I shot.
                                                         55.


                    WAYNE
          Which shoulder.

                    SIMON
          Left.

                    WAYNE
          Good.

Dale approaches the cage.

                    DALE
              (to Eric)
          Let's go, twiggy.

Eric, hanging back, looks up as if to say, "Who, me?".

He looks from Dale to Simon and Wayne.

                    WAYNE
          Bury that motherfucker.

Eric reluctantly exits the cage.

IN THE RING

Eric steps in. Marok officiates as before.

                    MAROK
          Fight!

Plebe Red approaches, clearly favoring his right arm.

Eric raises his fists, with the awkward stance of someone who
has never fought before.

Plebe Red takes a swing with his right, but when he does his
left hand sags, leaving him vulnerable to a counter-punch.

IN THE CAGE

Simon focuses on that shoulder.

                    SIMON
          Left shoulder, Eric!

IN THE RING

Eric dodges the blows, but misses the opening to counter.

Plebe Red becomes more aggressive, getting closer and
throwing multiple punches.
                                                        56.


Eric takes a nasty shot on the chin and reels, but keeps his
feet.

He manages to get a punch in...

...right to Plebe Red's injured shoulder.

Plebe Red grimaces and GROANS in pain. He tags Eric with a
right hook that probably dislocates his jaw.

Eric doesn't back down, he takes it and keeps coming.

Plebe Red swings with his right again, Eric CATCHES his fist
and then with his other hand repeatedly punches the injured
shoulder.

IN THE CAGE

With real hope of a victory for the first time, Simon and
Wayne come alive.

                    SIMON (CONT'D)
          Keep going!

                    WAYNE
          Beat his ass into the ground!

IN THE RING

Eric pounds on Plebe Red.

BESIDE THE RING

Marok tenses, he looks like he might spring into action any
moment.

Denny notices. He puts a calming hand on Marok.

Marok looks at him.

                    DENNY
          You step in, you destroy the whole
          process.

IN THE RING

Finally, Plebe Red kicks Eric hard in the shin.

Wincing, Eric stops punching for a moment.

It's enough. Plebe Red lurches forward, trying to bring Eric
to the ground...
                                                          57.


...but Eric sidesteps and manages to take Plebe Red down with
an awkward trip/tackle. It's not pretty, but it works.

Eric takes both hands and RIPS open Plebe Red's shirt.

The bandaging on his injured shoulder is exposed now.

IN THE CAGE

Simon can't help but allow himself a tiny bit of hope.

IN THE RING

Plebe Red fumes. He reverses positions on Eric and tries to
get him in a chokehold, but Eric, thin as he is, wriggles
away.

Now they're back to square one. Face-off. But Plebe Red's
shirt hangs off him in two pieces.

He rushes forward, hands up, favoring his injured shoulder.

Eric feints towards the opposite side, drawing Plebe Red's
guard that way.

Then he reaches in, quick, and RIPS open the bandage,
exposing the bare wound.

He pays for it....

BAM!

Plebe Red hits him with an uppercut that likely costs Eric a
tooth.

Eric falls to his knees.

Plebe Red SWINGS...

...Eric dips his head and drives FORWARD, taking Plebe Red to
the ground.

Plebe Red doesn't allow him to stay on top of him, but as he
tries to rise Eric PUNCHES his injured, now bare, shoulder
wound.

Plebe Red SCREAMS.

Eric swoops in like a shark sniffing blood.

He PUNCHES again and again. The wound is bleeding anew.

Plebe Red retreats, holding his injured shoulder. His arm is
sagging badly.
                                                           58.


Eric presses his advantage while he can.

BESIDES THE RING

Marok is sweating. Dale and Denny notice.

IN THE RING

Eric has a much easier time avoiding Plebe Red's punches now
that he's clearly fighting with just one hand.

And he's starting to nail some punches of his own.

Plebe Red's feet wobble.

Eric KICKS them out from under him.

Plebe Red drops.

Eric STOMPS on his face.

IN THE CAGE

We don't see the stomps, but Simon and Wayne do.

More encouraged with each STOMP.

BESIDE THE RING

Marok can't take it anymore. He lunges towards the ring.

                    MAROK
          No!

Dale and Denny have to hold him back. They can barely do it.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          NO!

IN THE RING

Blood on his shoe, Eric stands over Plebe Red, victorious.

IN THE CAGE

Simon and Wayne are as stunned as everyone else.

IN THE RING

Eric looks towards the others. As if to say, "Now what?"

BESIDES THE RING

Marok has tears streaming down his face. He enters.
                                                          59.


IN THE RING

Eric steps away as much as possible. Doesn't matter. Marok
goes straight to his brother.

He cradles his bloody face in his arms.

                    MAROK (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I should have never let
          you do this.

He looks up and sees Simon.

IN THE CAGE

Simon meets his gaze. The look Marok gives him is
unmistakable. If looks could kill...

BESIDES THE RING

Dale and Denny watch the Plebes grow noticeably concerned
over their leader's lack of composure.

IN THE RING

Dale and Denny step in.

                    DENNY
          Winner. You're free to go.

Eric looks back as in disbelief but neither Denny or Dale
make a move for him. He's so surprised he doesn't move right
away.

IN THE CAGE

Simon and Wayne look at Eric.

                    WAYNE
          Get the fuck out of here!

IN THE RING

Eric bolts for the steps.

Denny, still shaken-up by Marok's brother's death, gives Dale
a look.

                    DALE
          I'll make sure he gets to his car
          safe.

Is he being serious or is it a loaded statement? Dale's
expression could be taken either way.
                                                             60.


     He follows Eric up the steps.

                          DENNY
                    (to Plebes)
               Go up. We'll set up for the next
               one.

     The Plebes looked confused as well but follow instructions.

     IN THE CAGE

     Simon looks towards the door Eric has just walked out of.

                         SIMON
               There's no way.

     IN THE RING

     Denny puts a comforting hand on Marok's shoulder.

                         DENNY
               Let me help you take him up.

     Marok barely acknowledges Denny's presence. Slowly he rises
     and they gently lift up Plebe Red and take him up.

     IN THE CAGE

     Simon watches the scene, sees Marok's very real emotion as he
     carries his brother.


57   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT           57
     (FLASHBACK)

     Simon and the other recruits are running down a path, each
     man carries a fellow recruit over his shoulder.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor stands ahead on the path, shrouded in
     smoke from the POV of the recruits.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.)
               Tear gas will not kill you but it
               will feel like death warmed over.

     The recruits move ahead, the smoke looming in front of them.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.)
               You will feel pain of an intensity
               you've never known, and it won't
               stop. You won't be able to see
               shit.
                         (MORE)
                                                         61.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You'll cough your damn lungs out
          but be careful when you breath
          because it'll feel like you're
          inhaling hellfire.

They move into the smoke and sure enough, the COUGHING begins
quickly.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.)
          But no matter how terrible you're
          gonna feel, remember that you CAN
          move through it.

The recruits slow to a crawl, devastated by the smoke,
awkwardly moving forward.

Many drop their fellow recruits.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.)
          You don't feel pain. You don't feel
          fatigue. You don't believe in it.

Simon winces in pain, drops HIS recruit.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (V.O.)
          Think about why I am making you do
          this. Think about what this man on
          your shoulder represents to you.
          This is who we are.

Simon claws his way forward through the smoke.

He CRIES. Saliva bunches up in his mouth and he drools like a
mangy dog.

He makes it out through the tear gas.

Staff Sergeant Raynor is waiting for him.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Where is your fallen comrade,
          recruit?

                    SIMON
          I... He... Can't...

                       STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Answer me!

                       SIMON
          He's...
                                                                62.


                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               It's not "Some Men Left Behind",
               recruit. Go back and get him.

     Simon just struggles to catch his breath.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Now!

     Simon doesn't move. Staff Sergeant Raynor turns him around
     and KICKS him in the ass, pushing him forward.

     Simon just trips and falls on his face.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


58   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 58

     Simon and Wayne sit in the cage, the basement empty now.

                         WAYNE
               Maybe he made it.

                         SIMON
               You really think that?

                         WAYNE
               No. At least they let him walk out
               here on his own two feet. I didn't
               think he had all that fight in him.

                         SIMON
               I don't think he thought he had all
               that fight in him.


59   INT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - REC ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) 59

     WEBCAM

     The following is a webcam exchange, seen entirely through the
     video each participant would see.

     Simon's face fills up the frame, what little we can make out
     behind him looks like some sort of recreation center.

     THE OTHER PARTICIPANT

     Is RYAN, who we can clearly see is relaxing in a comfortable,
     middle-upper class house.

                         RYAN
               Tear gas? Jesus.
                                                               63.


                         SIMON
               Yeah.

                         RYAN
               Is that legal?

                         SIMON
               They do it to every class.

                         RYAN
               How much longer you got?

                          SIMON
               I don't want to think about it. I
               thought I was in shape, I'm dying
               out there.

                         RYAN
               I told you those cigarettes would
               catch up with you. You'll make it
               though. It's in your blood.

                         SIMON
               I don't know. I really don't.

                         RYAN
               Don't break, man. I see your
               parents around the neighborhood,
               they're proud as shit.

     Simon scoffs.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               I'm telling you. You quit this -
               you're gonna regret it for the rest
               of your life. You'll do it, I know
               you will.

     Simon coughs, still messed up from the tear gas drill. He
     doesn't appear so confident.

                                                   END FLASHBACK:


60   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                                    60

     Denny and Marok lay Plebe Red's body on the desk.

     Marok leans his head against his brother's chest, still
     wiping tears from his eyes.

                         DENNY
               We can't keep him up here.
                                                        64.


     Marok looks up at Denny, eyes ablaze with anger.

                          DENNY (CONT'D)
                We can move him later.


61   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                        61

     Silence in the cage.

                          SIMON
                Have you ever killed anyone?

     Wayne takes a moment before responding.

                          WAYNE
                Once I got jumped by this guy.
                There was this little park I cut
                through to get home. Not very well
                lit. It was late, no one around.
                Guy had a knife. We were beefing
                with some crew at the time, don't
                even remember what about now. I got
                the knife off him before he could
                cut me. Pushed him down. I'm
                looking in his eyes and I see this
                look. Only time I ever seen that
                look before was on my little
                brother's face when our daddy used
                to come at him. And then all I
                could see staring up at me was him.
                About to catch a beating from our
                dad.

                          SIMON
                What'd you do?

                           WAYNE
                Let the guy go. I was as surprised
                as he was. He ran off. Never saw
                him again.

     Silence.

                          WAYNE (CONT'D)
                So, no. I haven't.

                          SIMON
                Me neither.

     Quiet.
                                                             65.


                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               How long have you been with...
               whatever crew you're with.

                         WAYNE
               Years. Less than ten, more than
               seven. Gets fuzzy. Where I grew up,
               even if you're not with them, it
               feels like you are.

                         SIMON
               My grandfather flew with the
               Tuskegee Airmen. My dad fought in
               Vietnam. I've been an honorary
               Marine since the day I was born.

                         WAYNE
               But you're not a Marine?

                         SIMON
               No.

                         WAYNE
               So what do you do? Back in the
               world.

                         SIMON
               I'm an assistant manager at a
               grocery store.

     Simon scoffs at himself, Wayne chuckles. For a moment the
     tension is broken.


62   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)            62

     Simon and the other recruits wear night gear and stand at
     attention before Staff Sergeant Raynor, who wears a pair of
     night vision goggles. The recruits noticeably do not have
     this, nor any weaponry.

     The men look beaten down and miserable.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               This will be your first night-time
               op. You will be responsible for
               locating a position on a map and
               finding some intel that is hidden
               at that position. Once you recover
               the intel, you will have to leave
               the map behind and retrace your
               steps to this position we are
               standing in right now.
                                                                66.


     He gestures into the woods.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
                You are disarmed and have lost your
                night vision capability. Stealth is
                your primary concern so you do not
                get your ass killed. Therefore you
                will be completing this task with
                no lights of any kind. Anyone who
                illuminates their flashlight will
                fail the course.

     He looks over their weary faces.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
                You have not slept within the last
                72 hours. You have barely eaten. I
                do not care. I do not care because
                your enemy will not care. He will
                find you if you pass out underneath
                a bush or are too god-damned stupid
                to navigate properly and wander
                into his position. If you do either
                of these things, you will fail the
                course.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor gestures to night vision goggles he
     wears.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
                I will be monitoring your progress.
                First man to make it back earns a
                half hour break and one-

     He takes a candy bar out of his pocket.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
                Genuine chocolate bar.

     He nods.

                          STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
                Ho-ah.

                          RECRUITS
                Ho-ah, Staff Sergeant!


63   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)     63

     Simon tries to check his map in the moonlight. He can barely
     see a thing.
                                                                67.


     He looks into the woods. No recognizable geographical
     features to help him go by.

     He looks behind him. No sign of anyone else.

     He leans against a tree, huffs in frustration.

     His eyes close. He's so bone-tired it's practically a reflex.

     After a moment he comes awake with a start.

     Folds the map up and keeps moving.


64   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)     64

     Simon walks through the woods.

     Something stirs underneath a big log up ahead.

     He squints to make it out in the darkness, but it could be
     anything from this distance.

     He approaches and gradually it's clear: one of his fellow
     recruits has hidden himself under some logs and gone to
     sleep.

     Simon glances around, doesn't see anyone else.

     He kneels down and shakes the man awake.

     It's Recruit 2491, the guy with the big mouth.

                         SIMON
                   (whispering)
               Wake up.

     Recruit 2491 speaks like a man still dreaming.

                          RECRUIT 2491
               Go away.

                         SIMON
               You can't sleep.

     Recruit 2491 glances around.

                         RECRUIT 2491
               You're gonna draw attention to me.
               Get out of here.

     NOT FAR AWAY
                                                                68.


     Staff Sergeant Raynor is crouched behind a fallen tree,
     observing calmly. Seems like he's been there this whole time.

     SIMON AND RECRUIT 2491

     Simon tries to pull Recruit 2491 up, but he resists.

                            RECRUIT 2491 (CONT'D)
               Let me be.

                         SIMON
               I can't do that.

                         RECRUIT 2491
               It's not a team mission.

                         SIMON
               We're Marines. It's always a team
               mission.

     Simon offers his hand.

                         RECRUIT 2491
               We're not Marines yet.

                         SIMON
               Well you definitely won't be if
               Staff Sergeant finds you taking a
               nap.

     Recruit 2491 takes Simon's hand.

                         RECRUIT 2491
               Next time I sleep, I'm going to
               dream about killing you.

                         SIMON
               You're welcome.

     Simon helps him up.

     They head off.

     NOT FAR AWAY

     Staff Sergeant Raynor watches them go. A hint of a smile
     plays across his face.


65   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)     65

     Simon is alone now. He consults his map again in the
     moonlight.
                                                                69.


                           SIMON
                    (to himself)
                Marking...

     Simon carefully studies the trees.

     Finds one that has had a big diagonal line scratched into the
     base with a knife.

     Digs with his hands besides it.

     Nothing.

     So he keeps digging, going around the tree.

     Finally unearths a package, the "intel". It's a rubber-banded
     package wrapped in some cut-up tarp.

     Looks back the way he came.


66   INT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)       66

     Simon emerges from the woods to the original spot where the
     mission briefing took place.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor is waiting for him.

     Simon looks around.

                          SIMON
                Where are the others?

     Staff Sergeant Raynor doesn't respond.

     Instead, he just tosses Simon the candy bar.

                                                   END FLASHBACK:


67   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                  67

     The Plebes and recruiters have returned.

     Plebe Orange is next to fight. He eyeballs Wayne.

     Dale heads for the cage.

                          WAYNE
                    (to Simon)
                I guess it's showtime.

     Wayne gets up.
                                                           70.


                    SIMON
          Hey, I never got your name.

                       WAYNE
          I'm Wayne.

                       SIMON
          Simon.

Simon puts a hand out to shake with Wayne. They lock eyes as
they shake.

                    SIMON (CONT'D)
          Make them pay for it.

                       WAYNE
          You too.

He looks over at Plebe Orange.

Dale opens the cage door.

Wayne exits without hesitation.

He heads into the ring.

Marok officiates, still noticeably upset but keeping his
composure.

                       MAROK
          Fight!

He scampers out.

Wayne doesn't waste time. He moves straight ahead.

And he and Plebe Orange go at it.

It's not like any of the fights we've seen until this point.
These are two strong, capable fighters going toe to toe.

Powerful body blows rattle heads and pound bodies like sides
of meat.

It's nasty and it's non-stop.

After a few minutes of this, both men are exhausted and
bloodied.

Wayne gathers his breath and charges forward, TACKLING Plebe
Orange like an NFL linebacker.

Plebe Orange falls.
                                                           71.


Wayne tries to gouge his eyes out.

BESIDES THE RING

Marok, Dale and Denny stand, real concern showing on their
faces.

IN THE CAGE

Simon watches with bated breath.

                     SIMON
          Do it.

IN THE RING

Plebe Orange SCREAMS and snags one of Wayne's hands at the
wrist.

He TWISTS furiously, using his other hand as leverage.

An audible CRACK echoes sickly across the room.

Wayne falls to the side, holding his limp wrist in pain.

Plebe Orange rises and drop-kicks Wayne in the face.

Wayne topples to the side.

Plebe Orange looms above him.

Woozy, Wayne tries to get up.

Plebe Orange takes his other hand, almost as if he's helping
him up.

But as Wayne rises Plebe Orange pulls him forward by his hand
and PUNCHES with his other hand, the opposing momentums
intensifying the impact.

His fist CRUSHES Wayne's face.

Wayne collapses.

Plebe Orange lays down besides him, pulls his head up into
his arms.

                     PLEBE ORANGE
          Goodbye.

He TWISTS and snaps Wayne's neck.

BESIDES THE RING
                                                                72.


     Marok glares at Simon, satisfied.

     IN THE CAGE

     Two plebes drag Wayne's dead body away.

     One of them is Plebe Gold. He GRINS at Simon like a shark
     seeing a minnow.

     Simon can't bear to look.

     Marok steps right in front of him. Behind him the plebes
     exit.

                         MAROK
               Enjoying the show?

     Simon doesn't respond.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               That was my brother you got killed
               tonight.

                         SIMON
               I shot your brother to defend
               myself.

                         MAROK
               Lot of good it did you. We saved
               the best for last. Your match? He's
               the toughest we got.

                         SIMON
               Yeah? And then what? You all lay
               down and massage each other?

                         MAROK
               I'm glad you're having fun. You'll
               beg me to kill you before this is
               over.


68   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)     68

     Simon and all the other recruits are gathered at the original
     spot where the mission briefing took place.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor collects the "intel" packages from
     them.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Congratulations on a successful
               mission. You all know what's coming
               next. Pace yourselves.
                         (MORE)
                                                             73.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               There's only one rule. Don't stop
               moving. Any man who can not
               complete the march will fail out of
               my Marine corps.
                   (gestures behind him)
               You'll find your packs down by the
               main path back there.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor indicates Simon.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Recruit 4210 was first back and has
               earned himself a reprieve. Recruit
               4210, walk to the road we took in
               and another Staff Sergeant will
               meet you. You'll join us on the
               march after your break.

     Simon looks at the other recruits. Sees nothing but jealousy
     (not malicious, just yearning) and fatigue in their eyes.

     He looks back to Staff Sergeant Raynor.

                         SIMON
               If it's alright, I'd like to stay.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor arches an eyebrow.


69   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT        69
     (FLASHBACK)

     The men march, wearing full rucksacks and gear, about a
     hundred pounds on their backs, tired beyond anything they've
     ever experienced in their lives.

     Simon keeps with the middle of the pack.

     Recruit 2491, marching beside him mumbles:

                         RECRUIT 2491
               You're an idiot.

     He laughs, as much as he's able.

                         SIMON
                   (good-natured)
               Go fuck yourself.

     Recruit 2491 pats Simon on the shoulder, smiles.
                                                        74.


                    RECRUIT 2491
              (making a masturbation
               gesture)
          I don't think I have the energy!

They exchange a weary chuckle.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (O.S.)
          Why is it that every other man in
          this company is ahead of you,
          recruit?

Simon glances back.

Recruit 1318, Simon's sparring partner from earlier, is
lagging behind the pack, badly. Staff Sergeant Raynor walks
besides him.

                      RECRUIT 1318
          I can't-

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Then quit! Do not sully my Marine
          corps with that word, recruit.

                    RECRUIT 1318
          I just need a minute to rest-

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          There will come a time when you're
          in the field and your fellow
          soldiers' lives will depend on you.
          When that time comes, you might be
          tired. You might be hungry. You
          might want to take a shit and nap
          and fuck Suzie Q. Are you going to
          tell them you just needed a minute?

                      RECRUIT 1318
          No...

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          We are one mile into a twenty mile
          march. There is no rest coming for
          you anytime soon. I suggest you
          start marching.

Staff Sergeant Raynor drops behind and observes.

Simon glances back again, sees Recruit 1318 try to muster up
energy and march.

But in doing so, he falls, the weight of the pack throwing
him off balance.
                                                                75.


     Simon jogs back and helps Recruit 1318 up. He walks besides
     him.

                         SIMON
               Stay with me.

     They walk together.

     Behind them, Staff Sergeant Raynor's watchful eye sees all.


70   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT             70
     (FLASHBACK)

     Simon and the other recruits march. The path seems never
     ending. It's dark. No one speaks.

     There's a mournful quality to the whole thing, like these men
     are walking to their own funeral.

                                                   END FLASHBACK:


71   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM - NIGHT                             71

     Plebe Orange's blood marks the book.

     Denny, Dale and Marok oversee as usual.

     The other Plebes exit, CHEER Plebe Orange.


72   INT. HOUSE - OFFICE                                            72

     Marok is seated at the desk when Plebe Gold enters.

                         PLEBE GOLD
               You wanted to see me?

                         MAROK
               What happened earlier. That can't
               happen again. Especially with the
               guy you're fighting.

                           PLEBE GOLD
               It won't.

                         MAROK
               He's trained. He'll know what he's
               doing.

                         PLEBE GOLD
               So do I. It won't be a problem.
                                                              76.


                         MAROK
               Hey! I don't give a shit how tough
               you think you are, listen to me.
               You underestimate him and it'll be
               your body we drag into the woods.
               Do you understand?

                           PLEBE GOLD
               Yes, sir.

                           MAROK
               Good.


73   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 73

     The Plebes gather. Plebe Gold lurks.

     He removes his shirt. This guy could bench press a Hyundai.

     He looks at Simon in the cage and gives him a wink.

     Simon doesn't acknowledge him.


74   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH   - NIGHT          74
     (FLASHBACK)

     The men continue.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor walks alongside, talking to ALL the
     men.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Every single one of you is
               physically capable of doing this.
               Every. Single. One. But before we
               finish tonight I know some of you
               will quit. Happens every time. Just
               ask yourself, is that person you?

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


75   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 75

     Dale opens the cage. Simon heads into the ring.

     Marok steps over to Plebe Gold.

                           MAROK
               Ready?
                                                                77.


                         PLEBE GOLD
               Hit me in the face.

     Marok PUNCHES Plebe Gold in the face.

                         PLEBE GOLD (CONT'D)
               Ahh!

     Plebe Gold grins.


76   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY (FLASHBACK)                76

     Back to Simon and Recruit 1318 grappling each other to the
     ground.

     Simon takes Recruit 1318 down.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


77   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 77

     Simon does the SAME move to Plebe Gold as he approaches.

     He tries to pin him down but Plebe Gold, with his strength,
     rises and PICKS Simon up.

     He SLAMS him to the ground.


78   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT            78
     (FLASHBACK)

     The men trudge on. Some occasionally stumble, eyes closing,
     woozy, dream-like.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor continues alongside.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Think of all you've suffered. All
               the pain and sweat and mud. Another
               fifteen miles and it will all be
               over.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


79   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 79

     Simon rolls out of the way before Plebe Gold can slam his
     elbow down into his face.

     He scrambles to his feet.
                                                           78.


The men face-off.

Plebe Gold feints with his left and connects with a vicious
RIGHT HOOK.

It staggers Simon, who takes the brunt of his meaty paw with
his face.

Plebe Gold presses his momentary advantage and scores another
direct hit, popping Simon in the nose with a JAB.

Simon struggles to keep his feet.

Plebe Gold drives him into the ground with a brutal right-
left combo.

Fresh blood decorates Simon's face.

As Plebe Gold swings in for the kill shot Simon somehow
manages to avoid it.

He scoots forward, low, and wraps his arms around Plebe
Gold's legs, trying to bring him to the ground.

Plebe Gold manages to wriggle free.

Simon stands, huffing and puffing. Bleeding from his nose and
lip.

The other plebes SHOUT and JEER, thirsty for more blood.

Plebe Gold doesn't even seem winded.

He advances once more.

Simon waits.

Plebe Gold throws out a punch Simon swats it aside with his
forearm, then wraps it around Plebe Gold's arm and pivots so
he's directly against Plebe Gold's side.

Putting his entire body into it, he twists.

Plebe Gold's arm contorts at an awkward angle.

Simon drives his fist into Plebe Gold's face as hard as he
can.

Plebe Gold nearly falls.

Simon kicks him in the chest, finishing the job.

Plebe Gold hits the dirt.
                                                          79.


Simon rolls down and gets Plebe Gold into an arm-bar.

Without hesitation, he BREAKS Plebe Gold's arm.

The SNAP is loud enough to quiet the crowd.

Plebe Gold SCREAMS.

Simon uses the distraction to maneuver so he's got Plebe Gold
in a headlock.

Plebe Gold struggles as Simon tries to choke him to death.

Finally Plebe Gold rears up and rips Simon off with his one
good arm.

Again the men face each other - only now Plebe Gold only has
one usable arm.

Simon charges forward and Plebe Gold tries to put his hands
up to block, but with only one good one it's only a matter of
moments before Simon gets in a number of POTENT hits.

Weakened, Plebe Gold tries to fight back but his punches are
getting sloppy.

Simon kicks his legs out from under him.

Then he stands above him and looks directly at Marok.

With his eyes locked on Marok, he drives his foot down.
Twists it with relish.

Plebe Gold lies dead on the floor.

No one knows what to do.

Silence.

                     SIMON
               (to Marok)
           You seem to have a lot of rules.
           Let's see how much you believe in
           them.

Simon turns towards the steps out of the basement.

Marok stands in his path, taking the gun from Dale and
raising it up.

Simon stops.
                                                        80.


                    MAROK
              (to Plebes)
          Take his body out with the others.

The Plebes hurriedly carry Plebe Gold's body out of the room.
The door is shut closed.

                    SIMON
          I want my car keys.

                    DALE
          Doesn't work that way. We'll escort
          you to your car.

                    SIMON
          I'm not moving until I get my car
          keys. And I'm walking out of here
          on my own. If you're letting me go
          it doesn't make any difference.

Neither Marok nor Dale wavers.

                    SIMON (CONT'D)
          He didn't walk out of here, did he?

                    DALE
          Oh, he walked out. He just didn't
          get to walk too far.

Marok drops the gun and returns it to Dale.

                    MAROK
          We're not shooting him.

                       DALE
          We're not?

                       MAROK
          No.

Marok pulls out the initiation knife.

                    SIMON
          Do I get a knife too?

                    DENNY
          Let it go, lets not complicate
          this.

                    MAROK
          It's already complicated.

                    DENNY
          You don't want to do this.
                                                               81.


                         MAROK
               Quiet.

     Marok pulls out the initiation knife.

                         MAROK (CONT'D)
               You killed my brother. My only
               brother. I'm going to make you feel
               his death a dozen times and die on
               the same floor he did. I'm going to
               make you scream for forgiveness.
               Then, once you're so weak you can't
               scream, I'll cut out your tongue
               and watch you choke on it.

     Marok advances.

     Simon avoids a thrust of the knife.

     As opposed to every other fight so far, no one makes a sound
     during this exchange.


80   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT            80
     (FLASHBACK)

     Simon continues along. He TRIPS on a rock.

     Slumps to an awkward seat on the ground.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


81   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 81

     Marok manages to STAB Simon in the side.

     Simon DECKS him, making him lose his grip on the knife.

     He stands there with the blade embedded in his side.

     Looks down at it.


82   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT            82
     (FLASHBACK)

     Staff Sergeant Raynor circles back to Simon after he trips.

     Simon tries to stand.

                         SIMON
               I think I broke something.
                                                          82.


                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Remove your pack.

Simon does. It SLAMS into the ground like it weighs a ton,
which it does.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          And your boot.

Simon slowly does.

Staff Sergeant Raynor takes Simon's foot in his hands and
adjusts it to and fro.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          Does this hurt?

                    SIMON
          I don't know.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          That means no. This?

                      SIMON
          No.

                      STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          And this?

Simon winces and CRIES OUT.

                      SIMON
          Yes!

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          It's not broken. It'll hurt worse
          than holy hell, but legally, you
          can complete the march.

Simon looks up in despair. He puts his boot on.

Staff Sergeant Raynor helps him get his pack on his back.

Doing so nearly knocks him over once the full weight hits
him.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          It's not a race. Just need to
          finish. Don't stop walking.

83   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 83

     Simon RIPS the knife out from his own side and grips it.

     Simon attacks.

     Marok parries and dodges a series of knife thrusts from
     Simon.

     Marok intercepts Simon's swinging arm and bashes the elbow
     backwards with his knee. The knife falls to the ground.

     Simon YELPS in pain but recovers.


84   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT            84

     Simon limps ahead through the woods with the other recruits.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Only twelve miles to go. This is
               like a god-damn pleasure stroll!

     Up ahead a recruit simply drops.

     Staff Sergeant Raynor approaches him.

     It's Recruit 1318.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
               Stand up, recruit.

     Recruit 1318 just keeps shaking his head, no words come out.

     Simon is barely able to muster the energy to look.

                                                  END FLASHBACK:


85   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                 85

     Marok keeps hammering Simon.

     Simon fights back as best he can, but the combined toll of
     his fight with Plebe Gold and now the stab wound is taking
     its effect.

     Marok nails Simon with a gut shot with his fist, doubling him
     over.

                         MAROK
               Where are your jokes now?
                                                             84.


     Marok CLOCKS Simon, knocking him down.

                            SIMON
                  Says the man who brought a knife to
                  a fistfight.

     Marok straddles him.

                            MAROK
                  We're having a fistfight now.

     He PUNCHES Simon.

                            MAROK (CONT'D)
                  How's it going for you?

     And AGAIN.

                            MAROK (CONT'D)
                  I'd say not great.

     He raises Simon's limp face with one hand gripping his hair
     and gives a final PUNCH.

     Simon is catatonic on the floor.


86   EXT. MARINE TRAINING GROUNDS - WOODED PATH - NIGHT          86
     (FLASHBACK)

     Simon keeps marching.

     Behind him on the path, Recruit 1318 unloads his pack and
     watches with shame. He's quit.

     Simon continues.

     But his steps slowly decline in speed.

     It's pitiful to watch. He struggles to put one foot in front
     of the other.

     He leans forward, willing his body to continue, trying to use
     the weight of the pack to his advantage.

     But it just makes him fall.

     He sprawls out on the ground.

     Does not get up.

                            STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (O.S.)
                  Look at me.
                                                         85.


Simon rolls over awkwardly, the pack impeding him.

Staff Sergeant Raynor stands above him. He might as well be
one hundred feet tall.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          You need to stand up.

Simon labors to speak.

                      SIMON
          I... I...

Staff Sergeant Raynor offers Simon his hand, but Simon
doesn't take it.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          What do you want to do? Who do you
          want to be?

Simon doesn't answer.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR (CONT'D)
          Think about your father. Think
          about his father. Your name means
          something out here.

                      SIMON
          No more.

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Not an acceptable answer.

                      SIMON
          No...

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          You're THIS close to finishing this
          out. You want to tell me after it
          all you're really just a piece of
          shit? A guy who can't push through
          when it matters most, to survive?

                      SIMON
          Can't...

                    STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
          Then I don't want you in my Corps,
          getting my men killed. You get to
          do one of two things right now.
          Stand up and keep walking or say "I
          quit".
                                                                86.


                          SIMON
               It's...

     Simon looks ahead, some of the other recruits, including
     Recruit 2491 are glancing back, sympathetic, but only for a
     moment, too exhausted to risk stopping and having to regain
     momentum.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Do you quit?

                                                 INTERCUT WITH:


87   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                87

     Simon laid out on the floor, Marok above him.

     Simon laid out on the ground, Staff Sergeant Raynor above
     him.

                         STAFF SERGEANT RAYNOR
               Do. You. QUIT? Say it! SAY IT!

                          SIMON
               I quit!

     Simon lets his head sag, defeated.

     When he looks up Marok is there.

     He's in the basement.

     Dale looks down at him, almost with pity.

     The faces of his fellow recruits look down on him in pity in
     the forest.

                                                 END INTERCUT:


88   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                                88

     Marok clenches a fist.

                          MAROK
               The end.

                          SIMON
               No!

     Simon finds a seemingly impossible reserve of energy and
     pushes upward.
                                                        87.


His arms SURGE, gripping Marok's shirt with both hands and
pile-driving him backwards, while at the same time lifting
himself off the ground.

Marok winds up on the floor, with Simon standing above him.
It's a feat of strength that looked nearly impossible.

Simon's advantage allows him to retrieve the knife a few feet
back.

He stands, wild-eyed, covered in blood and ROARS.

He looks like the god-damn devil.

A new emotion crosses Marok's face.

Fear.

Dale raises the gun and cocks it.

                    DALE
          Marok?

                    MAROK
          Put it down!

Dale lowers the gun, nervous.

                     MAROK (CONT'D)
              (looking at Simon)
          I got him.

Marok advances again. As he does, Simon starts side stepping
towards Dale's direction, small enough steps that it isn't
noticeable.

Simon imperceptibly eyes Dale and the gun at his side. He
swings the knife at Marok but misses and Marok gets a
straight punch to Simon's nose.

Simon takes the punch and lurches off balance TOWARDS Dale.

He recovers and straightens up, now only five feet away from
Dale.

Another weak attempt with the knife and another connected
round house punch from a tiring Marok, but this time, staging
a knock out punch, Simon back tracks as if falling to the
ground.

But what he's really doing is getting close enough to Dale to
STAB him in the gut.
                                                              88.


     A shocked Dale can't react in time. When the knife sinks into
     him Simon snags the gun.

     In one fluid motion Simon SPINS the gun upward and SHOOTS
     Dale, the bullet going up through his chin and out the back
     of his head.

     Simon pivots, Marok is already sprinting towards him, he
     SHOOTS TWICE just as Marok reaches for him, putting him down.


89   INT. HOUSE - CEREMONY ROOM                                 89

     The echoed gun shots are heard through the empty room.


90   EXT. FOREST - BODY PIT                                     90

     The plebes topple the dead body next to the others. They are
     far from hearing distance.


91   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT                                      91

     Simon points the gun at Denny.

                         DENNY
               You can just walk out.

                         SIMON
               Get the keys.

     Denny pulls them from Dale's pocket.

                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               Throw em to me.

     Denny complies. Simon picks up the keys.

                         SIMON (CONT'D)
               Get in the cage.


92   INT. HOUSE - BASEMENT                                      92

     Simon locks the cage on Denny and turns to walk out.

                         DENNY
               Hey!

     Simon turns. Denny speaks in a tone that almost seems
     sympathetic, as if he feels sorry for Simon.
                                                               89.


                         DENNY (CONT'D)
               Whatever you think you've done
               here, I'd reconsider. Even if you
               walk out that door, it's not over
               for you.

     Simon turns to the door and disappears behind it.


93   EXT. FOREST - MORNING                                          93

     Simon quickly moves along through the trees. He hears the
     Plebes in the distance and manages quietly.

     He finds his car.


94   INT. SIMON'S CAR - MORNING                                     94

     Simon sinks in to the driver seat of his car. He sets the gun
     pointed down in the crack between the driver seat and middle
     console. He leaves his right palm resting over it.

     He starts the car and pulls out. His eyes focused and alert
     as he drives through the forest.


95   EXT. SIMON'S CAR - MORNING                                     95

     And now that US MARINES bumper sticker on Simon's car looks a
     whole lot bigger.

                                                     FADE OUT.

                                                         FADE IN:


96   INT. SECURITY ROOM - MORNING                                   96

     Monitors show footage, from an angle that looks like a
     security camera, of Simon killing Marok and Dale.

                         VOICE #2 (O.S.)
               What a disaster.

                         VOICE #1
               We could have intervened.

                         VOICE #2 (O.S.)
               If they can't get the job done they
               don't deserve our protection.

                          VOICE #1 (O.S.)
               And him?
                                                             90.


                         VOICE #2 (O.S.)
               Being taken care of.


97   EXT. WOODED BACK ROAD - MORNING                             97

     It seems quiet, the calm before the storm.

     Simon drives along.


98   INT. SIMON'S CAR - MORNING                                  98

     Simon notices an SUV turn into the road off a side street
     behind him and accelerate.

     Just like it did when this all started.

     He palms the gun and hits the gas pedal.

                                                     FADE OUT.
