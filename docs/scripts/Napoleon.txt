1   INT. TUILERIES - AUGUST 10, 1792
    TITLE: REVOLUTION
    CAMERA RUNNING BEHIND MARIE-ANTOINETTE LIKE A HORROR FILM
    with her two children, ushered by guards.
    NATIONAL GUARD (REBELS, REVOLUTIONARY MOB) storm the palace.
    They are met with GUNFIRE from the Swiss Guards. Hundreds of
    people are killed but the MOB keeps coming...
    ANGLE, MARIE ANTOINETTE
    Stay with her and the kids locked in a room. SOUNDS
    building...getting closer...unruly m ob smashes the door down
    and comes for her, they take her, they pull her away from the
    children....
2   EXT. PLACE DE CONCORDE - DAY
    MARIE-ANTOINETTE goes straight into a wagon. Peripheral
    threatening violence. Stay with them in the streets into
    Place de Concorde....
                          NAPOLEON (VO)
              Those at the top are poor creatures.
              It must be admitted when you see
              things at first hand, that the
              people are not worth the trouble
              taken in winning their favor....
    In the crowd of people, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
                          NAPOLEON (VO)
              You have to see things c lose to
              realize that enthusiasm is but
              enthusiasm and the French are an old
              nation without ties......
3   EXT. PLACE DE CONCORDE - DAY
    Marie-Antoinette lead up to the guillotine.
                          ROBESPIERRE (VO)
              She was guilty of three charges
              against you. Depletion of the
              national treasury, conspiracy
              against the internal and external
              security of State and high treason
              for acting in the interest of the
              Enemy.
    They cut off her head. Sanson holds her head up, PEOPLE
    CHEER.

    TITLE: THE REPUBLIC
                                                           2.


                          ROBESPIERRE (VO)
              ...Indulgence of the Royalists, cry
              certain men, mercy for the villains!
              No! Mercy for the innocent, mercy
              for the weak, mercy for the
              unfortunate, mercy for humanity....
4   INT. JACOBIN CLUB - DAY
    Robespierre is giving a speech. Napoleon and his friends
    Saliceti and Junot are in the crowd, listening.
                          ROBESPIERRE (VO)
              Society owes protection only to
              peaceable citizens. Terror is
              nothing other than justice. Prompt,
              severe, inflexible: it is therefore
              an emanation of virtue....
    Above, in the gallery sits PAUL BARRAS (male 30s, effeminate)
    Lucien and Barras see each other, motions him to an upstairs
    gallery.
5   INT. JACOBIN CLUB - UPSTAIRS - LATER
    A corner heated by a stove. Robespierre speech heard OC.
    Barras meets Napoleon and Lucien. Barras is gossiping with
    them:
                          PAUL BARRAS
              The New Republic has promised to
              assist all people who rise up
              against their rulers which has put
              us to war with all Europe and the
              English. I believe we have shown
              that we are incompetent to wage a
              war against anyone. Don't
              you......?
    REVEAL: NAPOLEON, is standin g next to his brother LUCIEN and
    they are listening to Barras. Napoleon doesn't answer.
                           LUCIEN
              Yes.
                          PAUL BARRAS
              It is clear to The New Committee and
              Anyone Else that we are incompetent -
              I'm not saying anything impressive,
              I'm just possessing an honest
              appraisal of the Current Situation -
              You were posted in Auxonne during
              the Revolution?
                          NAPOLEON
              Yes.
                          PAUL BARRAS
              Suppressing local food riots?
                                         3.


              NAPOLEON
Yes.
            PAUL BARRAS
You organized a volunteer National
Guard in Corsica?
              NAPOLEON
Yes.
            PAUL BARRAS
The English now occupy your home of
Corsica?
              NAPOLEON
Yes.
              PAUL BARRAS
Mmhm.        Where is your family?
              NAPOLEON
Marseilles.
            PAUL BARRAS
Dependent on your pay?
              NAPOLEON
yes.
              LUCIEN
Citizen   Bonaparte as artillery
officer   has organized heated shots
for the   coastal batteries to fire at
English   ships.
            PAUL B ARRAS
Mmmm.    Heated shots.
The British Navy have taken the port
of Toulon. Half the French fleet is
trapped there.
Lucky for us, Admiral Pitt sent the
bulk of his English army to die in
the West Indies of yellow fever so
there are only two thousand English
troops in Toulon.
But we are short of artillery and we
are led by a General who was a court
painter. A painter. F ruit.
            NAPOLEON
It's not necessary to recapture
Toulon itself. The town is not a
town. The town is a port.
If the harbour is untenable to the
English fleet, the town must
surrender.
                                                           4.


                           PAUL BARRAS
               and how do you take the Harbour?
                           NAPOLEON
               Take the Fort that dominates the
               Harbour and you have the city.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               I, for one, think we should despair
               and abandon the whole Provence to
               the English Invader...
                   (***ALTERNATIVE LINE
                    FORTHCOMING***)

5A   EXT. PORT OF TOULON - MORNING
     Napoleon and Junot ride in.

6    INT. FRENCH WAR BASE NEAR TOULON - MORNING
     PULL BACK to see French General JEAN-FRANCOIS CARTEAUX,
     painting a still life of fruit. We're in his quarters within
     an old fort.
     Napoleon stands, unnoticed and watches him paint.
     General Carteaux motions without turning.
                           GEN. CARTEAUX
               You're in my light....pass the burnt
               umber...
     CU. NAPOLEON
     Seeing the situation. (passes the burnt umber)

7    EXT. PORT OF TOULON - MORNING
     Napoleon walking amongst/over his shabby troops. French
     INFANTRYMEN lie on the ground.
8    EXT. PORT OF TOULON - DAY
     A WIDE SHOT that reveals the geography of the
     situation...it's a large port blockaded by British Naval
     Vessels with a FORT L'EGUILETTE occupying the promontory.
     There are British Flags everywhere.
9    INT. TOULON WAR CAMP - ARTILLERY ROOM - DAY
     Napoleon pulls back a tarp to survey the RUSTED OUT CANNONS
     in the back of an oxcart....
10   EXT. TOULON - DAY
     Napoleon, dressed in the clothes of a carpenter, rides an old
     work-horse as British troops strut past him.
                                                              5.


     He stops and casts a surreptitious glance over his shoulder
     to be sure he isn't being watched. He pulls out a spyglass.
     HIS POV: the main fort overlooking the city, FORT
     L'EGUILETTE, with British and Bourbon flags flying overhead.
11   EXT. FORT L'EGUILETTE - DAY
     Napoleon rides along the wall beneath the great fortress.
     High above, along the fortress wall, British SOLDIERS are
     running out and panning the great LONG CANNONS.
     Napoleon watches closely, unnoticed. As Napoleon watches
     closely, one of the soldiers steps on the wall --
     -- and sends a scree of loose stone tumbling down below,
     making Napoleon's workhorse whinny and dance.
                           BRITISH SOLDIER
               Sorry about that, mate!


12   EXT. MUDDY BANK/ BEACH - MONTAGE -- DAY
     A RIVER BANK, pockmarked with blast craters from cannon and
     mortar fire. Napoleon plunges a shovel into the mud --
     -- and finds it buried within: an old CANNONBALL, warped out
     of shape by the force of impact. He tosses it into a
     wheelbarrow full of scrap metal. His men are doing the same,
     digging up rusty mortars and other metal debris.
     A DONKEY tethered to a rope pulls a rusted old anchor fro m
     the river bank where it is buried.

13   EXT. WAR CAMP - DAY
     The men build LADDERS wide enough for two men to climb
     abreast.

14   INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - MONTAGE - DAY
     Piles of stolen scrap iron are poured out of brigands' bags
     into the great glowing forge, where they melt into molten
     taffy --
     -- which is poured into a series of molds in the shape of
     CANNONS and cannonballs.
     MORTARS are assembled -- small cannons, three feet long, that
     can be carried and swiveled to lob grenades.
     We PUSH IN on Bonaparte standing at the center of it all,
     drenched in sweat as he pou rs the molten iron into the molds.
                                                            6.


     A HISS OF STEAM as water is poured over the cannon molds to
     cool them. Bonaparte reaches in with a set of heavy tongs and
     picks up one of the glowing 2-pound balls.
15   EXT. FORGE -- TOULON - CAMP -- DAY
     A line of freshly forged MORTARS stand before us on wooden
     tripods.
     Napoleon takes a new mortar casting of at least 80 pounds and
     rests it in its cradle. Takes a pinch of powder and
     saltpeter... points to the distant wall... then inserts an
     explosive ball.
     Napoleon drives a RAMMER SHAFT into the bore of a cannon,
     demonstrating for a group of raw recruits. Barras, Carteaux
     and Junot are in conferen ce in the BG nearby.
     The mortar FIRES and clears the wall.

16   EXT. FORT L'EGUILETTE -- NIGHT (DECEMBER 16, 1793)
     Napoleon and his men move under cover of darkness.
     THIRTY MORTAR CREWS, each consisting of three men apiece,
     maneuver the mortars into position on the battlefield.
     In the distance, British GUARDS carouse and sing songs on the
     Fortress rooftop not 200 yards away. A drunken guard appears
     and urinates off the parapet.
     A muster of 200 FRENCH TROOPS are ready: thirty three-man
     MORTAR CREWS, each wi th its own mortar on a tripod, along
     with 100 MARKSMEN with bayonets and rifles waiting by the
     large door to be blown up. The ladder troops wait at the
     ready.
     A SAPPER has set a keg of powder by the back door to the
     fortress. He rolls a coil of fuse away into darkness.
     Napoleon signals -- and a FLAGMAN using two white flags uses
     semaphore to signal the Sapper. The fuse is lit -- the fuse
     runs down --
     -- and the Fortress door is BLOWN OPEN in a huge EXPLOSION --
     -- as all the mortars are launched simultaneously at the
     fortress, killing many of the guards on the roof.

17   INT. CASTLE BARRACKS -- SAME
     British MARINES grab their rifles from beside their bunks and
     run outside in their stocking feet and long underwear --
                                                            7.


18   EXT. FORTRESS ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
     -- and charge outside onto to the rooftop, blindly returning
     fire into the darkness.
     The French Infantry are already at the wall with their
     ladders. They scale the ladders two abreast, gaining access
     to the fortress roof.
     Barras, Carteaux and Junot watch from the rear as - Napoleon
     trots forward alongside them with his foot soldiers.
     Everywhere there is shouting, smoke.
                             NAPOLEON
               Cease Fire.
     A soldier uses SEMAPHORE to signal his cannon crews to cease
     fire as the grenadiers break onto the roof and set about the
     British.
     BULLETS whizz around Barras and Carteaux.
     Napoleon's horse dances nervously amidst the gunfire.
     Barras and Napoleon have a moment amidst the chaos together:
                           NAPOLEON
               (at last I am at war)
     Napoleon spurs his horse towards the wall.
     At that moment a random 2-pound CANNONBALL from the parapet
     hits Napoleon's horse full in the chest. The animal
     practically liquefies, disintegrating in pieces beneath him,
     before it spins & falls, pinning Napoleon's leg to the
     ground.
     Barras and Junot leap off their horses, taking Napoleon by
     the arms and pulling him out from under the liquefied horse.
     Barras and Napoleon look at one another, stunned. Barras and
     Napoleon are covered in blood. He g ets up...
     Napoleon has drawn his saber and charges the fort on foot.
     Barras watches as Napoleon climbs the ladder, then disappears
     into the bloody chaos
     Napoleon appears on the battlement, his saber drawn. All is
     smoke and chaos.
     A RED-FACED IRISH SERGEANT charges him with his bayonet,
     roaring with anger, or more likely, terror. Napoleon assumes
     his best fencer's stance and parries his blade --
     -- but t he Irishman swings around and comes back with his
     rifle butt. Napoleon ducks the bayonet, slashing at the
     Irishman's side, opening up a huge wound.
     Napoleon returns to his stance, saber drawn, and offers the
     hemorrhaging Irishman his scarf.
                                                             8.


                            IRISHMAN
                Little Ponce! Fecking shite on yer
                rag!
      The Irishman makes a charge and gores Napoleon in the leg.
      Napoleon instantly collapses.
      The Irishman raises his bayonet to spear Napoleon --
      -- as a footsoldier sweeps past, killing the Irishman with
      his saber. The Irishman falls dead beside him, their faces
      inches apart.
      Napoleon struggles to his feet and limps to the wall of the
      Fort overlooking the Toulon harbor --
      -- where the heavy guns are being taken over. The British
      guards are being thrown from the walls. The mortars are now
      off loading onto the small French fleet moored below the
      Castle. Napoleon stands beside the big guns.
                            NAPOLEON
                Fire cannons!
      The CANNONS FIRE at Hood's Fleet offshore --
18A   EXT. PORT OF TOULON - HARBOUR
      See the fleet offshore, clearly in chaos
19    EXT. FORT L'EGUILETTE -- NIGHT
      Napoleon stalks up and down the line of cannons, he rolls a
      cannonball to one of the crews. A big fellow picks it up to
      load.
      Barras and Generals Carteaux and Junot are watching from the
      castle platform as Napoleon directs the fire, drenched in
      blood, backlit with the fire he created.
      The British ships are pulling away from the harbor moorings.
      Some are burning and setting fire to other ships.
      Napo leon walks back to the line of mortars. In the BG, one of
      Hood's ship EXPLODES as its magazine is struck by a
      cannonball. Barras sees Napoleon with new eyes.
                            BARRAS
                That man has a gift.
20    EXT. TOULON - DAY
      Napoleon is awarded title of Brigadier-General in a small,
      make-shift ceremony of some kind that's very low budget and
      thrown together. Junot and Carteaux are here chosen as
      Aides. Barras presents him with a ribbon and a fraternal hug.
                            PAUL BARRAS
                (Into Napoleon's ear)
                Whether you're a madman or a
                genius...
                            (MORE)
                                                          9.

                           PAUL BARRAS (CONT'D)
               (To the Crowd)
               On behalf of The National Convention
               and the Committees, I award you the
               rank of Brigadier-General.
                           NAPOLEON
               I promised you brilliant successes,
               and I have kept my word.
     OFF NAPOLEON....
                           JACQUES LOUIS-DAVID
               Who has visited you?
                           LITTLE HORTENSE
               My Aunt.
                           JACQUES LOUIS-DAVID
               What letters have you received?

21   INT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - PARIS
     A YOUNG HORTENSE BEAUHARNAIS (10 yrs) is being interrogated
     by Jacobin thugs: CITIZEN LACOMBE & JACQUES. Five of them
     crowd a small kitchen. JOSEPHINE BEAUHARNAIS is kept quiet,
     scared off to the side watching her daughter under
     questioning.
                           JOSEPHINE
               She's a child - stop it, I will tell
               you what you want - stop talking to
               her and talk to me --
                           JACQUES LOUIS-DAVID
               Don't look at your Mother, look at
               me. (to Guards) Take her in the
               other room....
                           JOSEPHINE
               I'm here, my love, I'm in the next
               room, I can hear you --
                           JOSEPHINE
               It's alright, my love....
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               Do you know your Father's under
               arrest?
                           HORTENSE
               He's a prisoner.
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               Do you know why?
                           HORTENSE
               Because he's a noble.
                                                          10.


                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               What do you want to do to his
               jailers?
                           HORTENSE
               I want him to come back.
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               Are you a Noble?
                           HORTENSE
               Yes?
     ON JOSEPHINE, crying in the other room.
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE (OC)
               Do you love Liberty?
                           HORTENSE
               Yes.
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               What do your parents say about
               Royalty?

               Come now, don't be shy, what do they
               say when they speak about Louis and
               Marie-Antoinette.
                           HORTENSE
               My father is for the Revolution. So
               Am I.
                           CITIZEN LACOMBE
               Don't lie to me or I will hurt you:
               What will your Mother do to your
               Father's jailer....?

               STAY MY CHILDREN. STAY SAFE, STAY IN
               THE HOME. I WILL RETURN.
     She struggles into the cart and is taken off.
                                                           11.


23   EXT/INT. CARMES PRISON - DAY
     Establish shot that brings Josephine and other aristocrats
     and clergy to Carmes Prison. They are herded inside.
     Josephine stands before a Female Warder who takes her rings
     and yanks her earrings off.
                           FEMALE WARDER
               Show me your hands. Open your
               mouth.
     Reveal Josephine's Teeth, pale, grey and decayed.
                           JOSEPHINE
               I am a citizen of the Republic.
               I have a right to a trial.
     She is moved along, comes in to a courtyard and finds an old
     friend: THERESA CABARRUS. They embrace.


24   INT. CARMES PRISON - LATER
     Theresa and Josephine in a hallway, sat on the floor, people
     crowded around.   An open door nearby has a couple having
     sex. Josephine looks to Theresa trying to understand.
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               They won't execute a pregnant woman.
     CU. JOSEPHINE
                           THERESA CABARRUS (CONT'D)
               And men never need a reason to fuck,
               do they?


25   INT. CARMES PRISON -- COURTYARD -- DAY
     The condemned aristocrats are all socializing in the
     courtyard. Their clothes are dirty, their wigs askew, but
     they continue to act as if it's a garden party.
     Josephine, seated with Theresa who has a short hair cut and
     gestures to that:
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               They say the blade of the guillotine
               can get caught in your hair.....
                          JOSEPHINE
               It's true. I watched them behead
               the King. The blade got stuck in
               his neck.
                                                          12.


                           THERESA CABARRUS
               His neck was fat. You have the neck
               of a swan, you won't feel a thing.
                           JOSEPHINE
               The head falls in the basket, and
               the executioner holds it up for the
               crowd. The eyes blink, and the lips
               move. Everybody listens to hear
               what they're saying. Is that the
               last thing you see? The crowd
               looking back at you, laughing?
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               ...
                           JOSEPHINE
               I need a knife. Can you get one?
                           THERE SA CABARRUS
                   (firmly)
               I'm not going to die. I'll do what
               it takes. If that means getting
               pregnant, so be it.
     Theresa turns and glances across the courtyard, where the
     young men are gathered.
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               You can die like a lady. Or you can
               live, like me.
     Theresa rises and crosses the courtyard to join the men.
     Amongst them is LAZARE HOCHE, a handsome young military
     officer. Josephine's gaze meets Hoche's... and in him she
     glimpses a way to stay alive.
26   INT. CARMES PRISON - JOSEPHINE'S CELL - NIGHT
     She picks up a knife and begins to cut off all her hair.
27   INT. CARMES PRISON -- CORRIDORS - NIGHT
     Josephine walks through the halls, past the cells of the
     condemned.
28   INT. CARMES PRISON - LAZARE HOCHE'S CELL - NIGHT
     She appears. Lazare Hoche sits up and sees her. She removes
     her dress.....
29   OMITTED
30   EXT. PLACE DE CONCORDE - DAY
     Condemned people wait in the tumbrels to be executed. A group
     of Nuns is amongst them, praying.   The Eldest Nun is walked
     up and the Crowd falls quiet at the sight of this.....
                                                           13.


      As she climbs up, she begins to sing Veni Creator Spiritus..
      She is executed.
      The other Nuns are singing.
      Finally, there is one young Nun left, she fearlessly kneels
      and lays her head on the block, singing. She gets her head
      chopped off and everyone is quiet.......
                              VOICE
                ENOUGH.....
      Lots of murmurs and sadness. "ENOUGH" calls here and there.


30A   INT. BARRAS OFFICE - NIGHT
      Napoleon sits in a hush-hush conversation with Barras over a
      glass of brandy.
                             BARRAS
                I would say the current leadership
                of France has passed from enthusiasm
                to reckless ambition..........and
                that the public perception of the
                guillotine is lawless passion led by
                Robspierre.           He is unfit to
                rule...and if it is not his head in
                a basket, then sooner or later it
                will be any one of us who have
                s erved under his title..........
      Napoleon stays quiet and still.
30B   INT. JACOBIN CLUB - DAY (JULY 27, 1794)
      Robespierre's moment has come. He is sat and silenced. His
      main associates in the reign of terror are nearby: Wheelchair
      Couthon, Pretty Boy Saint-Just and Brother Augistin
      Robespierre, Le Bas.
      Plotters attack his character and his thirst for power.
      BARRAS sits and watches the chaos unfolding. EVERYONE IS
      SHOUTING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER, ROBSPIERRE is not allowed to
      speak:
                            PLOTTER
                It is has become increasingly clear,
                Citizen Robespierre that your
                motivations are to use this blade to
                your ultimate power.
                            ROBESPIERRE
                Let me speak, let me speak, sir, no
                man in this room has objected to my
                methods � if you say I'm guilty, you
                are all guilty.
                                                           14.


                            PLOTTER
                You are Roman tyrant...worse than
                Ceaser.
                            CROWD
                VARIOUS AD LIBS. TYRANT. CAESAR.
                            ROBSPIERRE
                YOU are the traitors. YOU ARE, ALL
                OF YOU THE TRAITORS, LET ME SPEAK.
                            BARRIS
                YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY DEFENDER OF
                FREEDOM. YOU HAVE DEEMED YOURSELF
                JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER, HAVE
                YOU NOT? HAVE YOU NOT? ANSWER MY
                QUESTION.
      HE STANDS AND LOOKS TO HIS DEPUTIES:
                             ROBSPIERRE
                I am appealing to you, men of
                purity , men of virtue � defend my
                name �
                              BARRAS
                ARREST HIM.
      Robespierre starts to move away and then makes a RUN FOR IT
      AND BEDLAM COMES QUICKLY:
      Barras and Crowd are hot on Robespierre's heels, following
      him up stairs and into a balcony.
      Wheelchair Couthon goes down a flight of stairs.
      Barras and the Jacobins trample Couthon as they run upstairs.
30C   INT. JACOBIN CLUB -- GALLERY -- SAME
      Barras barges a door to find Robespierre standing there with
      a pistol. Robespierre aims the pistol at Barras' heart.
      Robespierre FIRES one of the guns which doesn't go off...he
      takes the other and aims at his own head --
      -- the bullet enters at an off-angle, shooting him in the
      jaw. There's cloud of smoke and blood. Robespierre collapses
      to the ground, writhing.
                              BARRAS (CONT'D)
                You missed.
      Barras tur ns to the Jacobins.
                              BARRAS (CONT'D)
                Take him.
      Half his jaw has been blown off, he's still alive.
                                                              15.


30D   EXT. PLACE DE CONCORDE -- DAY (JULY 28, 1794)
      And so it is that Maximilien Robespierre is delivered up to
      his own guillotine. His shattered jaw is bandaged. Jacques-
      Louis David is there, sketching Robespierre in his
      sketchbook.
      Sanson slides Robespierre's head into the Lunette and tears
      off the bandage on his jaw. Robespierre SCREAMS.
      The Lunette is closed, the lever pulled. The blade falls.

31    EXT. CARMES PRISON -- DAY
      The gates of the prison are opened. Josephine and Theresa
      walk outside into the silent streets of Paris, followed by a
      procession of bewildered aristocrats.
      Everywhere grand homes are in ruins, stripped for firewood.
      Outside them, homeless Parisians cook food over campfires of
      burning paintings and antiques.
32    EXT. PARIS STREETS - MORNING
      It's the very sad morning after in the Paris streets.
      Empty and lonely in transition. Small figure cross an empty
      square.


33    INT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - PARIS
      Josephine comes back home to an empty home.....stripped of
      valuables and full of refuse.
      She moves through every room.....calling out for her
      children....... The dog scampers down to her, recognizing his
      mistress. Lucille, her maidservant appears, carrying an axe.
      She nearly takes a swing at Josephine when they recognize
      each other.
      Young Hortense and Young Eugene emerge from the attic where
      t hey've been hiding.
                              HORTENSE/EUGENE
                Mama!
      An emotional reunion.
      MUSIC UP OVER:

34    EXT. PARIS STREETS - DUSK - SUMMER 1794
      The streets are alive with music floating from open windows
      and couples dancing the waltz -- the latest craze.
                                                           16.


     Street musicians play; vendors sell their wares; people get
     drunk at street cafes.
     Into this scene drifts Napoleon, in his Brigadier General's
     uniform with his comrade Junot.
     THREE WOMEN drift down the street, wearing diaphanous
     Romanesque tunics that reveal every curve of their bodies.
     The entire street parts for the women as they approach.
     They wear red ribbons around their throats and their ha ir cut
     as if for the guillotine.
                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               The ladies are everywhere and the
               men are mad about them. Men think
               of nothing else and live only for
               and through them. A woman needs six
               months in Paris to know what is her
               due and her Empire......
35   OMITTED
36   INT. BAL DES VICTIMES/THE VICTIM'S BALL - NIGHT
     TITLE: PARIS, SUMMER, 1794
     Napoleon and Junot step into a party of candle-lit decadence
     and champagne. People gamble, smoke, drink and waltz. Women
     in transparent gowns. Lavish and pleasure. Junot wanders
     off. Napoleon finds his way to a long table and watches from
     a safe distance:
     Music is being played by a naked quartet.

     THERESA CABARRUS cavorts before PAUL BARRAS at the head of a
     table. S he is wearing a tiger's pelt belted at her waist.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               May I ask you a question?
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               Yes, Citizen Barras.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               Does Your Dress Bite?
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               Yes, it does bite.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               Would it devour me?
                           THERESA CABARRUS
               Yes I believe it would if you tried
               to touch it.....
               Would you like to tempt it?
                                                         17.


                       PAUL BARRAS
           Does your beast have a name?
BEAT: Theresa settles on his lap
                       THERESA CABARRUS
           No, my beast does not have a name.
           But you may name her "Government
           Property" if you like.
Napoleon watches the scene......he drifts away...
ANOTHER ROOM:
A Gavotte is being played, couples dance and others play
cards for high stakes. Napoleon finds himself standing
looking at a nearby card table............
......here sits a woman wearing a translucent dress that reveals
the curves of her body, powdered makeup, and a red ribbon
around her throat.
It is JOSEPHINE. She's playing cards for high stakes and
losing.
Napoleon stares at her, Josephine plays and loses, catches
Napoleon's eye from time to time, staring creepy at her...The
dealer turns over a card.
                       DEALER
           A seven, Madame.
                          JOSEPHINE
           Deal again.
                          DEALER
           Seven again.
She loses. Jose phine's money is removed by the Dealer, people
standing around watching murmur and hide amusement of the
loss. Napoleon watching, Josephine gives him a last flick of
her eyes and then back to speaking with her young female
companion as she leaves the group and walks straight to him:
                       JOSEPHINE
           Why are you staring at me?
                       NAPOLEON
           Why are you wearing that costume?
                       JOSEPHINE
           This is the Victim's Ball. We drink
           and make love because we're about to
           die.
Napoleon gazes at Josephine.
                       JOSEPHINE
           What is your costume?
                                                           18.


                            NAPOLEON
                Madame, this is a uniform.
                            JOSEPHINE
                Your uniform?
                            NAPOLEON
                I am a Brigadier General.
                I led the French victory at Toulon.
      HOLD, THEN:
37    INT. BAL DES VICTIMES/THE VICTIMS' BALL -- LATER
      Guests seated to watch a performance. Onstage, the actors
      perform a burlesque song-and-dance for a rapt audience.
      A woman dressed as Death wearing skull makeup, a black cowl
      and nothing else is flirting with a man dressed as the Devil.
      Napoleon and Junot watching the show. Napoleon sees, across
      the room, Barras exchanging kisses with a woman on his lap
      that, on second glance, is a man in a woma n's clothing.
      Josephine is seated next to Barras and gazes at Napoleon. He
      leans over and whispers something to her, then looks back to
      the stage. Onstage the burlesque stage has turned to a sex
      show.
      Josephine gives Napoleon one last quick look, then leaves
      with Barras and the trans-woman - a threesome.
37A   INT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - NIGHT
      A couple has loud sex, there are mirrors strategically
      arranged, the woman astride the man; GROANS, then laughter.
      The woman rolls onto her back, spent -- it's Josephine and
      Paul Barras is her lover. He offers her a sip from his glass
      of champagne.
                            JOSEPHINE
                I met the strangest man tonight.
                Your Bonaparte.
                             BARRAS
                He may be odd, but he has a way with
                cannonballs. He thinks like an
                artist, real ly. I've taken him
                under my wing.
                            JOSEPHINE
                You're sure he's a genius?
                            BARRAS
                I'm betting on it. Speaking of
                which, you ran up a debt at cards
                tonight. I'll pay it this time, but
                --
                                                             19.


                           JOSEPHINE
               I need more than that.   You know my
               situation.
                           BARRAS
               You live fashionably.
                           JOSEPHINE
               I have to remain fashionable. To
               have me as a lover -- it's made your
               reputation in the salons, Paul. I
               should really ask for more.
     Barras mulls this over.   Josephine's killing his mood.
                           BARRAS
               This will keep you afloat for now --
     He reaches for his billfold and offers her a sheaf of
     Assignat notes -- the n snatches it away.
                           BARRAS (CONT'D)
               -- but you should get to know
               Bonaparte better.
     She takes the money, counts it, and tucks it away; she's all
     business.
                           JOSEPHINE
               Maybe I will.
38   INT. NAPOLEON'S BARRACKS - DAY
     Napoleon at work. Maps, papers, etc. Half dozen Military
     Aides. JUNOT enters.
                           JUNOT
               General Bonaparte, there is a very
               young man who wishes to see you, his
               name is Eugene Beauharnais.
     Napoleon looks up as the 13 year old EUGENE enters the room
                           EUGENE
               General Bonaparte.
                           NAPOLEON
               Yes.
                           EUGENE
               I am Citizen Eugene Beauharnais.

                           NAPOLEON
               What do you want?
                           EUGENE
               My father's saber. It was taken from
               him before he was arrested and
               executed.
                                                           20.


                            NAPOLEON
               Yes.
                           EUGENE
               It would mean a great deal to me,
               and to my mother, if it were
               returned to us. It's all we have
               of him.
                           NAPOLEON
               The sword is a weapon. I cannot
               allow citizens of Paris to have
               weapons in their possession.
                           EUGENE
               The sword is a keepsake for me to
               remember my dear late father.
                           NAPOLEON
               Perhaps, but it is a weapon
               nevertheless.
               Why are you here, young man?
                           EUGENE
               My mother said that you w ere the
               only man of authority to retrieve
               the sword.

39   INT. COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- STORAGE ROOM -- DAY
     Napoleon throws open the door. The room is filled with
     hundreds of tarnished Republican Army Sabers -- in piles, in
     great bins, on shelves. They are all identical.
                           CLERK
               All of these are from officers who
               were sentenced to die.
                           NAPOLEON
               Does no one think to attach a name
               to any of them?
     Indeed, some clerk did as he gestures to hundreds of sabers.
                           NAPOLEON
               Bring me a feather and Indian ink.
40   INT. CHATEA U DE BEAUHARNAIS - DAY
     Napoleon is waiting in the foyer holding the saber.
     Eugene comes to see him.   Napoleon presents the saber to
     Eugene.
     The boy's eyes well up with tears.
                                                          21.


     Until Eugene draws the blade to see another name. He looks
     at Napoleon who imperceptibly shakes his head, as if to say,
     `don't.'
     Napoleon looks up to see Hortense, watching from the second
     floor.   He bows. She nods her head. He says:
                           NAPOLEON
               Come down here.
     She comes down....
                           NAPOLEON
               Is there reason to introduce myself?
                           JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
               No, General.............
     He looks back up to the top of the stairs and sees: Josephine
                            NAPOLEON
               Good.

     Josephine comes down, Napoleon bows gallantly.
                           NAPOLEON
               My compliments to the chef of this
               fine family.......


41   EXT. PARIS SQUARE - EVENING
     The park is filled with flaneurs, homeless peasants and
     prostitutes, upper class are venturing out. Nonetheless, the
     trees are in full bloom as Napoleon and Josephine take a seat
     at a cafe table.
                           NAPOLEON
               I don't feel the need to fill this
               space with words.......
                           JOSEPHINE
               ........no............
     She stares at him.   He leans in to kiss her.

43   INT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - BEDROOM - EVENING
     Josephine sits in the twilight at her bedroom makeup table.
     Her foundation makeup is made of lead paint, as all makeup
     was at the time.
                                                          22.


     A candelabra is brought to the table by LUCILLE, seeing the
     painted face as harsh.
     She smiles -- her teeth are grey, decayed from a childhood
     spent sucking on sugar cane. She touches them painfully.
     Josephine takes turpentine solution to remove the makeup,
     reveals her face unpainted, very beautiful.
                           JOSEPHINE
               Should I look like I'm in love?
                           LUCILLE
               I cannot say.
                           JOSEPHINE
               You would know.
                            LUCILLE
               Do yo u find him without appeal?
                           JOSEPHINE
               No.
                           LUCILLE
               Then perhaps that is enough.
                           JOSEPHINE
               I am indifferent and lukewarm. But
               he will take me....and in a fight he
               will win...and no matter what my
               charms have been in the past to men,
               I'm afraid I won't be able to hold
               this one's attraction.
                           LUCILLE
               Don't underestimate your grace.
                            JOSEPHINE
               I can see the future....and in it,
               he will need more than I can
               pr ovide......
     She turns back to the mirror and we start her VOICE OVER
     HERE:
                            JOSEPHINE (VO)
               If after our union he should cease
               to love me, will he not reproach me
               with what he will have sacrificed
               for my sake?


44   INT. RUE DU MAIL - 2ND ARRONDISSEMENT - DAY
     Napoleon receives a card written in Josephine's flowing
     script: an invitation to her home. He holds it to his nose
     and breathes her perfume.
                                                          23.


45   EXT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - DAY
     The door opens. Napoleon bows deeply. Josephine awaits him,
     her face painted, dressed in her lace.   They meet.

46   INT. CHATEAU DE BEAUHARNAIS - BEDROOM � DAY
     Napoleon and Josephine staring at each other, tea in front of
     them. Lucille tinkers with some crockery and then leaves
                           JOSEPHINE
               Do you see an aristocrat when you
               look at me?
                             NAPOLEON
               No.
                           JOSEPHINE
               My husband had more than one lover
               and when his head was cut off his
               mistresses watched.
               When I was in Prison I was told the
               only way to survive was to get
               pregnant. So....General.....
               Do I need to warn you of my
               indiscretions?
                             NAPOLEON
               No, madame.
                           JOSEPHINE
               Does where I have been concern you?
                             NAPOLEON
               No, madame.
     HOLD. SILENT MOVIE SCENE. LOOKS.
                             JOSEPHINE
               If you look down, I will show you a
               surprise... and once you see it you
               will always want it.
     He looks down and she opens her legs........
47   EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY
     Napoleon and Junot in the streets, walking past a growing
     gathering of Royalist's making SPEECHES, HOLDING SIGNS,
     GROWING LOUDER. "Long Live The King!"
                           ROYAL SUPPORTER
               THEY HAVE PROVEN CORRUPT. UNABLE TO
               SEE THE POWER THAT THEY HOLD.
               CITIZENS OF PARIS, DON'T BE FOOLED.
               THERE ARE MORE OF US. WE CAN OCCUPY

     Napoleon and Junot head down the street, past the mob --

48   INT. BARRAS OFFICE - DAY
     Paul Barras is very concerned, Napoleon comes in...
                           PAUL BARRAS
               What took so long? Come in, sit down
               - are you alone?
                           NAPOLEON
               Junot is just outside.   We are
               alone.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               Listen to me, the situation seems to
               be growing.
                           NAPOLEON
               Yes.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               There is a belief amongst the
               Committee that there is an attack on
               the Council coming by this mob....
               General Menou has been dismissed of
               his command. and I have been asked
               to Defend it....
                           NAPOLEON
               ....yes....so how may I help you?
               Paul, you must tell me more
               information to help you.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               I don't know the slightest place to
               start. I have less than 4,000
               troops and very little in the way of
               weapons.
                           NAPOLEON
               There are 40 cannons at Sablons.
               I can have them here in three hours.
                           PAUL BARRAS
               Yes, but mathematically...this mob
               is 20,000 strong .
                           NAPOLEON
               Yes.
                                                             25.


                           PAUL BARRAS
               What would you intend to do if this
               assignment of defense was
               transferred to you? As my second in
               command, of course...
                           NAPOLEON
               I accept on the condition that I
               command this as I see fit without
               interruption. I will not lead as
               second-in-command.

49   EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY
     A standoff outside the Convention. A mob of 20,000 vs.
     Napoleon's 40 cannons and General Davout awaiting orders.     At
     the slightest movement.........
     Napoleon gives the order to fire, in what seems to come
     completely out of the blue. He has instantly killed many
     hundreds of Royalists and everyone else runs away.


50   INT. BARRAS OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT
     Drinks all around, everyone's happy, Napoleon speaks:
                           NAPOLEON
               ...to a mob who are ignorant of
               firearms, it is the worst possible
               policy to start out by firing
               blanks. Hearing a great noise -
               they are frightened - but looking
               around and seeing no one killed or
               wounded - they begin to despise you.
               They become twice as insolent and
               rush without fear. It then becomes
               necessary to kill ten times th e
               number of men.
               It would have been a waste of life
               to fire blanks.
     Barras silently toasts Napoleon, a penny for his thoughts...

51   INT. CIVIL MARRIAGE SERVICE - PARIS - DAY (MARCH 9, 1796)

     Witnesses are: Paul Barras, Hortense and Eugene. The

               marriage which he might have

                           JOSEPHINE (VO) (CONT'D)
               What shall then I reply? I shall
               weep.
               And this will serve no end........
                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               May my good genius surround you,
               enfold you, while I face my fate
               unguarded. May your soul be free
               from worries, as your body from
               illness....
     As they are announced man and wife, congratulations and
     kisses all around, Napoleon sweeping up Eugene and Hortense
     as his own.
                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               Every moment separates m e further
               from you, my beloved, and every
               moment I have less energy to exist
               so far from you. To live for
               Josephine, that is the history of my
               life.


52   EXT. MILAN DUOMO � DAY (MAY 15, 1796)

     TITLE: CONQUEST OF ITALY   - 1796
                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               I am struggling to get near you, I
               am dying to be by your side, fool
               that I am, I fail t o realize how far
               off I am, that lands separate us.

               General, these are Italian
               paintings.   They belong to Italy.
               We are proud people, General.
                           NAPOLEON
               Yes, you are a proud people, but you
               have not shown skill to defend
               yourself. How can you be trusted to
               defend this artwork?

     is at the table, listening to Hippolyte tell a joke/story. He
     is a skilled mimic.
     Josephine listens avidly...Hippolyte is very entertaining.
58   INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
     Napoleon humping Josephine like a rabbit....he finishes
     quickly and triumphantly says:
                           NAPOLEON
               Let that work make us a son!
     ANGLE, LATER
     They lay together:
                           JOSEPHINE
               is this what will happen from now
               on?
                           NAPOLEON
               what?
                           JOSEPHINE
               I will marry you and you will leave,
               And each time you leave, I have no
               assurance of your return.
                           NAPOLEON
               My sweet Josephine, the only thing
               you can depend on in this world is
               my return.

60    EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - DAY (JULY 1798)
      Napoleon stands alone atop his white charger beneath a
      towering Sphinx. He gazes up at it with wonder,
      REVERSE ANGLE: The great desert beyond.
      REVEAL 60,000 FRENCH TROOPS marching in columns behind him.
      GENERALS DUMAS, DESAIX, KLEBER and Josephine's son: EUGENE
      (now 20 years old)
                            NAPOLEON
                Where is my boy??
      Eugene rides up next to Napoleon.   They share the wonder
      together.
                            NAPOLEON
                I wish your Mother could see what we
                are seeing. I cherish this time
                with you.

61    EXT. THE PYRAMIDS - DAY
      Thousands of MAMELUKES -- an assemblage of Mid-eastern and
      Ukrainian mercenaries on horseback -- have assembled at the
      foot of the pyramids.
      Napoleon and his troops are arrayed at 300 meters opposite
      the Mamelukes. They are greatly outnumbered. Napoleon and
      JUNOT, his second- in-command.
      The Mameluke CHIEFTAIN has broken from his own front line. He
      raises his scimitar over his head and swings it in great
      circles as he gallops backwards and forwards - a ferocious,
      intimidating display. Finally, he points his sword at
      Napoleon, much grandstanding.
                            NAPOLEON
                Fire one and two.
      Two LARGE CANNONS FIRE from behind the Napoleon. As the
      cannonballs sail over the heads of the Mamelukes --
      -- and clips the tops of the Pyramids, removing the peaks of
      the ancient monument.
      The Mameluke's HORSE bucks, nearl y dismounting him. They gaze
      up at their vandalized pyramids and a HUSH falls over them.
61A   INT. NAPOLEON'S TENT -- DAY
      CLOSE ON Napoleon's pocketwatch. He snaps the watch closed.
      He is sitting in a camp chair, waiting.
      From a box, a PORTER brings Napoleon a glass of shaved ice.
      Napoleon waits for it to melt -- quickly in this heat.
                                                               29.


      He drinks his ice water.     He is in no hurry.   He rises from
      his chair --
61B   EXT. NAPOLEON'S TENT -- DAY
      -- and emerges from his tent to find the Mameluke chieftain
      and a half-dozen of his men waiting for him, standing in the
      heat. One has fainted - and is left where he fell.
      The Chieftain unsheathes his scabbard and walking to
      Napoleon, presents it in token of surrender. As one, the
      Mamelukes bow do wn before him.
      Napoleon waves them off.     He gazes at the Pyramids in the
      distance.
                            NAPOLEON (V.O.)
                In this land there is nothing but
                beauty, but in every beautiful thing
                I see only reflections of you.


62    INT. SALON - PARIS - NIGHT
      Josephine at card tables, gambling. Hippolyte is here,
      telling jokes and being very attractive socially.
      They flirt with eyes very openly.


63    INT. PARIS STORE - DAY
      Josephine's shopping habit. Josephine shops for bonnets and
      clothes. We see her purchasing a "Destiny" necklace.
      Hippolyte is here. Her friends Paul Barras and Theresa see
      them. Bad influence. They are ok with this affair.
                            NAPOLEON (VO)
                My dear Josephine, away from you
                there is no joy. You have robbed me
                of more than my soul; you are the
                one thought of my life.
                We won a great conquest toda y.     I
                am very tired.
                I know not if you want money, for
                you never speak to me of business.
                If you do, will you ask my brother
                for it - he has 200 Louis of mine.


64    INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE - JOSEPHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY
      Hippolyte Charles is in Josephine's mirrored bedroom.
      He is showing her how good he is at tying the perfect cravat.
                                                                 30.


                                 HIPPOLYTE (TYING THE CRAVAT)
               You see what most men do not
               understand... what they haven't the
               slightest comprehension of how to
               do.........is to make sure that the
               pleats......overlap the knot...it
               must......overwhelm the knot, don't you
               agree?
     He kisses her.   She is slow coming around, but kisses back.
     They have sex in the mirrored room.
                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               "You never write me, you don't care
               for your husband, you know the
               pleasure your letters give him, and
               you write him barely half a dozen
               lines. How, then, do you spend the
               livelong day, madam? What business
               of such importance robs you of the
               time to write your very kind lover?"
     IMAGE: Hippolyte leaving Josephine's bedroom, casually,
     quietly, no real attempt to hide it. He walks past LUCILLE,
     and out the door. She hides her eyes.

65   EXT. FOOT OF A PYRAMID - DAY
     A collection of scientists, archaeologists, linguists,
     painters, and clerics are here at Napoleon's command. Some
     are drinking champagne. It has the air of a cocktail party.
     Napoleon appears, freshly groomed and brushed.
     A PHARAOH's CASKET has been unearthed from beneath the
     pyramids and is standing upright under a shade--
     At his gesture, the Porters gently pry the lid off the
     coffin. The Pharaoh's mummy lies within. Napoleon makes a
     circular gesture with his finger -- "unwrap it." The Porters
     obey --
     -- and slowly, the 2500-year-old face is unveiled. A HUSH
     comes over the crowd. Napoleon steps in CLOSER --
     -- and touches the Pharaoh's face in his hands. It slowly
     crumbles away even as he stands before it. He gazes into the
     ancient face as you would a long-lost parent.
     His hand drops from the Pharaoh's face.
66   INT. PARIS SALON - NIGHT (AUGUST 1799)
     Josephine playing cards, looking far-off and lost.         Hippolyte
     nearby telling jokes with Barras and Theresa here.
                                                          31.


                           NAPOLEON (VO)
               "Josephine, what inclination in you
               stifles the affectionate love you
               promised me? I am uneasy getting no
               news from you. Write me four pages
               immediately and some of those
               charming remarks which fill my heart
               with the pleasure of your
               imagination. Be vigilant,
               Josephine, one fine night the doors
               will be broken in and I shall be
               before you....."


67   EXT. NAPOLEON'S TENT - EGYPT - EVENING
     Napoleon stands at a map-strewn table in his command tent
     sitting with Junot.
                           JUNOT
               are there limits to what I can tell
               you?
                           NAPOLEON
               there shouldn't be.
                           JUNOT
               Should I tell you something at the
               risk of giving you personal pain?
                           NAPOLEON
               yes.
                           JUNOT
               Your wife has taken a lover, named
               Hippolyte Charles.
     LONG PAUSE.
                           NAPOLEON
               Do you expect me to believe this?
                           JUNOT
               Yes.
                           NAPOLEON
               That my wife would treat me this
               way?
                           JUNOT
               yes.
                           NAPOLEON
               Junot, you are not only mistaken you
               are very wrong to have mentioned
               this.
               I will forget that you have said
               this to me.
                           (MORE)
                                                           32.

                             NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
                You are dismissed.
      HOLD NAPOLEON.

                vessels in the greatest secrecy......I
                am heading back home.
                            JUNOT
                This can be called desertion.
                            NAPOLEON
                General Kl�ber will be informed of
                his succession to command after I
                have left. Skillfully navigated,
                I will be back to France in six
                weeks.

     It's days later and pouring with rain. All of Josephine's
     belongings have been put out in the street. It's raining.
     She arrives back by carriage....
     She moves to the front door. It's locked.   She knocks over
     and over again...

76   INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE � LATER
     Josephine is in tears and soaked through, we are someplace
     mid-discussion..
     Eugene and Hortense are in the next room, over-hearing it
     through a closed door.
                           NAPOLEON
               You can't help yourself. It is
               impossible for most men to control
               their passions. You're a beast and
               I feel sorry for you.
                           JOSEPHINE
               Please don't leave me.

                           JOSEPHINE
               Promise me you won't leave me.
                           NAPOLEON
               A promise is nothing.
                           JOSEPHINE
               You don't have to forgive me, just
               promise me you won't leave.
                           NAPOLEON
               You're crying only proves my point.
               There is no use building this
               marriage on a false assumption
               that mankind is good.

               I am not built like other Men and I
               am not subject to petty
               insecurities.
                           JOSEPHINE
               Did you have affairs while you were
               away?
                            NAPOLEON
               Yes I did.
                           JOSEPHINE
               did you love them?
                           NAPOLEON
               no I did not.
                           JOSEPHINE
               were they pretty?

               purpose.
                           JOSEPHINE
               prettier than me?
                           NAPOLEON
               they cried less. which made them
               more attractive.
     Napoleon walks to the door to see Eugene & Hortense:
                            NAPOLEON
               As for you...you shall not bear the
               burden of your mother's faults. You
               shall always be my son: I will keep
               you with me.
                           EUGENE
               No, no, General. I must share ill
               fortune with my mother. And from
               this moment I say farewell to you.
     Napoleon opens his arms to Eugene and holds him.
     Hortense goes to his feet and embrace his knees.   And then,
     all is forgiven.

               News was very hard to come by in

                           GOHIER
               Yes, but you have been back for
               nearly three days, have you not had
               a moment to read of your popularity?

                           NAPOLEON
               I have returned to France to find
               her bankrupt, printing money that is
               spent within hours, the Austro-
               Russian overrun of Italy, the Anglo-
               Russian occupation of Holland and
               what seems to be the imminent
               Invasion of France herself at any
               moment...added to which the
               discovery that my wife is a slut.
     CU. SIEYES looking at Napoleon...
78   INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
     Josephe SIEY�S and Napoleon over breakfast. This meeting has
     been arranged by Talleyrand and Napoleon's brother Lucien who
     sit quietly.
                           SIEY�S
               The only thing every French Citizen
               can agree on is that you are our
               Ceasar.
                           NAPOLEON
               What do you want?
                            SIEY�S
               The people will accept my rule if I
               have your support...It is only a
               military dictatorship that will save
               this country from a restoration of
               the Mona rchy...seizure is possible
               with your help at the right
               time....and this is the time.
                           NAPOLEON
               ...the support that you need is the
               Minister of Police, without Citizen
               Fouche you have very little chance
               of success....so you expect me to be
               your "sword"?
                           SIEY�S
               I expect that a coup d'etat, well-
               timed and executed can place power
               to Three Consuls - Myself, Ducos and
               you....I'm Inviting You To The
               Winning Side.
79   INT. SALON - DAY
     A casual meeting of NAPOLEON, LUCIEN, SIEYES, ROGER-DUCOS and
     TALLEYRAND....
     JOSEPH FOUCHE, Minister Of Police, enters, greets everyone.
     They sit down.
                                                           37.


                           SIEY�S
               My proposal is to persuade the 5
               Directors to resign under threat of
               an imminent sieze of power. We
               create this threat. Myself and
               Ducos resign first, followed by
               Barras, Gohier, and Moulin.....this
               will create an opening to transfer
               power......
                           NAPOLEON
               I like Barras but he is corrupt and
               isolated. I should think that under
               the proper threat, he will quickly
               make the right decision...I c annot
               say the same about Gohier and
               Moulin.
                           FOUCHE
               There are ways to dissuade them from
               resistance.
                           SIEY�S
               Yes, but this may not become a
               military or violent matter....
                           FOUCHE
               It will be a police matter. And
               don't expect that you won't get your
               hair ruffled, Citizen Sieyes.....
                            SIEY�S
               Yes.....so......Lucien....as
               Governor of the Council of
               500....you will persuade both
               Councils...in an emergency
               se ssion.....that there is a Jacobin
               coup at hand.....and that the only
               safe place is out of the city, away
               from the Paris mob, at St.
               Cloud.......where a vote of
               emergency power to from the Council
               of the Elders to a new Council of
               Three will save them from threat....
80   INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE -- NIGHT
     NAPOLEON and his brother LUCIEN and JOSEPHINE. Napoleon has
     outlined his own plan of attack at St. Cloud....
     She raises very practical questions about the plan:
                           JOSEPHINE
               The flaw in Siey�s plan is the
               interval between the two votes.
               The opposition will have time to
               grow wise to what you're doing....
                                                          38.


                           NAPOLEON
               You are right. You are right my
               little General.
               The interval can't be helped. But
               the shorter the interval between two
               votes the greater the chance for
               success.......
                           JOSEPHINE
               What is the outcome of this if you
               don't succeed?
                           NAPOLEON
               That's not a consideration.
                           JOSEPHINE
               It should be. (Why not?)
                           NAPOLEON
               To consider it is to imagine that it
               may happen - I don't see the point
               in imagining a nything but success.

81   INT. CHATEAU DE BONAPARTE - NIGHT
     Napoleon puts TWO PISTOLS by his bedside table and gets into
     bed with Josephine...she sees them....
                           NAPOLEON
               From this moment on...all friends
               that you have had...Barras, Tallien,
               any one from the society of the
               Directory may not be trusted.
               ......by this time tomorrow you will
               be sleeping with the First Consul of
               France.   And I will stick it to
               you......
     She nods, `yes' and he gobbles her up.

82   INT. BARRAS APARTMENT - MORNING
     TALLEYRAND comes to BARRAS door with TWO GUARDS.    Barras
     looks like he had a late night with some boys and girls and
     he's hungover
                           TALLEYRAND
               Good morning, Paul....I'm Going To
               Make This Easy For You.   I have
               documents announcing your
               resignation from the Council.....
                           BARRAS
               I return with joy to the ranks of
               simple citizen.
                                                           39.


                           TALLEYRAND
               You will retire before you have your
               breakfast....
     Two More Guards Step in the door.   TIME CUT TO: Barras is
     signing away his Council seat.


83   INT. GOHIER'S RESIDENCE - MORNING
     Gohier is still in his pajamas and he's screaming at General
     Moreau.
                            GOHIER
               I'M NOT SIGNING ANYTHING. YOU CAN
               PISS BEFORE I SIGN AWAY ANYTHING.
               WHO'S DONE THIS? WHAT OUTLAW HAS
               DONE THIS???
     THE GUARDS COME TOWARDS HIM AND HE STARTS THROWING BOOKS AND
     PAPERS, ANYTHING TO AVOID ARREST.


84   INT. MOULIN'S RESIDENCE - MORNING
     Moulin is dragged from his house protesting.   His wife is
     screaming and crying hysterically.
                           MOULIN
               NO! NO! NO! HOW DARE YOU! I AM
               EATING MY BREAKFAST. I AM ENJOYING A
               SUCCULENT BREAKFAST. THIS IS
               OUTRAGEOUS. I WILL FINISH MY
               BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU TOUCH ME. A
               SUCCULENT BREAKKFASSSSSTTTTTTTTTT.


85   EXT. CHATEAU DE SAINT-CLOUD - DAY
     700 Troops are here stationed around the grounds.
     A procession of COUNCIL OF ANCIENTS and the COUNCIL OF THE
     500...arriving...... They wear bizarre Togas with purple
     belts.   It's an odd and comical sight. Napoleon watching
     them as they arrive and enter.
     Napoleon is flanked by Roger Ducos, Talleyrand and Sieyes,
     who see Bonaparte's army beginning to assemble around the
     existing Troops. Napoleon nod s toward Junot, who stands with
     the army.
     Sieyes begins to panic, uncertain of Napoleon's plan...
                           SIEY�S
               (What is the meaning of this?)
                                                          40.


     Napoleon ignores him.
                             SIEY�S (CONT'D)
               Bonaparte?
                           NAPOLEON
               Stop your sniveling, you should be
               thrown in a lake, you expect to be
               First Consul...you're not fit to
               wash a dish........
     Napoleon storms toward the entrance.
                           SIEY�S
               Where are you going? What are you
               doing?




86   INT. CHATEAU DE SAINT-CLOUD - VOTING HALL - DAY
     The Council has assembled in their weird Robes and Togas and
     purple outfits...
     Milling about, there is the general sense of confusion and
     unease.....Lucien brings the meeting to order.....
     A pompous looking Jacobian: CITIZEN GILBERT is surrounded by
     his fellow Jacobians' and they are speaking about how
     suspicious this all is.....
                            CITIZEN GILBERT (TO LUCIEN)
               Director....Director......I believe
               the tim e has come to demand an
               explanation......
                           LUCIEN
               This Emergency Session is to draw a
               list of Nominations for a New
               Directory to deal with the threat of
               the Royalists --

     Murmurs and crowd growing restless. Citizen Gilbert drips
     with sarcasm:
                           CITIZEN GILBERT
               We are being asked to pass a
               resolution forming a provisional
               government to three counsuls -
               General Bonaparte and Citizens
               Sieyes and Roger-D ucos -- where are
               the Five members of the Directory?
               Have they magically disappeared? And
               we are here, surrounded by troops -
               isolated far from Paris --
     Crowd is rumbling.
                                                      41.


                      LUCIEN
          Order. Order.
                      CITIZEN GILBERT
          This is becoming increasingly
          clear.......That Your Brother,
          Napoleon Bonaparte.....with his show
          of Military Might is acting as an
          Outlaw......and that this is a
          ridiculous and poorly executed take
          over --
                      LUCIEN
          .... A vote will settle this matter.
                      CITIZEN GILBERT
          .... He is a Power Hungry
          Upstart....who By some miracle of
          timing has now
          eliminated......Barras ,
          Moulin....Gohier....
Napoleon finally steps forward through the growing melee:
                      NAPOLEON
          IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF WHAT IS
          HAPPENING HERE I WILL ANSWER:
          YOU, YOURSELVES HAVE VIOLATED THE
          CONSTITUTION AND TARNISHED THIS
          REPUBLIC BEYOND RECOGNITION. YOU ARE
          SITTING ON A VOLCANO.
                      CITIZEN GILBERT
          So says the Outlaw......
Pointing toward Napoleon.
                       COUNCIL MEMBERS
          OUTLAW! OUTLAW! DEATH TO THE
          TYRANT. DOW N WITH THE DICTATOR.
                      NAPOLEON
          "I walk with the god of victory and
          the god of war!"
              (then)
          ("Let those who love me follow me!")
They ATTACK HIM. Some draw daggers and pistols.   He is
surrounded by a hostile crowd.
NAPOLEON'S GUARDS have to push and shove their way to him --
they try to surround him -- BUT THE CROWD CLAWS AND SCRATCHES
HIS FACE. He's BLOODY.
                       LUCIEN
          "The president of the Council of
          F ive Hundred declares to you that
          the great majority of the council
          is, at this moment, terrorized by
          certain deputies armed with daggers.

                            LUCIEN (CONT'D)
                            LUCIEN (CONT'D)
                These madmen have outlawed
                themselves by their attempts upon
                the liberty of the Council."
      Lucien pulls his sword and holds it to his brother's throat:
                            LUCIEN (CONT'D)
                I will Kill My Brother if he
                violates the freedom of the French
                people.
      The Guards of the Council are overcome as A COLUMN OF
      GRENADIERS enters into the hall of the Five Hundred.
      Deputies panic, jump out of windows and get away into th e
      gardens. BEDLAM.

92    INT. TUILERIES - NAPOLEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
      Napoleon and Josephine get in bed together.
      TITLE: FIRST CONSUL, 1800
      The first night that they spent there he said to her:
                            NAPOLEON
                Come, little Creole, get into the
                bed of your masters....
93    INT. TUILERIES - NAPOLEON'S BEDROOM - DAY
      Another day and Napoleon is going over wardrobe for the First
      Consul and his staff...VARIOUS STUFF:
                            NAPOLEON
                Each should wear a red coat, made in
                Winter in velvet, in Summer some
                other material...embroidered in
                gold.
      He is standing with two officials CAMBACERES and LE BRUN,
      elderly, powdered, lace ruffles, and sword, etc...
                                                            43.


                           NAPOLEON
               It is not every one who has the
               right to be plainly dressed.
94   INT. TUILERIES - NIGHT
     Cocktail Party with Josephine's children and Napoleon and his
     family. Very jovial, celebratory.
     We are introduced here to Napoleon's mother: LETIZIA. She is
     introduced to Josephine for the first time and is very cold
     to Josephine. They share the most basic greetings.
     Josephine bows to her. Napoleon moves Letizia around the
     room to meet more people, leaving Josephine alone......
95   INT. TUILERIES - NAPOLEON'S OFFICE - DAY
     Napoleon in his office having a golden directoir desk,
     signing documents and dictating letters, etc....

               "I still sometimes tremble at the
               strange and dizzy ascent to
               supremacy....this Wild Pastime of

               careful..."
96   INT. TUILERIES - SALON ROOM - DAY
     Josephine remained at home in the morning, receiving an
     immense number of visitors, chiefly women. Most are
     Nobles/Aristocrats who've come for "erasures" or
     restitutions. She receives them with perfect grace.
     She promised everything. (NOTE: Will provide dialogue for
     these scenes)


97   INT. TUILERIES - DINNER TABLE - NIGHT
     Dignitaries   seated at a long dinner table. Josephine at the
     head of the   table. Napoleon walks around the table, never
     really sits   down or stays in one place too long. He's quite
     flirty with   the women, especially in front of their husbands.
     See TALLEYRAND at work around the edges, constantly
     hovering....
98   INT. TUILERIES - BATHROOM - MORNING
     Napoleon is shaving and dictating a letter to his secretary,

               "......France and England are
               wasting their prosperity. I am not
               ashamed to take the initiative. I
               have, I think, sufficiently proved
               to the whole world that I do not
               fear the chances of war.   Peace is
               my heartfelt wish between England
               and France.........."
99   INT. TUILERIES - DAY
     ARMAND-AUGSTIN-LOUIS de CAULAINCOURT is quite the noble
     gentleman. He is fluent in many languages and was Napoleon's
     AIDE-DE-CAMP.
     He enters, there are all kinds of greetings and pleasantries.
                           CAULINCOURT
               I have notified all foreign powers
               of your accession to the Consul. I
               have adressed letters to all
               Diplomatic agents abroad and I
               understand you have made friendly
               overtures of peace to England.
                           N APOLEON
               What I would like from you is a
               better understanding of the Russian
               Tsar Alexander. Would you consider
               the Tsar an ally to France or
               England?
                            NAPOLEON
               Citizen Caulincourt, as you know I
               have notified all foreign powers of
               my accession to the Consul. I have
               addressed letters to all Diplomatic
               agents abroad.    I have made
               friendly overtures of peace to
               England and I would like your help
               in obt aining a better picture of the
               Russian Tsar Alexander.....would You
               consider the Tsar an ally of England
               or France?
                           CAULINCOURT
               I would think that his trade with
               England is more beneficial to him
               than his trade with France.
                           NAPOLEON
               Do you have a sense of British
               influence in the Russian Courts?
                                                           45.


                             CAULINCOURT
                 I do not, but I imagine it's quite
                 robust.
                             NAPOLEON
                 What kind of a man is Alexander?
                             CAULINCOURT
                 He is young, he is vain, he is
                 popular and his wishes to remain so.
                 His greatest fear is to be killed in
                 his bed, unlike his Father. This
                 makes him dangerously fickle to
                 whoever last has his attention.
                              NAPOLEON
                 It sounds to me like he needs an
                 ally that he can can also call a
                 friend......

                 Ah! What a surprise! How good to see
                 you out --
                             AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR
                 Good evening....I'm just trying to
                 loose some money....
                             TALLEYRAND
                 Come join me after this hand?
                             AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR
                 That's a lovely idea.

                             TALLEYRAND
                 Did you hear that your Majesty
                 received a letter of peace from the
                 first council today?
                             AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR
                 I was just informed of that.....

      Talleyrand is getting the Ambassador a little drunk....
                                                              46.

                First Consul Bonaparte would like to
                make it clear to the Austrian
                Emperor that he will negotiate for
                Peace only on the basis of the Campo
                Formio Treaty.....
                            AUSTRIAN
                Msr. Talleyrand, while my ears hear
                you with great appreciation � if I
                may be honest, Austria's coalition
                with England is in such a strong
                position against France that these
                peace overtures are clearly only for
                your handling of French Public
                Opinion.
                              TALLEYRAND
                You know me so well...yes, it's
                true...it is public opinion Napoleon
                is after...and my warning to you is
                that he is as hungry for it as any
                man in the history of the world: So
                my suggestion, with respect, is take
                this offering of Peace from him or
                suffer the consequences of a Man
                Bent On Peace At Any Cost. He has
                sent a peace offering to King George
                and heard nothing in reply.
                I suggest that you do not make the
                same mistake......

                The English Ambassador, Lord
                Whitworth has arrived.

106   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - TUILERIES � DAY
      A reception of great pomp. Dignitaries mingle,   socializing
      at an official function.

      Napoleon makes his way through the room and finds his way to:
      AMBASSADOR LORD WHITWORTH (pompous, English, George Sanders
      type).
                            NAPOLEON
                DO NOT LOOK AT MY FACE AS IF YOU
                DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY.
                               LORD WHITWORTH
                ....
      The party stops. Josephine enters. Silence and then:
                            NAPOLEON
                ARE YOU AWARE OF MY LETTER OF P EACE
                TO YOUR KING?
                               LORD WHITWORTH
                I am not.
                            NAPOLEON
                SHALL I REPEAT IT?
                               LORD WHITWORTH
                If You Wish.
                            NAPOLEON
                I will not waste my breadth.
                Take this as a warning to your King:
                I will keep you guessing and scared.
                You will watch your borders and your
                back and your manners are bound,
                sooner or later, to be French. I
                will offer no more letters of peace
                and I will take the lack of a swift
                reply as an act of dis-respect. As
                for you, Lord Whitworth, I would
                offer you a glass of champagne but I
                am out of piss and vinegar.
      Napoleon storms out of the room.
                            LORD WHITWORTH
                It is a shame such a great man
                should have no manners.



107   INT. TUILERIES - MAP ROOM -- DAY (SPRING 1800)
      OVERHEAD SHOT: A VAST MAP OF Europe is being painted by
      Jacques-Louis David himself, consisting of stitched-together
      canvases. The paint is still wet.
                                                              48.


      There are CHESS TYPE PIECES THAT SHOW THE CAMPAIGNS MOVEMENTS
      (details in research)
      Napoleon comes down off a high ladder gazing down upon it....
                            DAVID
                Take care, the paint is wet.
      His Marshals -- Davout, Berthier, Ney, Dumas -- are in
      attendance.
      His Generals - Jacques Chambarlhac, Kellerman, Lannes are
      here.
      Talleyrand watches Napoleon approach the map, getting on his
      hands and knees. He moves h is fingers across the wet paint,
      smearing it.
      He approaches a vast mountain range -- the ALPS.
                            NAPOLEON
                St. Pierre. St. Bernard and then
                over the great crest of the Alps
                with reduced artillery. Let us
                forward then and restore what France
                lost while I was away....
      The impossibility of this approach registers with his
      Marshals and Generals.
                            DAVOUT
                ...the Austrians have consolidated
                their forces there, First
                Consul...to secure control of the
                peninsula's northern half...
      They all watch Napoleon, lost in the map.
                            BERTHIER
                ...South of Alessandria. In Marengo.
      Napoleon's fingers circle the wet paint on `Marengo.'
                            DAVOUT
                Their military are very well-
                provisioned for battle...
                            NAPOLEON
                This is not a military battle.
                This is a political battle.

                 This conspiracy of Royals against me
                 is clear � all exiled Bourbon's
                 whose single aim is to overthrow my
                 rule and re-instate their filthy
                 perfume-Monarchy.
                 The Prince de Conde is smuggling out
                 plotters and his grandson, Louis,
                 the Duke d'Enghein is on the
                 frontier solely for that purpose. I
                 want this man seized and I want him
                 brought swiftly to justice.

                 First Consul, I know this man. He
                 is not a conspirator against you.
                 He is a brave and excellent officer
                 much loved by the soldiery.
                             NAPOLEON
                 He is a Bourbon weasel who will
                 punished for his part in this plot
                 against me.
                             CAULINCOURT
                 If you proceed to Baden, you will be
                 operating outside of France a nd so
                 far outside of the law that it will
                 be impossible for anyone to ignore.

                             NAPOLEON
                 I have always profited from your
                 judgement and now it's time to
                 profit from watching you close your
                 mouth.

                 Seize the Duke.
       Fouche leaves the room to make this happen.
                             JOSEPHINE
                 you're letting your hatred make
                 your decision --
                             NAPOLEON
                 I'm not capable of acting from
                 revenge. I am sweeping an obstacle
                 from my path. You would complain if
                 I struck a weaker   blow and you
                 would look at me wit h even more
                 contempt than you are now � I
                 suggest you change your look.
                             JOSEPHINE
                 No I would not complain about a
                 weaker blow and no I will not
                 contort my face for your pleasure.
                             NAPOLEON
                 In a years time � you will regard
                 this execution as a great act of
                 policy and you will kiss my mouth

112    EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
       Talleyrand and Napoleon are walking around a private
       courtyard, their guards are present. Silence, then:
                                                       52.


                            TALLEYRAND
                Are you pleased?
                            NAPOLEON
                Yes, why?
                            TALLEYRAND
                Because when you are not pleased you
                are not always pleasant.
                            NAPOLEON
                Are you about to tell me something
                that will make me angry?
                            TALLEYRAND
                I am going to suggest something that
                has been a long time arriving. I
                suggest that you abandon your role
                as First Consul of France in
                exchange for the title of
                "Victorious Consul." By another
                name, King.
      After a long, long time thinking, he says:
                            NAPOLEON
                That is your word, "King." That
                title is worn thin. It would make
                me an heir and I will be an heir to
                no one. The title that I bear is a
                grander one, somewhat vague and
                leaves something to the
                imagination....

113   INT. TUILERIES - SMALL DINING ROOM - MORNING
      Breakfast. Josephine and Napoleon speaking.
      CU. NAPOLEON
                            NAPOLEON
                Why aren't you pregnant?
                            JOSEPHINE
                Is that a question or an accusation
                of me?
                            NAPOLEON
                It is a very clear question.
                            JOSEPHINE
                I have seen Dr. Covisar and he has
                no answer for me. Only the
                suggestion that I do what Mdme de
                Chocolate Souffle has done....
                            NAPOLEON
                Which is?
                                                       53.


                            JOSEPHINE
                Along with hopeful thinking and red
                wine, he suggested I take the waters
                at Aix-la-Chappelle.
                            NAPOLEON
                Then why haven't you?
                            JOSEPHINE
                As wife of the First Consul,
                I haven't found the time. I spend
                many hours cleaning up after you.
                            NAPOLEON
                find the time.   I don't need to
                explain to you the importance of
                this, or do I?
                            JOSEPHINE
                I know that you will anyway.
                            NAPOLEON
                ....
                            JOSEPHINE
                you will want a son/heir.
                            NAPOLEON
                It's quite simple, yes.
                            JOSEPHINE
                We have a son...
                            NAPOLEON
                It's not enough to crown Eugene.
                He is my son in every respect with
                one exception that cannot be
                overlooked.
                            JOSEPHINE
                You have alarmed me by your
                ambition; return to moderation. If
                you crown yourself - Kings will
                despise you as an upstart, the
                people will hate you as a usurper,
                your equals as a tyrant --

118   INT. NOTRE-DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY (DECEMBER 2, 1804)
      An audience of five thousand fills the pews. A CHOIR of FOUR
      HUNDRED SINGERS is singing "Handel's Messiah."
      The pews are packed with Napoleon's military officers -- many
      of whom are passing wineskins and jugs of beer. They are
      already drunk; in a minute they'll start a soccer chant.
      The scene is being drawn by Jacques-Louis David -- the same
      painter who Josephine had pointed out to Napoleon at the Bal
      des Victimes.
      Napoleon wears an eighty-pound coronation mantle of red
      velvet lined in ermine; beside him Josephine wears a similar
      mantle covered with embroidered golden bees. Napoleon's
      sisters resentfully carry her train.
      Napoleon's brother is here, all our principal cast so far.
      Hortense, Eugene, Mother Letizia Napoleon, etc.
      Napoleon and Josephine kneel before the Pope.
                             POPE PIUS VII
                M ay God affirm you on his throne and
                Christ give you to rule with him in
                his eternal kingdom.
      THE HERALD OF ARMS appears holding a red velvet pillow with a
      crown placed upon it. The Pope moves to crown Napoleon who
      takes it from his hand, as rehearsed and says:
                            NAPOLEON
                I found the crown of France in the
                gutter and I placed it atop my head.
      A second pillow is brought forth: this one has a smaller
      crown upon it. He places the crown gently upon her head.
                             POPE PIUS VII
                The most glorious, the most august
                Napoleon, Emperor of the French, is
                crowned and enthroned. Long Live
                The Emperor.
                            CROWD
                Vive l'Empereur!
                            TALLEYRAND/BARRAS
                Emperor!
      Emperor and Empress Napoleon and Josephine proceed down the
      aisle.
      A handsome hussar we recognize stands during the procession:
      HIPPOLYTE CHARLES. His eyes meet Josephine's. Napoleon
      catches this.
                                                            55.


119   INT.   MILITARY BARRACKS -- DAY
      Hippolyte Charles stands at attention in an empty barracks
      entrance.
      Through the doors outside, a small group of RIFLE CORPS
      INFANTRY -- enough to make up a firing squad, perhaps -- go
      through maneuvers. Rifles are fired. Hippolyte flinches as
      a junior officer summons him to follow.
      Hippolyte enters.   Junot is here, Napoleon motions for
      Hippolyte.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Captain Charles, come in.
      Hippolyte c omes in and salutes.
                             NAPOLEON
                 You know my SUCH AND SUCH Junot.
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 Yes, your Majesty.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Captain Charles, in which division
                 do you serve?
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 The Nineteenth, Majesty.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Leclerc's division.
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 Yes, Majesty.
                             NAPOLEON
                 In Haiti.
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 Yes, Majesty.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Yellow fever is a dishonorable and
                 painful way to die.
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 Yes, Majesty.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Do you believe the Haitians p laced a
                 curse on him?
                             HIPPOLYTE
                 I don't know.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Do you believe in vodou?
                                                 56.


                      HIPPOLYTE
          No, Your Majesty, I do not.
                      NAPOLEON
          Neither do I.
Long pause, then:
                      NAPOLEON
          I must confess something to you in
          the greatest secrecy, Captain
          Charles...may I do that?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Yes, your Majesty.
                      NAPOLEON
          It is indiscreet and I hope you will
          not blush....
                      HIPPOLYTE
          ...
                      NAPOLEON
          Do you have children?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Yes, Majesty. I have three sons.
                       NAPOLEON
          My wife is unable to conceive a
          child fo r me. I have tried for many
          years and it is becoming clear to me
          that I am unequipped to finish what
          I have started. If you please, may
          I ask you something personal?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Of course, Majesty.
                      NAPOLEON
          When you have sex (make love) with
          your wife, is she beneath you?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Yes.
                      NAPOLEON
          Always?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Not always, Majesty.
                      NAPOLEON
          Sometimes she is on top of you?
                      HIPPOLYTE
          Yes, Majesty.
                                       57.


            NAPOLEON
And sometimes you are behind her?
            HIPPOLYTE
Yes, Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
And sometimes you are gentle with
her?
            HIPPOLYTE
Yes, Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
And sometimes you are rough with
her?
               HIPPOLYTE
Yes Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
Tell me: which does she prefer?
            HIPPOLYTE
She prefers for me to be happy, your
Majesty.
             NAPOLEON
So whatever mood you are in, she
will obey...
            HIPPOLYTE
Yes, Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
This is a good woman. Tell me, when
you made your wife pregnant did you
spend much time?
            HIPPOLYTE
I don't remember, Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
If you were to guess.
            HIPPOLYTE
We sometimes take 30 minutes....
            NAPOLEON
....and other times?
            HIPPOLYTE
Sometimes we take only a few
moments.
            NAPOLEON
A few minutes?
            HIPPOLYTE
Yes.   Majesty.
                                       58.


            NAPOLEON
Which does she prefer?
            HIPPOLYTE
She has told me that she enjoys our
love making to take some time.
            NAPOLEON
This is important, for I have
thought that sex is merely a
transaction between two people that
need only last a few moments.
Perhaps my wife is unsatisfied and
therefore incapable of giving me a
child.   Do you think this is
possible?
               HIPPOLYTE
Perhaps.....
            NAPOLEON
Are you excellent at satisfying her?
            HIPPOLYTE
........my wife is satisfied,
Majesty.
            NAPOLEON
And do you think this is what your
secret is to having a son?
            HIPPOLYTE
I cannot say for certain, Majesty. I
love my wife.
            NAPOLEON
So do I. And I want to see her
happy, so tell me -- is it important
for a man to pleasure his wife in
anticipation of entering her?
            HIPPOLYTE
...I don't know what you mean, your
Majesty.
             NAPOLEON
Don' t be shy, Captain. Tell me...if
I wanted a son, do you think I
should spend time with my mouth down
between my wife's legs?
            HIPPOLYTE
I would assume, your highness...that
the more pleasure your wife gets,
the more likely she is to conceive,
but I am not a doctor. I have no
evidence to support this.
                                                           59.


                            NAPOLEON
                No, of course not, I know. I should
                like to thank you for your honesty
                in talking about such uncomfortable
                matters, but I sought your advice as
                a man of notable cocksmanship and
                stature. You have a pretty face and
                a hair-dresser's elegance.
                            HIPPOLYTE
                Thank you, Majesty.
                            NAPOLEON
                You're dismissed.

                In the English fleet, 450 were

                French fleet, 3000 were killed and
                2000 wounded.
                            NAPOLEON
                I don't consider this verdict final.

122   INT. TUILERIES - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
      At the dinner table, Napoleon says to Josephine: MOM is
      here, sisters too and Lucien. Family dinner. Everyone is
      very quiet as Napoleon is in a temper that is boiling at the
      dinner table. Finally, he aims at Josephine:
                            NAPOLEON
                I must warn you....but Without a
                Time Limit (for that is my
                prerogative)...that if you don't
                bear me a child There Will Be A
                Divorce.
                            JOSEPHINE
                There isn't sufficient love-making
                in this home to bear a child.
                            NAPOLEON
                Yes there is. There have been years
                of it - and with more than just me -
                and still -- you are empty.
                            JOSEPHINE
                And you are fat.
                                                           60.


                              NAPOLEON
                  I enjoy my meals.
                  Destiny has brought me here.....
                  Destiny has brought me this lamb
                  chop.
      She becomes emotional.
                              NAPOLEON
                  Ahhh yes. tears. That will do it.
                  That will make me an heir. TEARS.
                  Two things that look good on a
                  woman: tears and rouge.

                               NAPOLEON
                  I'm sorry.    I didn't believe what I
                  said to you.
      She nods.
                              NAPOLEON
                  I love your talents and taste. And
                  when I am not with you I think of
                  your grace and dignity. You will be
                  in command of our Kingdom while I am
                  away.......and I will come back to
                  you.
      He kisses her.
124   INT. TUILERIES - NAPOLEON'S OFFICE - DAY
      Josephine speaks with Talleyrand.
                              JOSEPHINE
                  As you know, the Emperor has asked
                  me in his absence to give audience
                  to the Senate and the different
                  authorities. Without too fine a
                  point, I am here to translate the
                  meaning of his wishes.......that
                  While He Is Away At Battle, we will
                  keep the planning of his demise to a
                  minimum....and that begins with you,
                  Msr. Talleyrand.
                              TALLEYRAND
                  Yes, Empress.
                                                              61.


125   EXT. SNOWFIELD, AUSTERLITZ - DAY (DECEMBER 2, 1805)
      A vast snowfield. A lonely peasant crosses on foot leading
      an old donkey, carrying a bundle of firewood on his back.
      The peasant's moth-eaten coat is two sizes too large.
      Look closer: the rider is Napoleon. He takes out a spyglass
      and looks out across the snowfield at a war camp
      approximately 3/4 miles away.
      In the near distance, a company of three RUSSIAN SCOUTS is on
      patrol. One is urinating in the snow, while the other is
      cleaning his rifle. He sights the rifle --
      And sees: Napoleon in his peasant garb at distance. The
      Russian gestures. Napoleon smiles, waves in greeting.   The
      Russian si ghts Napoleon again, thinks to himself,
      hesitates....
      The other Russians are leaving.     He closes the hammer of his
      rifle and walks off.
      Napoleon pulls out his scope and looks....
      HIS POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: a flurry of activity, then the
      arrival of a royal procession. The troops, who were shaving,
      singing songs, boot-blacking, look up........
126   EXT. RUSSIAN/AUSTRIAN CAMP - SAME
      Hundreds of Russian Troops stand at attention as a team of
      plumed horses approaches --
      -- and they catch a glimpse of the cherished Tsar Alexander
      as his flotilla canters elegantly to the Imperial Tent.....
      ANGLE, UNDERCOVER PEASANT NAPOLEON watching the two Emperor's
      meet and greet and hug each other in all Royal-ness on the
      battlefield.
      HIS POV - THROUGH THE SCOPE
      Alexander and Francis look lik e best friends....
      Undercover Peasant Napoleon turns away and rides off.
127   INT. RUSSIAN/AUSTRIAN CAMP - DAY
      Tsar Alexander and Francis are sitting together.
                            FRANCIS II
                I can't fool you, Alexander. Until
                your arrival here, this Battle
                against him has been brutal and
                terrifying. The loss of Vienna is
                more than I can bear. To have you
                here means we can begin refreshed.
                                                               62.


                              ALEXANDER
                 I am....always Here for you,
                 Francis.     And I am over-whelmed
                 with the excitement of the
                 Battlefield!    It is thrilling to
                 smell the danger!
                 When do we begin?!
128   EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
      Napoleon arrives and is greeted by his officers. A small
      village is being evacuated: troops are leading the villagers
      away from their homes.
      As he makes his way through the village, Bonaparte removes
      his moth-eaten coat and puts on his splendid overcoat.
      MONTAGE: The cannons are wheeled in. The troops are digging
      shallow trenches. Others are making slots in the stone
      walls, breaking awa y masonry to create firing positions,
      turning the village into a fortress.
      Night is falling: Napoleon sees it's time.      Snow is falling.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Tell the men to light those
                 campfires and keep them burning.
                 I'll be in my tent.
      On Napoleon's orders, CAMPFIRES are lit along the snowfield.
129   INT. NAPOLEON'S TENT - NIGHT
      Napoleon sleeps on a camp bed by lamplight in the small tent.


130   EXT. SNOWFIELD - NIGHT
      At one mile, two COSSACK SCOUTS stop in the dark to light a
      cheroot.    They smell the smoke from the camp. They ride
      toward it -- and discover the encampment of Bonaparte's
      French Troops.
      At a distance they see an encampment (ten thousand men) of
      Napoleon's troops warming themselves by their fires by the
      village. They turn their horses around and canter away.
131   EXT. FRENCH WAR CAMP, AUSTERLITZ - NIGHT
      A signalman sees the Cossacks and semaphores a message.
      The other signalman rushes to Napoleon's tent.

132   INT.   TENT - NIGHT
      The signalman runs in to wake Napoleon.
                                                           63.


                             SIGNALMAN
                 We are discovered, your majesty.
                 They'll be here in the morning.
                             NAPOLEON
                 Wake me then.

133   EXT. MONTAGE - EARLY DAWN
      French signalman and scouts watch and wait in the bitter
      cold.
134   EXT. FRENCH WAR CAMP, AUSTERLITZ - MORNING
      A SIGNALMAN looking down sees the combined RUSSIAN AND
      AUSTRIAN ARMIES -- almost 60,000 troops -- coming round the
      edge of the snowfield.
      The Signalman sends a message by semaphore to the camp below
      to warn everyone that the Russo-Austrian troops are
      advancing.
      MONTAGE:
      Trenched Rifle FUSILIERS emerge from under their snow-covered
      tarps while remaining hidden from view. The tarps are pulled
      back from cannons, revealing their muzzles.
      MONTAGE FROM HERE - SAME TIME
      THE RUSSO-AUSTRIAN TROOPS, organized in military formation,
      appear through a shroud of morning fog.
      FRENCH CAVALRY are preparing themselves in a misty forest.
      A DISTANCE FROM THE FRENCH BASE - SAME
      The Russo-Austrian troops muster, with lines of fusiliers as
      a front line. The French Camp is still shrouded in mist and
      smoking fires.
      MONTAGE: French RIFLEMEN behind the stone walls ready to
      fire.
      Austrians and Russians sound the bugle to advance.
      ANGLE, TSAR ALEXANDER and AUSTRIAN EMPEROR FRANCIS watching
      their troops head into battle.
      The fusiliers moves as a regiment in lines of 200 men as the
      French open fire - surprisingly ready -
      NOW NAPOLEON"S POV - PRECISION FROM ABOVE.
                              NAPOLEON
                 Fusiliers!
      This is relayed by troops as....
                                                            64.


      THE FRENCH FUSILIERS emerge from their position beneath the
      tarps and discard in double-time, racing down the hill to
      engage the Russo-Austrians below, attacking them from the
      left flank.
                            FRANCIS II
                Cavalry.
      THE RUSSIAN/AUSTRIAN CAVALRY gallop into the attack through
      the chaos from their concealed position in the trees.
                            NAPOLEON
                Cavalry.
      Now the French Cavalry appear from their respective
      positions , converge on the enemy from the left rear guard...
      This movement forces the Russo-Austrian troops to fall back
      and retreat in the direction left for them: THE WHITE EXPANSE
      BEYOND.
      THE RUSSO-AUSTRIANS scramble and fall back onto the expanse,
      turning and firing on their pursuers as they go. But on a
      few faces we see the dawning realization that the French
      aren't following them. They turn and retu rn fire.
      NAPOLEON stands on his hilltop position, watching the scene.
      His arm is raised in the air to signal his cannons -- then he
      drops it, giving the signal to fire:
                            NAPOLEON
                Cannons.
135   EXT. FRENCH CANNON BATTERY -- SAME
      The hidden French battery launches a FUSILLADE of CANNONBALLS
      toward the white surface which reveals itself as a frozen
      lake.
      ANGLE, FRANCIS AND ALEXANDER watching this happen.
136   EXT. SATSCHAN LAKE -- DAY
      The glowing cannonballs streak through the sky towards us.
      The ice is shattered -- great cracks race across its surface,
      spiderwebbing beneath the feet of the retreating soldiers --
      a chasm opens up as the ice disintegrates. Sheets of ice
      break away as men and horses slide into the water.
      -- and the combined armies of Russia and Austria are plunged
      en masse into the freezing depths.
137   EXT. RUSSIAN POSITION -- DAY
      Francis II looks on from a vantage point.
                                                              65.


138   EXT. SATSCHAN LAKE -- DAY
      Russian troops, horses, cannons -- most of the army -- slides
      away into the depths of the lake.
139   EXT. HILLTOP -- AUSTERLITZ -- DAY
      Napoleon watches the scene from high above.
140   EXT. SATSCHAN LAKE -- EVE
      After a few moments, the scene goes quiet: the allied armies
      have been swallowed up by the freezing lake. A small mascot
      dog is left barking at the edge of the black water. Other
      troops have surrendered and are kneeling in the snow on solid
      ice.
141   EXT. HILLTOP -- AUSTERLITZ -- EVE
      Napoleon slowly folds up his telescope.
142   EXT. NAPOLEON'S BATTLEFIELD TENT - NEXT DAY
      EMPEROR FRANCIS arrives and comes to Napoleon's Tent.
      Greetings are pleasant, then they go inside tent....
                            NAPOLEON
                Francis! So nice to finally meet
                you. You must forgive me, this has
                been my only palace for the last two
                months.
                            FRANCIS II
                You make such good use of it!   Seems
                very agreeable...
                            NAPOLEON
                Well, of course, we do what we can
                on the battlefield.
                            FRANCIS II
                Yes we, don't we?
                             NAPOLEON
                Plea se come closer to the fire....
                            FRANCIS II
                Ah, yes, thank you.
                               NAPOLEON
                Brandy...
                               FRANCIS II
                Thank you...
      They are both poured brandy, toast to the Battle...
                            NAPOLEON
                To a well fought battle...
                                                     66.


                      FRANCIS II
          To a well fought battle, yes...
                      NAPOLEON
          Where, may I ask is Alexander?
          Are we waiting for his arrival
          before we get started?
                      FRANCIS II
          No, I don't believe he will be
          joining us, he's down the
          road....perhaps a bit shaken by the
          events....and He's....he Sends His
          Best Wishes for a fine battle....
                      NAPOLEON
          I will need to speak with him.
                         FRANCIS II
          Yes, yes.
                      NAPOLEON
          Perhaps I can send General
          Davout....?
                      FRANCIS II
          .....if you wish.
Napoleon sends General Davout....then back to Francis II:
                      NAPOLEON
          Now....You know as we sit here....I
          realize that I must compliment you
          for making me commit an enormous
          error.
                         FRANCIS II
          An error?
                         NAPOLEON
          Yes.
                      FRANCIS II
          What error have you made?
                       NAPOLEON
          To be speaking with you here and
          accepting this interview for
          peace....I have not followed up my
          victory ....I could have taken the
          whole Russian and Austrian army
          prisoners....
                         FRANCIS II
          ....yes.....
                                                              67.


                            NAPOLEON
                ....but after all, there will be
                less tears....and now I have left
                you more subjects, Emperor Francis.
143   OMITTED

144   INT. TUILERIES - NIGHT
      Napoleon is back, he sits by candlelight with his mother
      Letizia.
                            LETIZIA
                It is time to put this mystery to
                rest, Emperor. I want to know if it
                is you or Josephine. To this end,
                we will conduct a practical
                experiment. At the end of the
                Hallway, waiting for you, undressed
                and ready to receive, is 18 year old
                �l�onore Denuelle de La Plaigne.
                She is a brunette with brown eyes.
                The object of thi s hardly unpleasant
                task is see if you can father a
                child. And then we will have an
                answer to this nagging question of
                who is keeping who from an heir to
                the throne of France.

145   INT. TUILERIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT
      LETIZIA walks Napoleon down the hall by candlelight and
      leaves him. Napoleon opens the door.
146   INT. TUILERIES - BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
      18 year old Elenore is waiting naked for Napoleon under the
      covers. He enters the room.
147   INT. NEW YEARS EVE PARTY - MONTHS LATER
      JOSEPHINE at the party, talking with friends.     She sees
      something across the room....
      LETIZIA comes across the party to find Napoleon and whisper
      something private into his ear (the news that Elenore is
      pregnant.) Napoleon looks overjoyed. ("My son is strong.
      And has full use of his artillery. You will have a child.")
      JOSEPHINE, across the room, sees LETIZIA'S conversation with
      her very hap py son and she knows what's what.

148   INT. TUILERIES - MONTAGE
      Napoleon & Josephine are masked and dancing the waltz
      surrounded by a party. All this over:
                                                              68.


                            JOSEPHINE (VO)
                He is contrary to all his usual
                customs. He is at all functions well
                past his usual bedtime. I asked him
                to wear a disguise and appear among
                the dancers at the Masked Ball and
                he did so without hesitation.
      SEE NAPOLEON in disguise amongst the dancers.
                            JOSEPHINE (VO)
                I have heard, that when he is
                removed from my presence, he loses
                the ease and quiet and displays
                impatience.
149   INT. TUILER IES - FIREPLACE ROOM � NIGHT
      Napoleon and Josephine just sitting by the fire, talking for
      hours about nothing, enjoying each other.
                            JOSEPHINE (VO)
                I am a flower that opens it petals
                and smiles to the sunshine,
                unconscious that the storm is near
                which will lay me low and scatter
                leaves to the heavens.
150   INT. TUILERIES - BATH - DAY
      Napoleon is in the steaming hot bath. Josephine sits with
      him.   The Secretary is here writing dictation.
                            NAPOLEON
                On the matter of twins....for
                purposes of inheritance...which
                should be considered the first born?
                The first in or the first out?
                            JOSEPHINE
                The first out.
                            NAPOLEON
                But the last out was the first in.
                            JOSEPHINE
                The first in would have been the
                first to be conceived..........
      He looks at he r.   She comes to him and kisses him.   HOLD.
                            JOSEPHINE (VO)
                In all the power, in all the
                attention to me or the lavish
                honours he bestows on Eugene...I can
                see my own dark destiny.........
                                                                69.


151   INT. TUILERIES - OFFICE - MORNING
      He is awake early and working.       She is still dressed for bed,
      watching him work.   She says:
                            JOSEPHINE
                When will you insist on a Divorce...?
                            NAPOLEON
                isn't that rich? From the only
                woman I have ever loved and given
                what I've conquered...
                            JOSEPHINE
                I'm too desperate and I'm too old to
                wait for you to tell me what I know
                is coming....
                            NAPOLEON
                then if you insist......
                            JOSEPHINE
                I'll make it easy for you......
                I know that you have a bastard
                child.
                I live in this world, and I am not
                as blind as I pretend to be.
      Napoleon storms out of his office.
152   INT. TUILERIES - OFFICE - DUSK
      Napoleon sits with his DR. COVISART.
                            NAPOLEON
                If I succeed in making the birth of
                a boy who shall be my own son, I
                want you, as a witness to pretend
                the confinement of the
                Empress........
                            DR. COVISART
                Your Highness, You are asking me to
                lie about the status of the Mother
                of your heir...
                            NAPOLEON
                That is another way of putting it,
                yes.
                            DR. COVISART
                Emperor, it is my duty and my honor
                to do what you require of me.
                I promise secrecy but......if asked......I
                cannot contain what I know to
                be the truth.
                            (MORE)
                                                           70.

                            DR. COVISART (CONT'D)
                As painful as it is, the truth is
                that the Empress is no longer
                capable of bearing you a child.
153   INT. TUILERIES - DAY
      Napoleon is watching his STAND-IN get his portrait painted.
      He looks like Napoleon, is wearing his Emperor's outfit and
      is sitting quite still. Napoleon is moody and sullen and
      Talleyrand and Fouche are trying to speak with him:
                            NAPOLEON
                I am not an instigator. I'm not
                born of a Tigress. You suggest
                divorce after years of debate - you
                can see that it has me divided - I
                am NOT ambitious. I have never EVER
                picked a quarrel with anyone.
                                    TALLEYRAND
                You are the greatest leader in the
                history of the World and the World's
                Only Chance At Peace. There is NO
                DOUBT that will be achieved. This
                measure............is about what happens
                ONCE we are there...The Security of
                the Empire depends on an heir.
                            NAPOLEON
                I didn't threaten the Prussians when
                they forced me to go and dethrone
                them at Jena!!!!!

      TITLE: DIVORCE
      Napoleon & Josephine are eating dinner. She's already been
      crying and knows what's coming. They eat in silence.
                            NAPOLEON
                Josephine, my good Josephine, you
                know how I have loved you. It is
                you, to you alone, that I owe the
                few moments of happiness I have
                known in this world. My destiny is
                more powerful than my will: My
                affections must yield to the
                interests of France.
      She cannot control herself.
                            JOSEPHINE
                I expected this; I understand and
                feel for you........
      Napoleon goes to leave and calls to the Servant:
                                                              71.


                            NAPOLEON
                Carry her Majesty to her apartment.
                She will need her daughter and her
                Doctor.
      We HEAR JOSEPHINE SCREAMING AND CRYING LIKE AN ANIMAL.

      A divorce ceremony. Napoleon stood with his arms crossed and
      motionless and speechless.
      A writing apparatus of gold lay upon a small table in the
      midst of the apartment and before it an arm chair is
      placed....
      Josephine enters the room with Hortense. All our main
      players are here to watch, Barras, Talleyrand, etc, etc.
      Cambaceres reads the decree:

      The Articles are continued to be read as Josephine melts,
      signs the official paper..........Cambaceres FADES OUT ON THE
      SOUNDTRACK.....CU. JOSEPHINE.
      It's a few moments later and she is required to read the
      declaration of divorce:
                             JOSEPHINE
                "With the permission of my dear
                husband, I must declare that, with
                no hope of having children, I have

                devotedness that was ever
                given......"
      She cannot continue to read it.   Cambaceres reads it for her.
                            CAMBACERES
                "In consenting to the dissolution of

                blessing of being governed by the

      She watches TWO SWANS on the lake who se home is a small
      oriental temple.
      NAPOLEON comes to visit, watches her at a distance.
      NAPOLEON letter to her at this time.   This could be him a
      scene between them, face to face:
                            NAPOLEON (VO)
                You have shown great courage so far
                and you should maintain it. You
                must not permit yourself to fall

                   You must take care of your health
                   because it is precious to me. Will
                   you write me tomorrow?

      Finally....the Meeting Of Two Great Leaders.
      Alexander and Napoleon meeting, it's been going great......
      DIALOGUE ACKNOWLEDGING BATTLE TO BE ADDED.
                               ALEXANDER
                   I never expected that our friendship
                   would bring me such joy....
                               NAPOLEON
                   ...and laughter!
                   The misunderstandings that man has,
                   with age, can be seen as Comedies,
                   don't you think?
                   We are linked. It is Us against
                   Britain.
                   They are what keeps us apa rt and
                   yet, the joke of it - it is WE who
                   are connected - and THEY who are
                   separate. And the cruel irony? It
                   is THEY who command the Seas. So,
                   how is that - that these pale and
                   crook'd teeth'd Salamanders should
                   keep us apart?
                               ALEXANDER
                   May I call you Brother?
                               NAPOLEON
                   Wouldn't that Be Right?    There is a
                   way to call me Brother.
                   Last night at dinner...I was charmed
                   by your Sister....is she spoken for?
                                   ALEXANDER
                   ......she is to be married to the Duke
                   of Oldenburg.
                                                           74.


                                NAPOLEON
                ......what about her younger sister,
                Anna. Is there a formal offer for
                Anna?
                            ALEXANDER
                She is fifteen years old.
                              NAPOLEON
                yes, I see.      that is a detail.
      BEAT, THEN: (Alexander begged off with Religious differences
      between them.)
                            NAPOLEON
                Our friendship is built on our
                mutual distrust of England!
                When we hold to the Continental
                Blockade we choke them from the
                trade and fight for our most sacred
                rights. That is what is important
                between us! I've just thought of
                something....should I tell you?
                              ALEXANDER
                What is it?
                            NAPOLEON
                Imagine an army of fifty thousand
                men - Russians, Frenchmen
                and...perhaps even Austrians -
                marching by way of Constantinople
                into Asia would have only to reach
                the Euphrates in order to make
                England tremble and bring her down
                on her knees before the Continent.
                            ALEXANDE R
                Your mind works so fast, Emperor!
                Sometimes it's hard to gain
                breathing space!

163   INT. TUILERIES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
      The doors are open for the ceremonial arrival of Napoleon's
      new wife: 19 year old Austrian MARIE-LOUISE. Napoleon
      crosses to greet her and sweep her into a bedroom upstairs...
                             NAPOLEON
                How do I look to you?   Do I resemble
                my portrait?
                            MARIE-LOUISE
                Oh yes. And even more handsome.   And
                strong.
                            NAPOLEON
                And you are even more beautiful.
                Would you like to see the bedroom?
164   INT. TUILERIES - HALLWAY - DAY
      A long, long hallway. It's months later. A NURSE and

      Josephine walks away, cradling the baby. They go for a long

      distance.
      Josephine speaks to the child:
                            JOSEPHINE
                Sweet child, one day you will know
                what I have sacrificed for you.
169   INT. TSAR ALEXANDER'S PALACE - NIGHT
      A sinister and very clear meeting of Alexander with Russian
      Court and Nobility (aka Gangsters) who are speaking the truth
      to Alexander:
                              RUSSIAN COURT MEMBER
                What's good   for your friend Napoleon
                is not good   for Russia....and If It
                Is Not Good   For Russia....it can not
                be good for   His Majesty.
      Alexander begins to see the full scale of the situation.
                              RUSSIAN COURT MEMBER
                It is the Timber Trade with Bri tain
                that makes Russia great.......
                Your Father made the regrettable
                mistake of placing Russia behind
                himself. I don't want to see his
                Majesty become unpopular with the
                Russian people.

                            NAPOLEON
                A battle will dispose of the fine
                resolutions of your friend Alexander
                and his fortifications of sand.
                He is false and feeble.
                            CAULAINCOURT
                Your majesty, his fortifications are
                not sand - they are Snow and Winter.
                            NAPOLEON
                He is false, feeble and sickly.
                            CAULAINCOURT
                Do not underestimate his staff.
                                                             77.


                            NAPOLEON
                Thank you for your advice. And now,
                I would like you go and tell the
                Russian Ambassador that we must ask
                for his passport and to leave Paris.
                If he needs an explanation, please
                let him know that we will be
                terminating the fatal influence
                Russia has exercised over Europe
                these last fifty years....don't
                worry, Old friend...I am only waging
                a political war against
                Alexander...we can soon agr ee when
                he negotiates.
                            CAULAINCOURT
                You cannot ignore my warnings about
                what the Russian winter is capable
                of --
                             NAPOLEON
                -- you're frozen already, my Old
                Friend. Remember this: Alexander is
                a young man, he longs for a taste
                of glory, and like all children, he
                wants to go a different way from his
                Father....he will negotiate once I
                take Moscow.
171   EXT. RUSSIAN LANDSCAPE - DAY
      Napoleon assembling the biggest Army he's ever commanded.
      TO BE WRITTEN: NAPOLEON'S ARMY ON THE WAY TO MOSCOW.
                            NAPOLEON (VO)
                .....My dearest Josephine.....we are
                600,000 men marching into Russia.
                We are 250,000 horses.....
                ..Italians, Neapolitans, Poles,
                Bavarians, Saxons.........my Father-
                In-Law Francis has provided 40,000
                men for operations........and I
                think of you all the while.
                I Have Come To Finish Once And For
                All With The Colossus of the
                Barbarian North.
                Despite careful organization, there
                have been break downs in supply. We
                are suffering sickness, desertion
                and famine. By the time we reached
                Vilna, twenty thousand horses died.
                This wastage is the equivalent of
                two large battles.   I sacrificed my
                most precious weapon: Mobility. We
                are large in numbers but we suffer
                because of it....The Russians
                continue to retreat. I have made my
                Generals too rich.
                            (MORE)
                                                              78.

                            NAPOLEON (VO) (CONT'D)
                They think only of pleasures, of
                hunting, of rolling through Paris in
                their magnificent carriages. They
                have grown sick of war. The very
                danger pushes us on to Moscow. The
                die is cast. Victory will justify
                and save us. My striking force has
                been reduced to 160,000. Moscow is
                now only 200 miles away. To halt
                the campaign at this stage would
                mean a humiliating retreat.
                Tomorrow, we will resu me our
                advance.    We found Russians
                entrenched on the banks of the river
                Moskva near Borodino. This was the
                most terrible of all my battles. My
                guard showed themselves worthy of
                victory and the Russians worthy of
                being invincible.....

172   EXT. MOSCOW - CITY SUBURBS - DAY
      The army is already a mess, having suffered terrible losses
      in battle on the way here....They are sick, hungry, tired and
      expecting a fight in Moscow. They are half the size of when
      the started in men and horses.
      This view of Moscow is beautiful for a moment but something
      is missing.   CU. NAPOLEON he looks at the chimneys.
      There is no smoke coming from any of the chimney stacks.....

173   EXT. THE K REMLIN - MOSCOW - DAY (OCTOBER 1812)
      They stop in front of the Kremlin gates which are wide open.
      Surprisingly, the sun is shining. It's a warm and pleasant
      day.
      Napoleon rides his white charger through the empty streets of
      Moscow, flanked by CAULAINCOURT, EUGENE and Marshals
      BERTHIER, NEY and DAVOUT, and his Imperial Guard.
      An eerie silence pervades.     The windows of the surrounding
      buildings are empty.
      TITLE: MOSCOW, OCTOBER 181 2
                            NAPOLEON
                Three hundred thousand souls live in
                this city.    And they've just
                left.....?
      We PULL BACK to take in a vista of the Kremlin and the onion
      domes of St Basil's. The city is abandoned.
                                                                79.


174   INT. THE KREMLIN - THRONE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
      A door has been left open into the darkened Kremlin.
      Napoleon and his Marshals enter and walk through the
      darkness.
      The Tsar's gilded rooms are empty, abandoned.       Napoleon's
      footsteps echo in the vast empty chamber.
                               NAPOLEON
                   Your Highness Alexander....come-out,
                   come-out wherever you are....peek-a-
                   boo......
      No answer.    He walks to the window, gazing out on the empty
      city.
                               NAPOLEON
                   It's not very s porting, is it?
                   For his honor and Russia's, not
                   mine.
                   There's dignity to be had in defeat.


175   INT. KREMLIN ROOM - THRONE ROOM- LATER

                   He's hiding in St. Petersburg....we
                   will take fight to St. Petersburg...
                               DAVOUT
                   Your Majesty, we are lucky to have
                   made it to Moscow.   There is barely
                   enough to get us back to Poland, let
                   alone another assault.
      One of Napoleon's Guards emerges with a case of wine from the
      Tsar's cellar.

      One of the Guar ds uncorks a bottle and begins to fill
      glasses.
                               NAPOLEON
                   We can wait longer. He will
                   come.......
176   INT. THE KREMLIN -- TSAR ALEXANDER'S CHAMBER -- NIGHT
      Napoleon awakes in Tsar Alexander's bed.       He sits up in bed,
      pulls back the heavy curtains...

      ....and there, on the skyline behind St. Basil's, he sees a
      strange orange GLOW. Then another.
      Napoleon looks closer...piecing it together....EUGENE enters.
                            EUGENE
                (Father), they've set the fires.
                             NAPOLEON
                Who?
                            EUGENE
                It has been started by the Russians.
                            NAPOLEON
                No it hasn't - they're not to burn
                their own city, be sensible - who
                has started these fires -- ?

177   EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - FRENCH CAMP - CONT INUED
      Napoleon and Eugene emerge into the streets.     The whole grand
      army stand staring at the huge fire.....
      Suddenly....those few flurries of snow fall....Russian Winter
      has arrived. Napoleon thinks:
                            BERTHIER
                We can remain only long enough to
                reorganize. We march back to Paris.
                            NAPOLEON
                There is no reason. Alexander will
                negotiate.
                            BERTHIER
                He is not, your Majesty. And you
                must face the harsh view of this
                situation.

                We have let too much time slip
                away...we will be marching into the
                Russian winter, with horses who are
                not raised for this weather.
                             NAPOLEON
                Winter?     This is the Winter they
                promised us?    He will come. He
                will negotiate for he is much more
                embarrassed than I am.
      Napoleon moves back inside....
                            BERTHIER (CALLING OUT)
                If we go back to Poland, we can wait
                out the winter months..... ..

                                                            81.

                            BERTHIER (CALLING OUT) (CONT'D)
                These horses are not bred for this
                weather!   A French horse will die
                within weeks!
                            NAPOLEON
                (So we will eat them)

      Cossacks walk in the woods and flank the Grand Army as it
      marches along the road........waiting to swoop down and kill
      them or waiting for them to move into the woods to look for

      down....some Men don't even fight back....some Fire the guns

      NAPOLEON and EUGENE and CAULAINCOURT around a fire. The
      fighting is just a hundred yards away but they don't even
      look at it or react.......
      Caulaincourt looks at him.
                            NAPOLEON
                All will be well when we arrive at
                Minsk.

181   INT. ZANIVIKI TOWN - NIGHT
      A small town is overrun with soldiers to get inside the wood
      shacks to get any kind of warmth. Soldiers go wild and
      dismantle the homes to use for fire wood.

      Only Napoleon and his Generals ride on horseback.
      Napoleon takes out his pocket scope. THEIR POV: far off in
      the distance, they are being stalked by a group of riders --
      COSSACKS in heavy papaha fur hats.

183   EXT. CAMP - RUSSIAN PINE FORES T - NIGHT
      The WIND HOWLS off the steppes. The grenadiers huddle in
      their horse hides for warmth around a dying campfire. They
      have been reduced to cavemen.
      A CORPORAL'S eyes have drifted closed.     One of the grenadiers
      is eyeing the very weakened soldier.

184   EXT. RUSSIAN TUNDRA -- DAY
      The corpse of the Grenadier lies splayed out in the snow, its
      thigh stripped clean of flesh, next to the embers of the
      campfire where he was cooked and eaten.

      down at the human carcass.

                            CAULAINCOURT
                Your Majesty, it is time for you to
                leave this misery and return to
                Paris and I have found a way.....
      Napoleon sees the sleigh....

                            NAPOLEON
                General Berthier you are left in
                command. I am well pleased with the
                fine spirit you have all
                shown.....Caulaincourt will be
                coming with me.   That is what will
                happen.
      He makes his way to Eugene and kisses him.
                            NAPOLEON
                Good bye, my son. Take care.
      Guards are mid-transfer of rugs and arms and his toilet

                Now we will make time. Our disasters
                will make a great sensation in
                France - but my arrival will counter-
                balance Europe's bad efforts. We
                will show the French people, that
                the Enemy is Russia.

                As a matter of fact, Your Majesty,
                it is you that they fear. It is your
                Majesty who is the cause of
                everyone's anxiety and prevents them
                from s eeing the other dangers.  A
                World State run by you is not what

      The sleigh is flying across the landscape. He looks out and
      glimpses something in the snow that startles him.
                                NAPOLEON
                Stop.   Stop!
      The sleigh driver obeys.     Napoleon stands up in the sled --
      -- all around him are ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BODIES, French and
      Russian soldiers and their horses, frozen in the snow.
                                                            84.

                How long ago was it that we fought
                this battle?
                            SLEIGH DRIVER
                Three months.
      Napoleon climbs down from the sled.   He walks into the
      battlefield --
      -- RAVENS are plucking out the eyes of the dead; wolves are
      fighting over their bones. A frozen French soldier gazes up
      at Napoleon accusingly.

                properties and an allotted annual
                income of one million francs. With

                I am afraid of the criticism that
                will come to me for opening my house
                to the very man who humbled my
                country and my husband.....
                            ALEXANDER
                I understand your fear. If it
                brings you any comfort, it's because
                of me that he has retained his
                title, been given 2 million francs.
                He is neither in prison nor dead.
                Have you seen him?

                would like to come and visit with
                you, starting with the Prussian

      Newspapers arrive. Napoleon gets to the paper. He is
      reading news that is approximately seven days o ld.
      He reads something that doesn't sit well with him. A news
      item about Alexander and Josephine. Or is this in the form
      of a letter from someone else?

      Tricolor of the Republic. Napoleon appears on deck:
                            NAPOLEON
                Good evening. I am here to dissuade
                you from resistance. You know who I
                am.   You don't have to fear me if
                you don't provoke me.
                I have been delivered by Providen ce.
                Louis XVIII/Royalty has driven
                France to failure and ruin. With

                Your chest is congested. Your

                             DR. COVISART
                I would suggest that you cancel that

      The INCONSTANT is anchored 100 yards off shore and boats are
      bringing Napoleon and his men ashore...
      Leathery FISHERMEN watch him arrive. It's all very awkward
      and ungraceful...
                               NAPOLEON
                You know me.     I am your Emperor.

205   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- GRASSE -- DAY
      Napoleon on the move. They march, 500 of them, with Napoleon
      leading the way atop a decent chestnut horse brought over on
      the boat from Elba.
      The villagers all come out and look.
      Napoleon takes off his cocked hat and waves it at them like
      it's some kind of parade.
      A LITTLE BOY breaks free of the villagers and falls in
      alongside Napoleon's horse. He marches mockingly along with
      them, and the villagers LAUGH.
      Napoleon reaches down, lifts the boy up, and gives him a ride
      on the horse.
      Some of the villagers fall into step as well, singing and
      marching: somebody beats a washboard like a drum.
206   INT. TUILERIES - DINING ROOM -- DAY
      A MESSENGER arrives in the presence of the new French
      King....Louis XVIII, the portly Bourbon, who has been
      restored to the throne in Napoleon's absence, who is in the
      middle of his breakfast.
      The messenger bows his head.
                            LOUIS XVIII
                You may speak.
                            MESSENGER
                Bonaparte, your Majesty.

      Louis chews slowly on a boiled egg.
                            MESSENGER
                He has returned. A ship landed on
                the beach in Antibes this morning
                and they are on the march.
                            LOUIS XVIII
                Who's marching where?
                            MESSENGER
                Napoleon Bonaparte is marching
                towards Paris.
      Nervous laughter.   Louis XVII wipes his mouth and slowly
      stands up....
207   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, LAFFREY - MORNING
      Napoleon leads his army on this cold morning.     We come over a
      rise, and the procession stops......
      REGIMENT OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS BLOCK THE ROAD A FEW HUNDRED
      YARDS AWAY.
      It's a stand off. A young COLONEL CHARLES LA B�DOY�RE is
      sent ahead full gallop to speak with Napoleon.
                             LA B�DOY�RE
                Your Majesty.    General Marchand, in
                defense of the Royal Government of
                King Louis XVIII, requests that you
                surre nder your weapons and cease
                your march so that you may be
                arrested and returned to your
                island.
                            NAPOLEON
                Good afternoon to you, Colonel.
                Would please inform General Marchand
                that I will come and speak with him.
                I have no fight with my own 5th
                Army.
      La Bedoyere gallops back and speaks with General Marchand
      From Napoleon's POV - General Marchand ignores this
      information and shouts direction to his 5 th Army.
      The 5th Army front line kneels with its muskets so that the
      second line may fire over their shoulders, multiplying the
      amount of ammunition that can be fired per square foot.
      General Marchand and his Lt. Cambronne steel themselves for
      the volley of hot lead that is to come.
      Napoleon rides his horse towards the 5th Army......
      ....getting closer....100 Ft away......
                                                               90.


      General Marchand calls out:
                               GENERAL MARCHAND
                Make ready!
      500 muskets are simultaneously cocked.      The 5th awaits the
      command to fire --
      Napoleon is upon them....a few yards away.     He dismounts.
      He gazes into the eyes of the regiment before him.
                               GENERAL MARCHAND
                FIRE!!!!!
      No one fires.
                            NAPOLEON (TO TROOPS)
                Soldiers of the 5th Regiment...do
                you recognize me?
                            VOICES
                Yes...Emperor.....yes.....
                             NAPOLEON
                Sold iers of the 5th Regiment....will
                you join me in reclaiming France?
                I have missed you and I am
                melancholy for my home and our
                victories together. I want to come
                home to Paris. Will you join me?
                            VOICES
                Vive L'Empereur!
208   EXT. TUILERIES -- DAY
      PANIC. LOUIS is fleeing the scene with his two dogs and
      heading towards a waiting Grand Coach.
      VALETS and CHAMBERMAIDS they scurry behind him burdened with

209   EXT. TUILERIES - DAY
      Napoleon's arrival, days later. Exhausted but triumphant.
      CROWDS fill the gardens of the Fontainebleau now.
      The white fleur-de-lis Bourbon flag is taken down and the
      hand-sewn tricolor is raised.
      Napoleon ascends the steps of the Palace. Marshals Ney,
      Davout and Talleyrand are there to greet him.

                            NAPOLEON
                And no one thought to notify me?
                            HORTENSE
                No.
                            NAPOLEON
                I want my letters that I wrote her.
                Do you know where she keeps them?
                            HORTENSE
                They were stolen by her Valet.
                            NAPOLEON
                Where did she keep them?
                            HORTENSE
                In the cupboard in her bedroom, next
                to her bed.
                            NAPOLEON
                What did he do with them?
                            HORTENSE
                He sold them.
                            DUKE OF WELLINGTON (VO)
                He is an Enemy of the Human Race....


212   INT. THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA - DAY
      The Powers of Europe, great and small, have assembled here
      for one purpose: to destroy Napoleon.
      Duke of Wellington, Tsar Alexander, Archduke Charles of
      Austria, the monarchs of Spain, Sweden, Portugal, and Louis
      XVIII. And, most importantly: TALLEYRAND.    NEED MORE
      ACCURATE WORDING HERE, SKETCH:
                                                           92.


                            DUKE OF WELLINGTON
                    (reads aloud)
                "Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed
                the only title on which his
                existence depended. As an enemy and
                disturber of the tranquility of the
                world, he has rendered himself
                liable to public vengeance." This
                congregation of Allies will string
                along the French/Belgian border an
                army of 70,000 troops from England
                and 120,000 troops from
                Prussia...Majesty?
                            ALEXANDER
                The Russian Army will bring 400,000
                Men.
                            DUKE OF WELLINGTON
                This blow should have been stuck
                long ago. This man has held the
                world hostage by his ego, his blind
                abuse of power and his lack of
                manners. We will all sleep again
                without him. I believe that I speak
                for all of us when I say that the
                one regret we all share is that we
                allowed this man's existence.

213   INT. TUILERIES - MAP ROOM - DAY
      A VAST MAP OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS (now Belgium)
      is laid out on the floor. Napoleon walks upon it, surrounded
      by his Marshals, including Marshals NEY and La B�doy�re, who
      has joined Napoleon's staff.
                             NAPOLEON
                Strike quickly against Wellington
                and Blucher - defeat them
                separately.
                Disallow them from uniting
                forces...here.    This is what
                Britain does not know how to do that
                I know....t his is a fight on land.
                They have not treated me as the
                Royalty that I am. Treating me by a
                standard they would not apply to
                themselves.
      He indicates a point on the map with the toe of his boot.

       The mist rises off a great expanse, with three small
       FARMHOUSES arranged around a gentle hillock.
       The DUKE OF WELLINGTON walks that hill with his officers.
       We PUSH PAST him, to reveal a line of British REDCOATS

       Napoleon sits on a copper field toilet, his pants around his

       He rises, pulls up his pants, and glances in the toilet.
       Inside is a half-pint of blood. A hemorrhage.

       Napoleon enters as his Marshals stand waiting. Marshal Ney is
       anxious to begin.
                             NAPOLEON
                 I'm not ignoring your warning about
                 the fire power of the English
                 infantry - I am disagreeing with it
                 and feel that a frontal attack is a
                 stronger strategy.....
                             MARSHAL NEY
                 He has positioned himself on higher
                 ground, Emperor. Defense is
                 Wellington's strength--
                              NAPOLEON
                 And it's his only one...The Duke is
                 simply n ot that
                 accomplished...except at defense.
                             MARSHAL NEY
                 ...
                             NAPOLEON
                 He's an ordinary thinker who is
                 adept at doing nothing unless it is
                 done for him...
216    EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- DAY
       Napoleon walks the battlefield. He feeds bread to his troops
       as he rallies them, wishing them good luck and victory.(In
       the BG, a boy exits the tent and empties Napoleon's toilet
       when no one's looking.)
       The ground is damp and soft; his boots are muddy. Napoleon
       evaluates the wet ground with two officers.
                             NAPOLEON
                 We are in no hurry to start this
                 battle.

                             NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
                 We can wait until mid-day when the
                 ground is drier. We cannot move our
                 heavy artillery into place on this
                 mud.
       Napoleon extends his spyglass and peers across the
       battlefield at the British digging their trenches.
216A   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- BRITISH POSITION -- DAY
       Wellington checks the mud that has accumulated on the bottom
       of his pristinely polished boots.
       He evaluates the same wet ground, as his men dig trenches in
       perfect British unison. They are organized and ready.
                             WELLINGTON
                 Well done, men! Now's your time!
                 Now's your time!
       He walks further, encouraging the troops.
                             WELLINGTON (CONT'D)
                 Patience shall win the day today.
                 Hold this ground.
                     (sotto voce)
                 Let him come to us...

219    EXT. BELGIAN ROAD -- DAY
       A lone ENGLISH HORSEMAN with a pair of horses blazes across a
       rough road through open country as he comes in sight of:
       PRUSSIAN INFANTRY, led by General Gebhard von BL�CHER on
       horseback. 110,000 men in unison, moving like a machine.
       They spread out in a vast army of men.
       The English rider, a scout, halts before Blucher's advance
       officers. There is an exchange.
       At a distance, this is witnessed by a- -
       FRENCH SCOUT, similarly equipped with two horses. He studies
       this through a small telescope.
       (Footnote: These riders were the most effective form of
       distant communication during battle. A pony express, in
       effect.)
                                                              95.


220   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- DAY
      The French troops wait for their orders. Napoleon paces in
      the mud. La B�doy�re receives the news of Blucher's imminence
      from the French Scout behind him with two winded horses.
                            LA B�DOY�RE
                Prussian troops have been sighted on
                the road, sire. Twenty miles.
      Napoleon studies the rider and lathered horses.
                             NAPOLEON
                    (shouts)
                You are certain?
      The rider nods, thrilled to be addressed by Napoleon.
                            NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
                Then, they're out of the battle....
      La B�doy�re looks doubtful.
      Napoleon takes out his spyglass again. HIS POV THROUGH THE
      SCOPE: at the other end of the battlefield, Wellington is
      pacing too.
                            NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
                I want reports of Blucher's progress
                every two hours...get on with it.
221   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- BRITISH POSITION -- DAY
      Wellington stakes out a place beneath a great tree and gazes
      back at the French position, unable to locate Napoleon. He is
      surrounded by a handful of LIEUTENANTS.
      The BRITISH EXPRESS RIDER has arrived. He dismounts on the
      run. (He is slower than the French rider.)
                            BRITISH EXPRESS RIDER
                    (saluting)
                Blucher at twenty miles, sir.
      Wellington looks at his pocket watch. He then extends his
      spyglass toward t he French side, clearly scoping Napoleon.
                            WELLINGTON
                    (sotto voce)
                He appears to be...just waiting.
      There is the feeling of two gunslingers, waiting to see who
      will draw first. Wellington's Lieutenants await patiently. It
      is still raining, although only a soft drizzle.
                            WELLINGTON (CONT'D)
                He's excellent at everything...
                    (beat)
                But the one thing he cannot resist
                is an attack...

                            (MORE)

                            WELLINGTON (CONT'D)
                    (sotto voce)
                Let us see how this General can
                attack our position.
      A row of BRITISH SNIPERS, rifles resting on rods with forks,
      are set-up a few yards from Wellington. One has bound a small
      scope to his rifle and is peeking through it. He calls out:
                            BRITISH SNIPER
                    (excited)
                There's Bonaparte, sir. I think I
                can reach him. May I fire?
                            WELLINGTON
                    (irritated)
                No, no! Generals commanding armies
                have better thi ngs to do than to
                shoot at one another.
                    (then)
                Hold your fire, soldier.
222   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- DAY
      It has stopped raining. Napoleon grimaces with pain, but
      conceals it from his Marshals. Then, abruptly, as if trying
      to distract from the pain:


                            NAPOLEON
                Fire cannons.
      THE FRENCH CANNONS FIRE -- a volley more powerful than any we
      have heard before. The Boy covers his ears as he watches the
      cannon batteries, spellbound.

223   EXT. BELGIAN ROAD -- DAY
      The cannon fire can be heard from twelve miles away; the
      Prussian troops are unsettled by the sound. Blucher looks
      concerned, but they remain stoic and march onward.
                            BLUCHER
                We must increase the pace. On the
                double!
                            PRUSSIAN OFFICER
                    (calls out; relayed)
                On the double!

224   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- BRITISH POSITION -- DAY
      The British troops take cover at the French cannon fire --
                              BRITISH LIEUTENANT
                Take cover!
                                                            97.


      -- they burrow in their newly-dug trenches as the cannonballs
      whistle overhead --
      -- and SMASH into the stand of trees behind their lines.

225   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- EVENING
                            GUNNERY SERGEANT
                    (bellows; agitated)
                Lower range! Lower the range!
      The CANNON BATTERIES work in precisely-timed formation,
      firing in unison for maximum effect.
      But, they are still hitting the ramparts above the trenches --
      with only minor damage to those dug into the trenches.
      Napoleon signals and the cannons cease firing. SILENCE. He
      gazes through his spyglass: a cloud of wet particles and
      debris rises from the British position. Only a few Redcoats
      are visible.
                            MARSHALL NEY
                    (impatient)
                Calvary! Now! Emperor, now!
                            NAPOLEON
                Ney! Silence, damnit! Send in the
                infantry. The ground is still too
                soft. We need the higher position...
      Ney is furious at being called out in front of officers.



226   EXT. THE FRENCH INFANTRY - BATTLEFIELD
      Forward orders are given by BUGLE.
      The French Battalion marches across the muddy battlefield in
      tightly packed lines. The British slowly emerge from their
      trenches. They raise their muskets, steady arms resting on
      the ridge of the trenches --
      -- and FIRE. As French soldiers fall, the surrounding troops
      stoically close ranks and continue to advance.
227   EXT. BELGIAN ROAD -- DAY
      The Prussian troops march on, toward Waterloo.   This is very
      bad. Blucher can now hear the GUNFIRE.
                            BLUCHER
                Faster, men! Double time now.
                            PRUSSIAN OFFICER
                That would not be possible, sire!
                                                              98.


       AS:
227A   EXT. BELGIAN ROAD -- DAY
       The ENGLISH SCOUT blazes up to Blucher's army, that are now
       on the double. He receives info, wheels his pair of horses
       around and races back towards Waterloo.
       AS:

228    EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- DAY
       The French Scout appears, leaps off his horse, and reports to
       an officer who runs to Ney. Napoleon stands nearby.
                               NAPOLEON
                   How far?
                               MARSHAL NEY
                   Five miles. Or less.
                               NAPOLEON
                   Damnit. Damnit.
229    EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- BRITISH POSITION -- DAY
       A VOLLEY OF RIFLE and CANNON FIRE from the British trenches.
       More French soldiers fall. Wellington watches it all from
       beneath his tree.
                               WELLINGTON
                   Where's Blucher?
                               BRITISH LIEUTENANT
                   Less than two hours, sir.
                               WELLINGTON
                   Which will come first? Nightfall or
                   the Prussians?
       The scene on the field below is grim.    Smoke, bodies, the
       Earth rent by cannon fire.

230    EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION /BRITSH POSITION -
       - EVENING
       The   sky is black with smoke. Napoleon is in pain. In the
       BG,   Marshals Ney and La B�doy�re are arguing. Ney canters
       up,   gesturing violently at Napoleon, who is doubled-over from
       the   pain.
                               NAPOLEON
                   Very well. Charge. Charge!
       Ney rides to the French Soldiers, addressing them.
                                                            99.


                            MARSHALL NEY
                Calvary! Follow the brave of the
                braves! Charge!
      THE FRENCH CAVALRY CHARGE across the battlefield toward the
      British position, led by Marshal Ney himself. Wellington
      sees them coming.
      They hit soft ground. Wellington gleefully watches horses
      wallow and slow down in the mud. He bellows order:
                            WELLINGTON
                Fix bayonets!
                    (then)
                Wait until you feel their horses'
                breath.
      In unison, we see the Br itish Army fix bayonets to their
      rifles in the hundreds. The British, now like a machine, a
      fortress in motion, form up into INFANTRY SQUARES, their
      bayonets pointing outward --
      -- as Ney's cavalry storms the British trenches, riding in
      and across the French position.
                            WELLINGTON (CONT'D)
                    (bellows from
                     horseback)
                Stand fast to the last man. We must
                not be beat or what will they say in
                England. We mus t hold our ground!
      As the French riders hit on the squares with their sabers,
      the British repel and spook the horses with their bayonets.
      But the bayonets spook the horses and they rear up. Ney is
      forced to wave off his riders, sounding the signal of the
      BUGLE'S RETREAT.

232   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- FRENCH POSITION -- EVENING
      Napoleon breeches are stained with blood. He sees the
      defeated cavalry returning. He rises and telescopes his
      spyglass, and slowly PANS the horizon, when he sees --
      BL�CHER's PRUSSIAN TROOPS approaching.
                            LA B�DOY�RE (O.S.)
                They're here. The Prussians. First
                over the rise, Emperor.
      Napoleon lowers his scope.   La B�doy�re is grim-faced.
                            LA B�DOY�RE
                When our infantry sees them coming
                there'll be pani c--
                                                           100.


                            NAPOLEON
                    (cuts him off)
                Tell them they're ours. Send the
                word to the field. Tell them
                they're reinforcements.
                            LA BEDOYERE
                No one is going to believe that,
                Emperor--
                            NAPOLEON
                Go! They are in blue...Tell them!
                Muddy blue is blue, damnit!
      (Script Note: RS isn't sure if he believes this beat above
      about NB lying to his own army. Let's please review.)
      The Boy is watching the disaster unfolding around him.
      Scattered FIRES burn; the dead and wounded are everywhere.
      Cannons FIRE seemingly at random. Horses are bleeding.
                            NAPOLEON
                Bring me my horse!
      His horse is led around. The Boy watches as Napoleon mounts
      his horse. The Imperial Guards surround Napoleon as they ride
      onto the field. Napoleon visibly sways in the saddle as he
      rides.
      Napoleon sees--
      THE PRUSSIANS, are now seen on the rise. They are comin g at
      us from across the field, rifles poised.
                             NAPOLEON
                Charge!
      The Imperial Guard struggles on ground that is still muddy
      and soft. The Prussians fire, now engaging from the
      southeast. Bullets HISS and whiz around us. Napoleon looks
      disoriented as the Guard and the Prussians clash. The
      bullets strike the bodies of the men around him.
      The order begins to collapse, and the Prussians stream past
      th em. A tight scrum of loyal Guards surrounds Napoleon like
      a bodyguard as the Prussians smash into them.
      The regular infantry turns to see the Prussians in full
      attack mode -- and they panic.
                            FRENCH INFANTRYMAN
                We're lost, boys! You're on your
                own now!
233   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD -- BRITISH POSITION -- EVENING
      Wellington finally has the moment he's been waiting for:
                             WELLINGTON
                Now.
                                                            101.


       His orders are echoed and bellowed as the BRITISH INFANTRY
       emerges from its trenches and CHARGES, formidably marching -
       The French Infantry tries to flee. One of the Imperial
       Guards raises his sword to attack the fleeing infantryman.
                             IMPERIAL GUARD
                 The Guard dies, it does not
                 surrender!
       He is sabered by a BRITISH CAVALRY OFFICER.
       Chaos. A melee of panicking infantry, wild-eyed horses,
       charging Pru ssians, circling cavalry.
       From out of the melee, we find Marshal Ney shouting above the
       din, his face streaked with blood, his eyes and hair wild. He
       is fighting with a broken saber, as it has been snapped in
       half from the battle.
                             MARSHAL NEY
                 Lancers! Where are my lancers?
                 Come see how a Marshal of France
                 dies!
       Napoleon, still delirious, watches Marshal Ney.   He grabs Ney
       by the collar, both on h orseback.
                              NAPOLEON
                     (shouts)
                 Marshal. You are relieved of duty.
       Ney wrestles free from Napoleon and rides off into the night.
       One of Napoleon's Guards sees Napoleon reeling in his saddle
       and turns to his comrades:
                                IMPERIAL GUARD
                 The Emperor!     Get him out!
       The six-man scrum of Imperial Guards escorts Napoleon from
       the battlefield, back towards his tent. Napoleon looks nearly
       unconscious in his saddle.
       One of the Guards takes a bullet to the head and falls from
       his horse. Napoleon's horse bolts with Napoleon listing to
       one side.

234    EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- EVE
       NAPOLEON'S HORSE races Bonaparte away from the field of
       battle, its eyes wild, its nostrils flaring. The glow of the
       distant battle lights up the night sky behind them........
234A   EXT. WATERLOO BATTLEFIELD
       As Wellington now sits atop his horse. He watches the French
       side in chaos.
                                                           102.


                            WELLINGTON
                The battle is mine; there will be an
                end of the war.
235   EXT. FIELD -- AWAY FROM BATTLEFIELD -- EVE
      Napoleon sits on the grass, sheltering in a grouping of
      young, thin trees. He is slightly bleeding. His horse mills
      around him, untethered.
      PRE-LAP SOUND OF CRISP CLACK OF SHOES ON WOOD FLOOR.....
                            WELLINGTON (OC)
                Good afternoon, Your Majesty....
                            NAPOLEON (OC)
                Good afternoon......


236   INT. ENGLISH SHIP BELLEROPHON, OFF ROCHEFORT - DAY
      Napoleon is kept in the belly of this British Warship.
      He is fraternizing with his captors, eating a full English
      Breakfast. They are enamored by him, fully
      engaged....there's a pause and they stand to attention as
      DUKE OF WELLINGTON arrives to speak with Napoleon:
      DIALOGUE TO BE ADDED FOR NAPOLEON & SHIPMEN
                            WELLINGTON
                Would you like a glass of water?
                            NAPOLEON
                The hospitality and forgiveness of
                the British people is what I admire
                in the face of the European
                hostility.
                I imagine I will love the Cotswolds,
                soft rolling hills and gentle
                light......
                            WELLINGTON
                It is by only a narrow margin of
                opinion that you have been spared
                the fate of being shot.
      CU. NAPOLEON this is not the news he was expecting and it's
      difficult for Lord Keith to deliver....
                            WELLINGTON
                Politically, it is impossible for
                the English government to keep you
                in England. You are permitted to
                take three officers and 12 servants
                into Exile.
                                                           103.


                              NAPOLEON
                ...
                            WELLINGTON
                Exile will be contained to the
                island of St. Helena. At the
                residence of Longwood.
                              NAPOLEON
                St. Helena.
                            WELLINGTON
                St. Helena is 1000 miles away from
                the Mainland of Africa. Your
                correspondences will be read. Your
                presence will be checked twice daily
                by the orderly officer....
                            NAPOLEON
                Who would suppose that all this
                would be decided so quickly?
                One must also not forget that I am
                only a man, after all.

237   EXT. SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY
      Napoleon seeing his final home from a distance.   It's a
      volcanic rock of an island.

238   EXT. ST. HELENA - OLIVE ORCHARD - DAY
      Daily life is pleasant but dull.   There are a few families on
      the island.
      Napoleon is warmer, more reflective.
      He befriends a few of the family's YOUNG GIRLS.   He sits
      around, joking with them:
                            NAPOLEON
                What is the capital of France?
                              GIRL
                Paris.
                              NAPOLEON
                Of Russia?
                            GIRL
                Petersburg. And Moscow before.
                            NAPOLEON
                Who burnt it?
                            GIRL
                I don't know, sir.
                                                          104.


                            NAPOLEON
                It was I who burnt it.
                            ANOTHER GIRL
                I believe, sir, the Russians burnt
                it to get rid of the French.
      He laughs and laughs and corrects her.....
239   INT. ST HELENA HOME - BEDROOM
      NAPOLEON laying in bed, looking at a picture across the room
      of Josephine.
                            NAPOLEON (VO)
                I have beaten the enemy. I am tired
                to death. I send you a thousand
                kisses. I am in bed, hopefully I
                will dream of you.
