 1      EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MORNING                       1

        It's a quiet morning in a suburban neighborhood. SOPHIE, a
        twelve-year-old girl, is seated by the patio table, while her
        father PAUL is hosing the lawn. Suddenly a set of keys falls
        from the sky and through the patio table, shattering the
        glass. Sophie is startled, but Paul doesn't seem to mind. A
        shoe suddenly falls from the sky and lands on the lawn. Then
        a person with one shoe falls from the sky, landing right by
        the pool.

                            SOPHIE
                  Dad?

                            PAUL
                  It's OK sweetie.

        Sophie suddenly starts to slowly levitate off the chair.

                            SOPHIE
                  Dad, Dad. Dad, help me!

        She tries to hold onto the chair, but it lifts up with her.
        She keeps getting pulled upwards through thin air, she's now
        several feet up and the chair slips out of her hands.

                            SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                  Dad, please help me! Please help
                  me, please!

        Paul is indecisive, just standing there, unable to act as we
        hear the screams of his daughter disappearing into the sky.


 2      INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING                        2

        We are in an upper middle class home during a weekday
        breakfast. Paul and his wife JANET are listening to Sophie
        retell her dream.

                            SOPHIE
                  And um, I guess ... and then I woke
                  up.

                            PAUL
                  Why didn't I do anything?

                            SOPHIE
                  I don't know.

                            PAUL
                  It's like the third time now, why
                  am I always just standing there?

                                JANET
                      Don't make her feel guilty about
                      her dreams, Paul.

                                PAUL
                      You don't see me that way, right?
                      That's not how you think I'd react
                      in real life?

                                SOPHIE
                      If I was floating?

                                PAUL
                      Remember that time you almost
                      drowned? How fast I reacted.

                    JANET                              SOPHIE
        She was four.                      I remember you telling me
                                           about it.

        HANNAH, their 15 year old daughter, pops her head into the
        kitchen on her way out.

                                HANNAH
                      Bye!

                                JANET
                      Hannah!

        She returns.

                                JANET (CONT'D)
                      Remember you have to be home with
                      Sophie tonight.

                                HANNAH
                      No, that's tomorrow night.

                                PAUL
                      No, the play is tonight, it was
                      always tonight.

                                HANNAH
                      Really? She can't she be alone for,
                      like, a few hours?

                                SOPHIE
                          (sotto)
                      I don't mind..

                                JANET
                      You already agreed to this.

                  OK, fine. Bye!


 3      INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING 3

        Paul is getting ready to leave for work.

                            JANET
                  So, should I just meet you there
                  or?

                            PAUL
                  Yeah probably, I'm not sure how
                  long it'll take with Sheila, so...

                            JANET
                  Are you nervous?

                            PAUL
                  No. Not really. I think it'll be
                  good, I think she'll understand,
                  hopefully apologize, and that'll be
                  that.

                            JANET
                  Can you record it?

                            PAUL
                  Are you serious?

                            JANET
                  Yeah, just the audio. On your
                  phone. I want to hear how she
                  reacts.

                            PAUL
                      (smiling)
                  Wow, so vindictive Janet.. I'll
                  think about it.

                            JANET
                  But, you should go, you're gonna be
                  late.

                            PAUL
                  No, I'll be fine.

                            JANET
                  Have a good one.

                             PAUL
                  You too.

        He gives her a peck and leaves.


 3A     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY - DAY                       3A

        Paul is running through the hallway, late for class.


 4      INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - LECTURE HALL - DAY                    4

        Paul is giving a lecture to his students. There's a projected
        image of a zebra to his side.

                                PAUL
                      So when talking about adaptive
                      strategies, why does the zebra look
                      the way it does? You can spot it
                      miles away, so it's not very
                      functional, right? Any theory on
                      how the black and white stripes
                      could be a benefit?

        He looks around the room in hope for a response. He notices
        two of his students, GRETA and ANDY, whispering about him.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No one?

        He clicks a button for the next slide. This time it's a herd
        of zebras hunched together.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      From what we know, the camouflage
                      isn't effective in terms of
                      blending in with the environment,
                      rather it's about blending in with
                      the herd. You see, predators need
                      to identify their prey, they can't
                      just attack the whole group. So if
                      you stick your head out you make
                      yourself a target. Does that make
                      sense?

        Paul notices the same two people still whispering and
        seemingly talking about him.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Hi. Hey! Focus.

        They just stare at him for a beat, then start whispering.

                                ANDY
                      Is this how it went?

                                GRETA
                      No, it's different now.


                                PAUL
                      Do you wanna share your discussion
                      with the class?

                                 GRETA
                          (to Paul)
                      Sorry, no.

                                PAUL
                      Ok, because you just made
                      yourselves a target by speaking
                      when you weren't supposed to. You
                      get the analogy?

                                GRETA
                      I get the analogy.

                                PAUL
                      Ok. Good. So in contrast, can
                      anyone think of instances where
                      "sticking out" can be an
                      evolutionary benefit?

        MILES, another student raises his hand.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Yes..

                                MILES
                      Mating?

                                PAUL
                      Mating.


 5      INT. RESTAURANT MADRE - LATER - DAY                           5

        Paul approaches AVERY, the hostess of the restaurant, which
        just opened for the day.

                                AVERY
                      Welcome to Madre.

                                PAUL
                      Hi... I have a table... for
                      Paul...?

        The hostess just stares at him for a moment.

                                AVERY
                      I'm sorry, don't I know you?

                      I don't know, do you?

                                AVERY
                      Yeah, I . . .

                                PAUL
                      Well, Osler, maybe? I'm a professor
                      there.

                                AVERY
                      No, I didn't go there. Have you
                      been with us lately?

                                PAUL

                                AVERY
                      Yeah. Okay. Sorry... I'm just going
                      through some major deja-vu or...
                      Brian, right?

 6      INT. RESTAURANT MADRE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY   6

        Paul is now seated alone in a mostly empty restaurant. He
        suddenly remembers to take out his phone and starts an audio
        recording. He puts the phone on the table and after a few
        beats SHEILA arrives, a fifty-something academic with a
        friendly face. She waves and smiles as she approaches.

                                SHEILA
                      Hi Paul, it's so nice to see you.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, it's been too long Sheila.

                                SHEILA
                      I barely recognized you, wow.

                                PAUL
                      Oh yeah? The beard maybe?

                                SHEILA
                      No it's the whole... You know...

        She makes an awkward gesture.

                                PAUL
                      So how long are you in town for?

                                SHEILA
                      Just a few days. Visiting my
                      brother. How's everything with you?
                      You're still at Osler, right?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah I am. And, you're publishing
                      another paper, I heard!

                                SHEILA
                      Oh yeah. We're just doing final
                      revisions now, so it's looking
                      good.

        Sheila starts perusing the menu.

                                PAUL
                      Where'd you end up? Which
                      publication?

                                SHEILA
                      Uh... Do you want to-- Should we
                      look at the menu?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah. Which publication though?

                                SHEILA
                      Uh... Nature.

                                PAUL
                      Nature?

        Paul is starting to sweat.

                                SHEILA
                      Yeah, we're happy about that, I
                      mean it's been a while. So... Yeah.

                                PAUL
                      Why haven't you contacted me?

                                SHEILA
                      What?

                                PAUL

                  colony algorithms?

                            PAUL
                  Sounds awfully similar to my
                  research, no?

                            SHEILA
                  Well, I... Do you mean from grad
                  school?

                            PAUL
                  Yes! You weren't even interested in
                  networks back then, you were all
                  about senescence!

                            SHEILA
                  Yes, I mean, yes, I've expanded my
                  interest over the last thirty
                  years?

                            PAUL
                  Are you using "antelligence." You
                  know I coined that, right?

                            SHEILA
                  I'm not using "antelligence." Look
                  there's a big difference between
                  talking about an idea and actually
                  doing all the work.

                            PAUL
                  No, no I've been working. I've got
                  a book.

                            SHEILA
                  Uh, do you have a publisher?

                            PAUL
                  Well, I want to finish it before I
                  take it out, I don't want to be
                  influenced by any sort of corporate
                  agenda.

                            SHEILA
                  Can I read a draft, or?

 7      INT./EXT. PAUL'S CAR/PARKING LOT - LATER                     7

        Paul is now sitting in his car, alone, listening back to the
        audio recording via the car stereo bluetooth.

                            PAUL (V.O.)
                  "So, this kind of ruins everything
                  for me, Sheila. It's just a
                  complete appropriation. I mean...

                  Can you at least credit me?"

                            SHEILA (V.O.)
                  "There's nothing wrong with just
                  being a professor, Paul. You don't
                  need to be a researcher too."

                            PAUL (V.O.)
                  "Please Sheila, I need this!"

        He stops the recording out of embarrassment and deletes it
        and starts driving.


 8      EXT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER                                 8

        Paul is waiting for Janet outside the theater. There's
        another person out there smoking a cigarette who keeps
        looking at him. It seems like the man is trying to place
        Paul, on the verge of talking to him, but doesn't. Then Janet
        arrives.

                            PAUL
                  Jan!

                      technical. I mean she totally saw
                      my argument, but we didn't fully,
                      you know, resolve it yet.

                      Was she defensive? Did you record

                                PAUL
                      Oh... No, I kind of felt, you know,
                      unethical or whatever. You wanna go

 9      INT. THEATER - HALL - NIGHT                                  9

        A wide shot of the audience watching the play. We slowly zoom
        in on Paul and we can sense that his mind is elsewhere. A few
        rows back, far to the side, there's a woman who keeps trying
        to get a good look at Paul.


 10     INT. THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT                                 10

        The play has ended. Paul and Janet are walking through the
        lobby as they talk about the experience. From deep in the
        crowd we hear someone shouting.

                                CLAIRE (O.C.)
                      Paul. Paul!?

        Paul and Janet stop and turn to see CLAIRE, the woman we saw
        staring at him earlier.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, fifteen years ago.

                    CLAIRE                                JANET
        Well, I'm so glad I ran in to         --I'm sorry. How do you two
        you. You've been on my mind a         know each other?
        lot lately.--

                                PAUL
                      Oh, well, Claire and I used to
                      date.

                                CLAIRE
                      Yeah, wild right? Anyway, you've
                      been on my mind recently.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah? I uh... I haven't thought
                      about you in a while..

                  Okay? Good to know I guess?
                  (Chuckles). Anyway, the reason that
                  you've been on my mind is because
                  you keep popping up in my dreams.

                            PAUL
                  Really?

                            CLAIRE
                  Yeah. Like, a lot in the last few
                  weeks.

        We can feel the tension rising between Janet and Paul.

                            CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                  It's so strange. You don't do
                  anything, you're just there, even
                  if the dream's completely unrelated
                  to you. Like, the other night: a
                  good friend of mine was lying in
                  the street, hit by a car, bleeding,
                  dying in my arms, right? And
                  then... this is just in the dream
                  of course. And out of nowhere,
                  there you are! Just strolling by!

        We see a QUICK CUT of a dream: Claire is crying over someone
        dying in the middle of the street after being hit by a car.
        She turns around to see Paul just standing there, in the
        street, watching, half-smiling nonchalantly.

                             PAUL
                  Wow, I'm--Well, I mean that is so
                  strange.

        Paul looks over to Janet, who's not as bemused as him.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
                  So I don't intervene at all? I
                  don't help out?

                            CLAIRE
                  You're still doing that?

                            PAUL
                  What?

                            CLAIRE
                  Searching for the insult? No, you
                  don't do anything, but it's not
                  like I blame you. I was gonna say
                  that my therapist suggested I reach
                  out.

                  something out. You know:
                  subconsciously.

                            JANET
                  Did -- Did you know he was here?

                            CLAIRE
                  No, no, no. I just happened to see
                  you guys! Which feels like a sign,
                  you know? Synchronicity.

                            PAUL
                  Okay. Okay, Yeah...

                            CLAIRE
                  Do you think we could grab a coffee
                  or something? You know, just catch
                  up and stuff?

        Paul glances quickly over at Janet and back to Claire.

                            PAUL
                  Yeah, we... we could do that. Sure,
                  why not? I mean, you know... Yeah.

                            CLAIRE
                  Should I take your number?

                            PAUL
                  Oh, uh. Okay, yeah.

                            CLAIRE
                  Okay. Put your number in there.

        Claire takes out her phone and gives it to him. He types in
        his number and stores it under his name.

                            CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                      (to Janet)
                  Did you like the play?

                            JANET
                  I did, yeah. Yeah...

        Paul hands her phone back. She looks at his name.

                            CLAIRE
                  What, you changed your last name?

                            PAUL
                  Yeah. I took hers. We thought it
                  was... I thought it was appropriate-
                  - I wanted to.

 11     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT              11

        Paul is brushing his teeth in the bathroom right next to the
        bedroom, while Janet is getting ready for bed.

                            JANET
                  Why'd you get all red?

                            PAUL
                  Well, I was just taken aback by the
                  whole situation. Wouldn't you react
                  the same if some old boyfriend
                  cornered you like that?

                            JANET
                  I don't think I'd turn into a
                  stuttering fool.

                            PAUL
                  I don't think I was stuttering...

                            JANET
                  She seemed really happy to see you.

                            PAUL
                  Well, yeah, but not because... It's
                  because of these dreams!

                            JANET
                  Why are you defending her?

                            PAUL
                  Are you just trying to pick a fight
                  with me right now?

                            JANET
                  No, I'm just nervous what this
                  women will do to you when I'm not
                  there.

                            PAUL
                  "Do to me?" What is she going to do
                  to me? Jump me?

                            JANET
                  Why did you ask if she was married?

                            PAUL
                  I was making conversation!

                      Ok, well, maybe I'm exaggerating a
                      little bit, but I'd be lying if I
                      said I wasn't worried at all.

                                PAUL
                      That's fair. But I'm just meeting
                      her for coffee, that's it. I love
                      you.

                                JANET
                      Have you ever fantasized about
                      other women?

        Beat.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, of course I have.

                                JANET
                      But never cheated.

                                PAUL
                      Oh my god, Janet. Do you really
                      think I'm that cool? Do you think I
                      could handle the emotional burden
                      of having an affair?

                                JANET

                      No. No, you're right...

                                PAUL
                      Just try not to let your
                      neuroticism hijack you.

                                JANET
                      Oh come on, not the gender
                      psychology bullshit again!

                                PAUL
                      We both know you score high in
                      neuroticism, it's best to just own
                      it and be pragmatic about it.

                                JANET
                      Yeah, well you score high in...
                      Assholeness.

                                PAUL
                      I score high in "assholeness"?

                  Yeah, so, just own it. Be pragmatic
                  about it.

                            PAUL
                  How about this: I'll keep it very
                  formal when I meet her, I won't
                  even smile, would that work for
                  you?

                            JANET
                  She might like that.

                            CLAIRE
                  ... Yeah, well, it's just so
                  intense, you know. And I usually
                  don't even remember my dreams.

                            PAUL
                  Wow... I feel like I want to
                  apologize for barging into your
                  head like that.

                            CLAIRE
                  No, it's okay, it's just funny, you
                  know? Anyway, thanks for meeting
                  me.

                               PAUL
                  Of course.

                            CLAIRE
                  There's actually something I want
                  to ask you...

                      Well, I write for this magazine

                      Well, it's just online. It's more
                      like a blog. Nobody really reads
                      it.

                                PAUL
                      What... What sort of stuff do you

                      Yeah, okay. I knew you'd scoff at

                      Sorry I didn't mean to. What, you
                      want to write about me?

                                CLAIRE
                      No, I want to write about the
                      dreams, about randomly seeing you,
                      just that. It's just very on brand
                      for what I do.

                                PAUL
                      I mean... yeah, if you don't
                      portray me as this inadequate loser

                  That's so weird, we're basically
                  having the same dream.

                      I don't know, I don't keep track of
                      things like that.

        Paul, scans the room for anything out of the ordinary.

                                BRETT (CONT'D)
                      You're kind of freaking me out,
                      what's going on?

                      Nothing...

        Paul leaves the office to Brett's confusion.


 15     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER - DAY                15

        The family is eating dinner together.

                                PAUL
                      Can we please put our phones away
                      and have a real conversation?

        Sophie and Hannah both look at Paul with slight annoyance.
        They look over at Janet, but she doesn't budge. They
        reluctantly put their phones down.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      So... How was school today Sophie?

        A smartphone placed on a console table in the hallway starts
        ringing. Paul deliberately ignores it.

                                   SOPHIE
                      Dad.

                                PAUL
                      It's fine, I'll call them back
                      later. Tell me about your day.

                                HANNAH
                      Can you turn the sound off at
                      least?

                                PAUL
                      Yes, I'll do that next time.

                                JANET
                      It'll stop soon.

                                PAUL
                      Sophie? Didn't you guys decide
                      which character you're going to be?
                      For the play? Or-

        It keeps ringing.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Let me just hang up.

        We follow Paul as he walks into the kitchen. He looks at the
        screen. It's his friend RICHARD.

                      That's not allowed!

        He answers and walks further into the living room for
        privacy.

                                PAUL
                      Richard! Hi!

                                RICHARD (V.O.)
                      Is this a good time? Do you have a
                      minute?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, what's going on?

                                RICHARD (V.O.)
                      So... Where do I start.

                                PAUL
                      Wow, it sounds serious.

                                RICHARD (V.O.)
                      No, it's funny. You know sometimes
                      I have these dinner parties, right?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah? Is this finally the invite?

                                RICHARD (V.O.)
                      No, it's... Uh... I just had one.

                                PAUL
                      Oh... OK, and?


 16     INT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT     16

        We see RICHARD, a well-dressed professor, seated at his long
        table for a dinner party with an eclectic group from the
        intelligentsia, all mostly in their 40s and 50s. They're
        listening to NAOMI, a New Yorker type journalist, telling a
        story.

                                NAOMI
                      So, I've told this to my husband ad
                      nauseam, but it's about a recurring
                      dream I've had. Or not so much a
                      specific dream, but a specific
                      person I keep dreaming about.

                                NAOMI (CONT'D)
                      He looks perfectly average, he's a
                      remarkable nobody, who just shows
                      up. He just occupies the space like
                      an awkward guest at a party that no
                      one really knows.

                                RICHARD
                      You mean like Sidney?

        They all look over to SIDNEY, another guest in his 50s who
        actually kind of resembles Paul. They all laugh assuming it's
        a joke, but Naomi responds:

                                NAOMI
                      Yeah, kind of! Yes.

        They laugh again. But then Richard's wife, CARLOTA, enters
        the conversation.

                                CARLOTA
                      I have also ... I've also had that
                      experience. I already told Richard
                      about it. I did, I told you...

                                RICHARD
                      Yes and I'm kind of upset, to tell
                      you the truth. She's dreaming about
                      another man!

                                CARLOTA
                      Yeah, very similar to yours Naomi,
                      except in my case it's this guy
                      that we sort of know, this old
                      friend of Richard's, Paul.

                                RICHARD
                      Well, we went to the same
                      university.
                          (then to Carlota)
                      He's actually not that memorable.
                      He's kind of boring. I don't get
                      why you're so into him.

                                CARLOTA
                          (laughing)
                      I'm not into him!

                                NAOMI
                      What does he look like?

                                CARLOTA
                      Well, he does actually kind of look
                      like Sidney.

        Sophie, Hannah and Janet all react to the sound of glass
        hitting the floor and breaking in the kitchen. They get up.

        Paul's body is on the floor with the phone and broken glass

                  Oh, my God. Paul, Paul! Oh, my God.

        Janet takes it.

        Paul is sitting by his desk holding an ice-pack to the bruise
        on his head as he's checking his Facebook. There's close to a
        hundred message requests. He clicks to see them.

                            PAUL
                  Janet! There's like a hundred
                  messages on here!

        No response from Janet. Paul keeps clicking through.

        Janet walks into the office.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
                  Probably Claire's article. She
                  must've linked it to my profile or
                  something! Somebody wants to

                  This is strange Paul. Maybe you
                  should take a minute and think
                  before you do anything drastic.

        Edited video montage of local news - flashy news graphics and

        Transition to more graphics and Paul's Facebook photo, as we

                  An area man has found himself at
                  the center of a strange "dream
                  epidemic", which scientists are
                  struggling to make sense of.

        They cut to a zoom interview with a sleep scientist.

                                SLEEP SCIENTIST
                      So we actually don't know what's
                      causing this, but it's sort of like
                      a dream version of the "Mandela
                      Effect," which is when multiple
                      people report having the same false
                      memory without any logical
                      explanation. Now, then there's
                      something called "astral
                      projection", right? This is a
                      spiritual type of dream visitation.
                      Scientifically this is dubious, of
                      course, but it has been reported.
                      It's a very interesting time in my
                      field.

        They cut the sleep scientist off, to show info-graphics of a
        poll they've conducted.

                                PAUL
                      But I'm always inclined to think
                      rationally that anything
                      supernatural has to be socially
                      constructed, but this one is...
                      Mysterious. Even for me.

        start clapping as he arrives, and the rest follow suit.

        The whole room is cheering, and some are recording on their
        phones. Paul can't help smiling as he tries to calm them
        down.

                  for the lecture on "kin selection"?
                  Show of hands.

        Around 20% of the class raises their hands.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
                  Ok, the rest of you, I'll give you
                  five minutes before I start the
                  lecture, OK? Ask me anything.

        Andy holds up his hand.

                              PAUL (CONT'D)
                  Yes, you.

                            ANDY
                  How does it feel to go viral?

                            PAUL
                  Hah! Well we can discuss that when
                  we get to memetics later this year.

                            GRETA
                  Why is this happening?

                            PAUL
                  I have no clue! My guess would be
                  as good as yours.

                            ELI
                  Are you gonna do, like, Stephen
                  Colbert or anything?

        Students laugh.

                            PAUL
                  Not a chance. I actually enjoy my
                  anonymity, if you can believe that.

        Paul scans the room again with enthusiasm.

        Another student, ROBBIE, chimes in.

                                ROBBIE
                      I think maybe I had a dream about
                      you but it's like super blurry, and
                      like, I wanna like be better at
                      remembering them... And Uh... How
                      do I do that?

                                PAUL
                      I'm not really an expert here.
                      Keeping a dream journal is a common
                      exercise, but isn't seeing me in
                      class enough?

        The students laugh. More people raise their hands. Paul looks
        at his watch.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Who's certain they've actually had
                      a dream about me?

        Around 15 students raise their hands.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Ok. Let's explore this, this might
                      get us somewhere interesting. Does
                      anyone want to share the content of
                      their dream? Yes, you.

                                ANDY
                      Well uhm... I'm in this forest,
                      wandering around, eating these
                      strange mushrooms. And I'm in like
                      a full tuxedo, for some reason, and
                      there's other people also dressed
                      up, but they're all scared, like,
                      frozen in fear. And then I realize
                      it's because of this really tall
                      man running towards me.


 28     EXT. FOREST - DUSK (DREAM)                                 28

        We see Andy walking around, eating mushrooms, in a full
        tuxedo, passing other people in tuxedos who are standing
        still, facing away from him. Suddenly he hears something, and
        sees a very tall man in the distance, seemingly chasing him.
        Andy runs away, then sits down behind a big rock to try to
        hide, frozen in fear. Out of nowhere, Paul is suddenly in
        front of him just casually walking around.

                      Hide.

        Paul just keeps casually strolling around. There's more of
        the colorful strange mushrooms on the trees around.

                                PAUL
                      Are you talking to me?

                                ANDY
                      Yes, Paul. He'll kill us! Paul.

        Paul sees the mushrooms, takes a closer look.

                                PAUL
                      I've never seen these, beautiful.

                                ANDY
                      No! No!

        We hear the killer off camera, the camera whip pans, and we
        smash cut to:

        The students laugh.

                                PAUL

                      Huh... Interesting... So I'm
                      looking at the mushrooms... Instead
                      of helping.

                                ANDY

                      Oh... I suppose, yeah.

                                PAUL

 30     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - ATRIUM - NIGHT (DREAM)               30

        We're in the main atrium of the university. There's about
        seventy students there, all panicking and screaming because
        there's an earthquake happening. Tables are shaking, people
        are pushing each other out of the way as they panic. Things
        are breaking as they hit the floor and there's smoke
        everywhere.

        A person hiding under a table is eating a dead rabbit and
        another student has her face and arms covered in snails. The
        rest of the students are either running away or trying to
        hold onto whatever they can find. Greta is scared for her
        life, but notices in the chaos of it all: Paul just standing
        there, not bothered by the ordeal. He smiles at her.

                      But that's funny... Interesting
                      one. Anyone else?


 32     INT. GREENHOUSE - DUSK (DREAM)                            32

        ELI, another student, is standing alone in an abandoned green
        house. He takes a tooth out of his bloody mouth, then sees
        that Paul is standing outside watching him.


 33     INT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY (DREAM)                            33

        LEAH, one of Paul's students, is stuck on top of a full piano
        as there are alligators on the floor trying to eat her, in
        the middle of a big living room in a manor house. Paul is
        standing far away just staring at her.


 34     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - LECTURE HALL - DAY                34

        Students laugh again.

                                PAUL
                      It ends like that?

                                LEAH
                      Yeah! That's, uh, all I can
                      remember.

                      one? Maybe where I'm actually doing
                      something?

        They all look at each other, nobody raises their hands.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No one? Ok, well, let's just hear

        They've reached the end of class, and the whole time was
        spent talking about their dreams. A few of the students have
        now lined up by the door to take photos with Paul. We can see
        Paul try to hide his excitement as he poses.

        He looks over, she snaps a photo.

                  Oh my god, delete that.

                            HANNAH
                  No it's fine! I'm just sending it
                  to Kyle.

                            PAUL
                  Who's Kyle?

                            HANNAH
                  Tammy's friend. He doesn't believe
                  you're my dad for some reason.

                            PAUL
                  Oh... You guys are flirting?

                            HANNAH
                  Nooooo... He's just asking about
                  you.

                            PAUL
                  So I'm finally cool, huh?

                            HANNAH
                  Well, I wouldn't go that far.

                  You hear this Janet? She's saying
                  I'm a cool dad now!

                      is actually, like star struck that
                      I know you, you know. She sent me
                      this article and she's like: "Check
                      this guy out, Paul." And I was
                      like: "Uh, that's Paul Matthews. I
                      know his wife."

                      Oh yeah, no thanks, I feel like
                      we're in a pretty good position.

                                JANET
                      Yeah. You know, just, if you wanna
                      bounce ideas, or want some
                      feedback.

                                CHRIS
                      Yeah. No, yeah. I think, uh...
                      yeah. You just want to bounce ideas
                      back and maybe just... yeah.

 38     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - MAIN BEDROOM - NIGHT               38

        Janet is in bed, Paul is undressing.

                            PAUL
                  I thought you weren't on that
                  project?

                            JANET
                  Well, I wasn't, but now Chris wants
                  me on.

                            PAUL
                  Well that's great, I'm happy for
                  you! We also got an invite to one
                  of Richard's famous dinner parties.

                            JANET
                  Really? When?

                             PAUL
                  On the fifth. Can you believe it?
                  After all these years. I was
                  tempted to say no, but I think we
                  should go.

                            JANET
                  Hey Paul...

                              PAUL
                  Yeah?

                            JANET
                  Why do you suppose you're not
                  showing up in my dreams?

                            PAUL
                      (jokingly)
                  Well, because you get the real
                  deal, it wouldn't be fair if you
                  got both.

        Janet doesn't bite.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
                  Are you jealous?

                            JANET
                  I don't know... I mean, rationally
                  I'm not, but...

                            PAUL
                  Maybe I should give you a little
                  visit..

                      What would you want me to do, what
                      would you want to see... In your
                      dream?

                                JANET
                      Wow, uhm... I want to see you...
                      Remember when you wore that Talking
                      Heads suit for Halloween?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah?

                                JANET
                      There was just something about it.
                      Something kinda weird and sexy. You
                      should wear that... And save me...
                      From, like, some situation.

                                PAUL
                      That's your sexual fantasy? The sky
                      is the limit here, and you settle
                      for me wearing a comically large
                      suit?

                                JANET
                      I don't know! I'm not good under
                      pressure! Just show up naked? On a
                      horse? With a huge penis? Is that
                      better?

                                PAUL
                      Who has the huge penis? Me or the
                      horse?

                                JANET
                      You!

                                PAUL
                      I'm doing the David Byrne suit,
                      it's been decided.

                                JANET
                      No, let me think about it.

                                PAUL
                      No, you immediately said the suit,
                      and that's what you're getting.

                                 JANET
                      Fine!
                          (beat)

                  Does that turn you on?

                            JANET
                  Does it "turn me on"?

        They exchange bedroom eyes.

                             PAUL
                  Maybe somebody's dreaming about me
                  right now.

                              JANET
                  Yeah?

        They both start breathing heavier.

                             PAUL
                  Maybe a bunch of people... At the
                  same time.

                              JANET
                  How many?

                            PAUL
                  Hundreds? Maybe thousands?

        They're both enjoying the role play.

                            JANET
                  Oh, that is so irresponsible of
                  you... I can't accept that.

                            PAUL
                  What are you going to do about it?

                            JANET
                  I'm going to make sure you stay
                  right here.


 39     INT./EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT                      39

        - Tristan walks around the neighborhood at night, wearing
        dirty sweatpants and a hoodie. He sees Paul's house.


        - He walks around and tries a back door, which is also
        locked. He notices the glass door by the porch, which he
        discovers is unlocked.

        - He enters and goes to the kitchen, finds a knife, and then
        proceeds to walk upstairs.

        -   He walks up the stairs and heads towards the bedroom.

        - He enters, and is now standing right before the bed
        staring at sleeping Paul.

                                TRISTAN
                      I have to kill you Paul... I have
                      to...

        He starts crying, which wakes both Paul and Janet up, who
        both immediately react.

                                PAUL
                      What are you doing?

        The man is still just crying.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Who are you?.
                          (to Janet)
                      Call the police.

        Tristan drops the knife on the floor, Paul gets up slowly and
        picks it up.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What are you doing in our house?

                      I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

                                  PAUL
                      Get out!

        Sophie, who is now awake and standing in the hallway, starts
        screaming. Hannah comes out of her room too.

                                SOPHIE
                      Oh, my god.

                  kill you.

        Tristan suddenly has a fit, lies down on the floor and
        screams. Paul is worried and perplexed, unable to act.


 40     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING                 40

        Paul and Janet, now dressed and tired, are at the dining
        table drinking coffee. DAVID, a police detective, sits across
        from them.

                            DAVID
                  He's had manic episodes in the
                  past. It seems that he stopped
                  taking his medications.

                            PAUL
                  So what's going to happen to him?


                            DAVID
                  Psych evaluation, date with a
                  court, and then a judge will
                  decide.

                            PAUL
                  So he might be back out?

                            DAVID
                  After possibly serving a sentence,
                  yes.

        Paul and Janet exchange worried looks.

                            DAVID (CONT'D)
                  You know, fame can come with some
                  less-than-desirable side-effects.

                      Strangers might want to talk to
                      you, some of them might be mentally
                      unstable, you should be prepared
                      for that.

                                PAUL
                      I'm not getting a gun.

                                DAVID
                      Well, I'm not necessarily talking
                      about weapons. You have no alarm in
                      the house, and you had an unlocked
                      entry point. That makes you
                      vulnerable. You could consider a
                      dog.

                                PAUL
                      Sophie, our daughter, is allergic.

                                DAVID
                      Well, then you may want to consider
                      moving to a new house, keep your
                      phone number and address unlisted.

                                JANET
                      No, we're not moving. I grew up in
                      this house.

                                 DAVID
                      Security cameras. Tasers.
                      Strengthening your deadbolts.
                      Securing your windows. Self-
                      defense classes. It seems like you
                      were pretty helpless in this
                      situation.

        MONTAGE: As we keep hearing this dialogue    we see Janet and
        the police officer walk around the house,    both inside and
        out, to look for potential weaknesses and    possible
        improvements. Paul feels weak next to the    composed officer
        and keeps a little distance.


 41     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING    41
        The detective has left. Paul and Janet are now alone in the
        front hallway.

                                JANET
                      Maybe we should cool this thing
                      off. You know, this is why I was
                      skeptical in the first place.

                      Oh, you knew specifically that this
                      would happen?

                                JANET
                      This kind of thing, Paul. Strange
                      consequences...


 42     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - BRETT'S OFFICE - DAY               42

        Paul is in conversation with his colleague Brett in private.

                                BRETT
                      I think she's right. Take it as a
                      warning. I really feel like you're
                      playing with fire here.

                                PAUL
                      What do you mean? What am I doing?

                                BRETT
                      Going on TV, playing along with the
                      story, this thing is clearly
                      working like catnip for lunatics.

                                PAUL
                      What do you mean "playing along"?

                                BRETT
                      Do you actually believe people are
                      randomly dreaming about you? You
                      don't think it's because you're
                      popping up all over the news and
                      one the internet?

                                PAUL
                      Well yeah, maybe that accounts for
                      some of it, but it doesn't really
                      explain everything.

                                BRETT
                      Ok, so you think something magical
                      is happening?

                                PAUL
                      Well, why is it just me? Why not
                      you, or anyone else for that
                      matter?

                                BRETT
                      So you believe in metaphysics if it
                      proves you're special?

                                PAUL
                      No. I don't know, I'm still
                      processing it, but that guy was
                      just some delusional man with his
                      own wild ideas, I don't think
                      that's going to be a recurring
                      event.

                                BRETT
                      But why risk it?


                                PAUL
                      Well if people know who I am it's
                      just easier to for me to get my
                      foot in the door.

                                 BRETT
                      Which door are we talking about
                      here Paul?

                                PAUL
                      A publisher. For the book I wanna
                      write?

                                BRETT
                      Oh, Ok. Am I sensing a little
                      midlife crisis here?

                                PAUL
                      Oh come on, you're the one who just
                      bought a fucking Kawasaki!

                                BRETT
                      Ok, calm down.


 43     INT. NYC - CORPORATE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAYS LATER - DAY   43

        Paul is waiting in a comically modern chair in the lobby of a
        high rise building belonging to a talent agency. MOLLY, an
        assistant in her mid twenties, comes out of the elevators to
        pick him up.

                                 MOLLY
                      Paul?

                                 PAUL
                      Hi, yes.

                                MOLLY
                      Hi, I'm Molly. They're ready for
                      you upstairs.

                      Great.

        They enter the elevator together.


 44     INT. NYC - CORPORATE BUILDING - ELEVATOR -CONTINUOUS- DAY 44

        They're alone in the elevator and an awkward silence emerges.
        Molly starts laughing.

                                PAUL
                      What?

                                MOLLY
                      It's nothing.

                                PAUL
                      No, come on.

                                MOLLY
                      It's just... Really weird to see
                      you in real life.

                                PAUL
                      Oh, you've been--

                                MOLLY
                      -- Nonstop. Every night. It's
                      crazy, man.

                                PAUL
                      Wow. Well, I hope I'm... Behaving.

        She laughs again.

                                MOLLY
                      Well, no... You're not. No. Not at
                      all.

        Ding! Elevator door opens.


 45     INT. NYC - CORPORATE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     45

        TRENT is sitting by the end of the conference room table with
        his colleague MARY, when Molly and Paul walk in.

                                MOLLY
                      I got Paul here.

                                TRENT
                      Paul, Trent. Hey. I have been
                      dreaming about this meeting.

                                PAUL
                      Aw, yeah, me too.


                                   TRENT
                      Really?

                                PAUL
                      Oh you mean-- literally dreaming?

                                TRENT
                      You know I've actually had dreams
                      about this very meeting. I think
                      they were just normal dreams
                      though, not part of the whole
                      "who's this weird guy in my
                      dreams".

                                PAUL
                      Oh -- I'm weird?

                                TRENT
                      No, I mean.. You're not weird. No,
                      the whole thing is weird. Right? I
                      mean, Molly's dreams have been
                      nuts.

                                   MOLLY
                      Trent!

                                TRENT
                      You wanna talk about weird. But
                      this is my colleague Mary Wiggins.

                                   MARY
                      Hi, Paul.

                    Well, things have been pretty
                    different since, you know, since
                    the dreams started.

                              TRENT
                    Yeah, how fun is that? I mean, I
                    wish I was the one people were
                    dreaming about.

                              MARY
                    Me too!

                              PAUL
                    Yeah, no, it's something.

                              TRENT
                    Well, we're...we're just so excited
                    to have you here.

                              MARY
                    Oh, yeah, we're really fired up.
                    It's probably really overwhelming,
                    right, to walk into a room like
                    this, it's like: "who are these
                    people? What am I doing here?"
                    Maybe we should back up and just
                    talk about what we do.

                              TRENT
                    Yeah, yeah, so we started
                    "Thoughts?" earlier this year, so
                    we're a pretty new agency, and we
                    focus mostly online -- sort of
                    trying to holistically pair brands
                    and more, shall we say
                    unconventional celebrities, if that
                    makes sense? And I think of you,
                    right now, in this moment, Paul, as
                    the most interesting person in the
                    world.

        Paul laughs.

                              TRENT (CONT'D)
                    I mean it! I mean it. And we don't
                    just throw that around.

                              MARY
                    No we really don't throw that
                    around.

        Paul looks over at Molly who is gazing at him.

                            TRENT
                  I mean, the advantage that you
                  have, Paul, is that your impact is
                  not just tied to any one social
                  arena. I mean, you're not just
                  famous for people on TikTok or for
                  people who read, say, The New
                  Yorker. You're in people's minds,
                  when they sleep, which means that
                  anyone who's dreaming, you know,
                  could be your audience.

                            MARY
                  How amazing is that? Who can say
                  that?

                            TRENT
                  You know, is that a big enough
                  audience? So, you know, we've been
                  brainstorming a bunch of cool ideas
                  that we want to talk about with
                  you. But before we get into any of
                  that, we were just kind of curious
                  what you're thinking. Where do you
                  want to go? What do you want to
                  achieve? What are your "dreams"?

                            MARY
                  What are your "dreams"?

                            PAUL
                  Well, I've been meaning to write a
                  book for a few years now. I just
                  never found the time.

                            TRENT
                  Ok, so you're a writer? That's
                  awesome. You know, we talked about
                  selling your life rights to a movie
                  studio actually.

                            MARY
                  Oh because with all the buzz around
                  this, I think we could probably get
                  a six figure deal. And that's life
                  rights.

                            PAUL
                  Really? Life rights?

                            MARY

                            TRENT
                  Anyway, here's somewhere cool that
                  we thought might be a good place to
                  start. Sprite.

                              MARY
                  Sprite...

                              PAUL
                  Sprite?

                            TRENT
                  Yeah, they want us to run their
                  social, I think somebody over there
                  must have lost their minds or
                  something, but they're down to go
                  pretty weird with it. So we thought
                  it could be fun if maybe they,
                  like, tweet a new photo of you
                  every night, holding a can, with a
                  fun little caption, just to really
                  manifest that connection in
                  people's minds and to hopefully
                  alter the phenomenon, at least
                  temporarily, to make people dream
                  about you and the product,
                  together.

                            MARY
                  How amazing would that be, right?
                  And if we couldn't figure that out
                  we could always just suggest that
                  it did work, and we could build
                  stories around that.

                            TRENT
                      (to Mary)
                  Yeah, absolutely, I mean if we fail
                  all-together then we... that's kind
                  of a fun story, too. You know, like
                  we tried to make people dream about
                  Sprite and it didn't work. I mean,
                  it's so dumb, that it's kind of
                  cool. You know, it kind of works.

                            PAUL
                  Can I just--

                              TRENT
                  Yeah?

                            PAUL
                  Can we go back to the book?

                  What book?

                            PAUL
                  My book. The book I want to write.
                  I just want to make it clear that I
                  actually don't want this whole
                  phenomenon to be what I'm known
                  for. I don't want that to be the
                  main thing on my Wikipedia, you
                  know?

                            TRENT
                  Ok... So... What are you thinking?

                            PAUL
                  Well, I'm an evolutionary
                  biologist. That's what I've
                  dedicated my life to. So whatever
                  we do, I want it to be related to
                  my doctorate.

                            MARY
                  Wow, wow. Ok see I didn't know
                  about that at all.

                            TRENT
                  Well, you're famous for the dreams,
                  right? I mean that's why anyone's
                  interested. So it might be a bit of
                  a stretch to get you into a totally
                  different space.

                            PAUL
                  I'm a tenured professor, I'm
                  already in "the space".

                            TRENT
                  Ok, well...Just to give us a point
                  of contact as to what we're talking
                  about, who are some of the big
                  names that you like, in that space?

                            PAUL
                  Well. There's a bunch. Robert
                  Sapolsky, his career has been
                  pretty admirable.

                            TRENT
                  Oh is he, um... No, I don't think
                  I'm familiar with him, actually.

                            PAUL
                  Herman Tig maybe?

                  Herman Tig.

                            MARY
                  Yeah, I know that name.

                            PAUL
                  Oh, you do?

                            TRENT
                  Well, these are not really
                  celebrities I suppose.

                            PAUL
                  No. that's the point. I don't care
                  about fame, I just see this as an
                  opportunity to get some recognition
                  for my work, you know? One door
                  opening another door.

                            TRENT
                  Yeah, no I get that you're talking
                  about an audience pivot... which I
                  think is very smart, I just don't
                  know if you can pivot that hard
                  right now without a significant
                  drop-off. I mean a book about...
                  What? Plants?

                            PAUL
                  Yeah, well I'm not really
                  interested in doing Sprite ads.

                            TRENT
                  No, no, no. Well that's just one
                  example, though, Paul, we have a
                  ton of ideas.

                            MARY
                  Oh, that is just the very tip of
                  the iceberg, we have so many
                  ideas... Um, one idea we had was to
                  make Obama dream about you. That
                  would get you into some of those
                  "high culture" spaces you've been
                  mentioning. I know Malia, so we can
                  make it happen.

                  Maybe this isn't really what I'm

                  really speaking the same language
                  here...

                            TRENT
                  No, Paul... If that's how you're
                  feeling, then I'm failing, ok? Can
                  we just... Can I... can we start
                  over?

        Trent turns around, away from Paul. Molly and Mary are
        confused, they haven't seen Trent like this before. While
        Trent is still facing away, Paul feels like he needs to say
        something.

                            PAUL
                  I just thought you guys could help
                  find a publisher.

        Trent turns back around.

                            TRENT
                  First off I would like to
                  apologize... I lied earlier. I
                  never dreamed about you, I just
                  thought that would be a fun way to
                  start the meeting. Ok but what is
                  absolutely true is that I have been
                  thinking about you a lot, and I
                  just really feel that we're gonna
                  do something very special together.
                  So let's just say we move forward
                  with your plant book..

                            PAUL
                  I never said anything about plants.

                            TRENT
                  Oh no. Your... your book, about..
                  Evolutionary...?

                  It's about ants.

                  Yes. I just... I really want to
                  work with you Paul... I mean, like
                  I said... "Most interesting person
                  in the world".

                            PAUL
                  Ok, but then... no ads, no Sprite.
                  We're focusing on the book.

                            TRENT
                  Yes. And you know, if you're not
                  feeling Sprite, we'll respect that,
                  I would just ask in return that you
                  hear out our pitches and just keep
                  an open mind, you know, especially
                  with things like Sprite because,
                  you know, the door is kind of wide
                  open there, right now. And they're
                  ready to have that conversation
                  with you.

                            MARY
                  And that door closes, I'll just
                  say.

                             PAUL
                  Yeah ok.

                      They were so great! They really
                      know their stuff. They're gonna set
                      me up with a publisher, get the
                      book rolling.

                                JANET
                      Oh wow! That's great! Now you just
                      have to write it.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah... Of course.

                                JANET
                      So what did they say?

                                PAUL
                      They called me "the most
                      interesting person in the world
                      right now."

        Janet starts laughing.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What?

                                JANET
                      No... Nothing. I'm sure that's very
                      flattering.

                                PAUL
                      No, they specifically said they
                      didn't just throw that around.

                                JANET
                      Okay.

                                PAUL
                      I don't think they were just saying
                      it to make me feel good Janet,
                      They're already talking to big
                      clients who want to work with me.

                      Like.. I mean, and this was just
                      one example, but they mentioned
                      Sprite--

                                JANET
                      Sprite? You're gonna work with
                      Sprite?
                          (to someone else)
                      I'll be right there.

                                PAUL
                      Who's there?

                      Chris. Our deadline is tomorrow, so
                      we're just here finishing up.

                                PAUL
                      Right. Where are the kids?

                                 JANET
                      They're out trick or treating...
                      With Kyle.

                                PAUL
                      Oh, Kyle. Ok.

                                JANET
                      Yeah, well, congrats Paul. I'll see
                      you tomorrow then?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah... Ok. Well, they also talked
                      about Obama too... Like, maybe
                      he'll dream about me?

                                  JANET
                      Ok...?

                                PAUL
                      I...I'm just saying it wasn't just
                      Sprite.

                                JANET
                      You don't have to impress me Paul.

        They hang up. Paul is just sitting there.


 48     INT. NYC - HIP BAR - NIGHT                                 48

        That night, Paul has met up with Molly at a trendy hipster
        bar in the lower east side of Manhattan. The clientele are
        mostly in their late twenties or early thirties. Paul and
        Molly are seated at a table drinking cocktails. There are
        Halloween decorations and some of the patrons are dressed up
        in spooky outfits.

                             MOLLY
                  Did you read that article about
                  people dreaming backward in
                  Australia?

                            PAUL
                  No?

                            MOLLY
                  It wascause of, like, the
                  gravitational pull or something?
                  They mentioned you in it so.

                            PAUL
                  How do they dream in China then,
                  upside-down?

        Paul laughs at his own joke. Molly blushes a bit.

                             MOLLY
                  So, how long have you been a
                  professor?

                            PAUL
                  Oh wow, I think... what... about
                  twenty years...? Since ninety-six.

                            MOLLY
                  I was born in ninety-six!

        Paul looks over to the bartender.

                            PAUL
                  Check please!

        Molly doesn't get the joke. She turns around as if confused
        if he's actually getting the check.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No, no I'm kidding... Like, you're
                      too young for me...

                                MOLLY
                      Aren't you married?

                                PAUL
                      No, I wasn't implying... it's a
                      joke.

                                MOLLY
                      Yeah, no, I mean, I get it...

                                PAUL
                      Oh... Ok. But, yeah I am married...
                      How about you?

                                MOLLY
                      No, I'm not really seeing anyone or
                      anything. I'm focusing on my career
                      right now, you know?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, you mean with the agency?

                                MOLLY
                      You hated it so much didn't you?

                                PAUL
                      No, it's just... It kind of felt
                      like...

                                MOLLY
                      A cult?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, sort of.

                                MOLLY
                      I mean, I tried telling them: "he's
                      a super smart professor, he's gonna
                      see through the bullshit." But
                      honestly though, like the Sprite
                      thing is cool, you should do it.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah? I'm struggling to imagine
                      anyone seeing my face and
                      immediately craving a Sprite.

        She gives a flirty look.

                            PAUL
                  Can I ask you something?

                  I felt like you implied something
                  earlier... About your dreams...

        She blushes.

                            MOLLY
                  It's embarrassing...

                            PAUL
                  Well it's just dreams, I won't
                  judge... You don't really get to
                  decide what happens... So...

                            MOLLY
                  Uh...Well... uhm... We fuck.

        Paul blushes.

                             PAUL
                  Really?

                            MOLLY
                  I have the most intense sex dreams.
                  Usually I'm, like, home and it's
                  late and I'm alone and I'm watching
                  TV or something. And then ...


 49     INT. NYC - MOLLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (DREAM)              49

        Molly is in her kitchen, dressed in a sweatsuit and slippers.
        She pours herself a glass of wine and walks over to the
        living room area. She sits down on the couch and continues to
        watch TV. She looks over to a dark corner of the apartment
        where she suddenly notices what looks like the silhouette of
        a person.

                      Is someone there? Who are you?

        The person just stands there.

                                MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      Hello?

        Paul slowly emerges from the dark corner. Molly is startled.

                                MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      Who are you, how did you get in
                      here?

        Paul walks over to her calmly. Molly responds with a calm
        voice:

                                MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      Please, don't hurt me.

        Paul sits down on the couch next to her and licks her
        earlobe. Molly closes her eyes and moans. Paul moves his hand
        down towards her crotch.

                                MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      I'm so wet.

        They start making out.

        Paul is sweating listening to this story. Molly is suddenly
        embarrassed again.

                                MOLLY
                      I'm sorry, I've had like, one drink
                      and I'm like, no filter.

                                PAUL
                      No no, it's fine, it's fine.

                                MOLLY
                      No, it's so graphic, I'm sorry.

                                PAUL
                      No, I'm glad you told me. Usually
                      what I hear is that I'm just...
                      Passively hanging around. Kind of
                      nice to hear I'm doing something.

                                MOLLY
                      Yeah, I guess I'm lucky.

                                MOLLY
                      No, it's sooo good, trust me.

        QUICK CUT: We see a second of the dream scenario of Paul
        having passionate sex with Molly on her couch.

        Paul's heartbeat rises.

                                PAUL
                      Do you want another drink? I need
                      another one. Martini, right?

        Paul gets up. He's getting anxious.

                                MOLLY
                      Dirty.

                                PAUL
                      OK.

        Paul walks over to order. As he stands by the bar he looks
        back over to Molly. She's checking her phone. Paul keeps
        staring, and suddenly Molly turns over and smiles, he quickly
        turns back towards the bartender. He orders two more drinks.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Can I get another cabernet and one
                      martini, please?


 51     INT. NYC - HIP BAR - LATER - NIGHT                         51

        They are a few drinks deeper in the conversation. There's a
        bigger crowd in the bar now, more noise around them.

                                PAUL
                      ... And that's the thing with the
                      zebras. The camouflage is for
                      blending in with the herd. Because
                      the lion can't hunt the whole
                      group, it has to identify a single
                      target... Right?

        Paul notices Molly not paying attention.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What?

                                MOLLY
                      Sorry, but those people are staring
                      at us.

        seem fixated on him.

                      I mean, at you obviously.

                                MOLLY
                      Why? What's wrong?

                                PAUL
                      No, I mean... I just don't want,
                      you know, any rumors... I mean, if
                      I'm meeting Obama... And...

                                MOLLY
                      What do you mean?

                                PAUL
                      No, I mean... I'm, I'm not used to
                      this.

                                  MOLLY
                      Should we...... Uhm...

                                 PAUL
                      What?

                                MOLLY
                      I can't get it out of my head, and,
                      I'm here with you and so... Ok,
                      fuck it: can you do me a favor?

                                 PAUL
                      What?

        A 30 year old guy dressed up as Paul, bald piece and all, for
        Halloween walks in. It startles Paul.


 52     INT. NYC - MOLLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       52

        We hear a key at the door and we see Molly and Paul enter her
        apartment. They're both a bit drunk. Molly flips the light
        switch and walks over to the kitchen.

                                MOLLY
                      Yeah, so this is me.

        She takes out a bottle of wine and pours two glasses.

                      It's nice... Small... And nice.

                                MOLLY
                      Well, I don't have rich parents,
                      so...

                                PAUL
                      No, it wasn't a jab, I mean, it's
                      cozy. You've done a good job.

                                  MOLLY
                      Sit down.

        She gestures him towards the couch. He takes a seat. She sits
        next to him. They both take a sip of the wine.

                                  PAUL
                      So...

                                  MOLLY
                      So...

        They look at each other. Molly laughs.

                                  MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      So... This is insane. You have no
                      fucking idea how crazy this is to
                      me.

                                PAUL
                      I shouldn't even be here.

                                MOLLY
                      No, please, don't leave.

                                PAUL
                      I think I'm a bit drunk.

                                MOLLY
                      Me too. Just stay. Please... You
                      just got here, just stay for a
                      second.

        Paul scans the room and sees a bike.

                                PAUL
                      Is that a... Fixed gear?

                                MOLLY
                      Uhm... No. It's like a... Regular
                      one...

                            MOLLY
                  Oh, Uhm. Okay. I feel like I want
                  to change first, is that cool?

                               PAUL
                  Sure.

                            MOLLY
                  Okay two seconds.

        Molly leaves to her bedroom. Paul spends the moment doubting
        his actions, gets up from the couch, but suddenly she comes
        back in a sweatsuit and slippers, just like in her dream.

                            MOLLY (CONT'D)
                  Everything good?

                            PAUL
                  Yeah... Uhm... So... Where do you
                  want me?

                            MOLLY
                  Could you remove your jacket?

                               PAUL
                  Uhm, sure.

        Paul removes his jacket.

                            MOLLY
                  Okay, now would you stand in that
                  corner over there?

                            PAUL
                  Over there?

                               MOLLY
                  Yeah.

        Paul walks over to the corner.

                            MOLLY (CONT'D)
                  Get all the way up against the
                  wall.

        Paul does what she says and fades into the darkness of the
        corner as he presses up against the wall with his back. We
        can barely see him, just like in the dream. Molly starts
        breathing heavy.

                  just go on for a little more?

                            PAUL
                  Just... You know... I'm married.

                            MOLLY
                  I know, we can stop any time you
                  like, just please, Let me just..., a
                  little longer.

        Beat.

                            PAUL
                  Okay.

                            MOLLY
                  This time, please don't speak this
                  time. Just do the dream.

        Paul leans back in to the corner again. Molly starts
        breathing heavier. He stands there for a good minute, then he
        walks out of the corner towards her, still in character.

                            MOLLY (CONT'D)
                  Who are you?!

        She moans a little. He sits down right next to her.

                            MOLLY (CONT'D)
                  Please don't hurt me.

        Paul doesn't know what to do next.

                            MOLLY (CONT'D)
                      (whispering)
                  Touch me.

        Paul is conflicted, hesitant, but finally moves his hand
        slowly over her thigh and up to her crotch. Molly moans even
        louder. Paul is starting to sweat, his forehead now dripping.
        She's waiting for him to do something.

                            PAUL
                  What?

                            PAUL
                  Yeah? What... What do you want?

        She stares at him for a beat and then starts making out with
        him. He follows her lead. Then she starts removing his belt,
        and at that moment Paul involuntary farts.

                            MOLLY
                  Oh.

                            PAUL
                  Ok.

        Molly reaches back to continue. She moves slowly and
        sensually, she continues removing his belt, and Paul then
        prematurely ejaculates.

                            MOLLY
                  Did you just cum?

        Paul farts again, he's incredibly embarrassed. He has no
        words, he takes his jacket and leaves.


 53     INT. NYC - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                               53

        Paul is lying in his hotel bed later that night. A clock
        indicates 4:33 AM. He's not able to sleep at all. He takes
        the clock, throws it against the wall in anger and
        frustration and tries to force himself to sleep. We see him
        slowly falling asleep, his face twitching a bit.

        - Sophie is sleeping. Her hand starts twitching. We see a
        QUICK FLASH of Paul coming out of her closet in an eerie way
        and walking towards her fast. She screams.

        - Sophie wakes up with a jolt. She's scared. She walks over
        to the closet. She hesitates but opens it, and no-one is in
        there. She goes back to bed but can't sleep.

        Paul is back home from the airport, his travel bag next to
        him on the floor as he's reading from the latest Nature
        magazine.

                            PAUL
                  Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Yeah, you�� Fuck!

        He slams the magazine onto the table to show a page with the
        headline: "Sheila Harper's "Antelligence theory" changes the
        way we understand the hive mind." There's a photo of her
        smiling underneath.

        Greta's face turns pale, she removes the chain and lets Paul
        in. Once inside he freezes, mute, for a few beats. Greta
        seems confused.

                      mistake. You shouldn't have done
                      that.

                                GRETA

        Paul stares at Greta for a few beats, then rushes over and
        starts strangling her. There's a fight. He pushes her up
        against the wall, she struggles, they end up on the floor. He
        keeps strangling her, her face now turning red as she's
        gasping for air. Her eyes tear up. He keeps going, putting
        even more pressure on. Eventually her life fades out of her
        body, she stops breathing.

        The students look at each other.

                            ROBBIE
                  I'm not really sure.

 61     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY - NIGHT (DREAM)           61

        Andy is walking through the hallway alone, late. He's the
        only one left in the building, and there's an eerie feel to
        it. Suddenly, out from one of the classrooms, Paul comes
        running into the hallway with a hammer in his hand, smashing
        it over Andy's head who falls to the ground. Andy immediately
        has a seizure, Paul leans down and flips him around, looks
        him in the eye and continues to hammer his face in.


 62     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - BRETT'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY      62

        Paul is shocked by the story. What we just saw was the
        retelling of Andy's dream.

                            PAUL
                  I'm shocked.

                            BRETT
                  Yeah, and they got worse, some are
                  even sexual in nature, so they
                  don't feel comfortable being in
                  your classes right now.

        Scattered throughout their conversation we see little flash
        cuts of the student's nightmares.

                            PAUL
                  Jesus, they had some bad dreams and
                  now they're not gonna show up for
                  class? I mean, we can't just accept
                  that?

                            BRETT
                  I don't know what to do here.
                  Obviously, I have to take the
                  students' concerns seriously, too.

                                PAUL
                      Yes, of course, but... Isn't this a
                      bit of an overreaction? They're
                      dreams, it's not real. I'm not
                      actually doing anything to them.

                                BRETT
                      As I said, this is really new
                      territory. I think I just need to
                      consult with HR.

                                PAUL
                      Do you, Brett, as my friend, and
                      not speaking as the dean of Osler,
                      think that we should pause the
                      semester because some students are
                      having bad dreams?

                                BRETT
                      Well, I haven't had one of these
                      dreams so I can't really speak to
                      the--

                                PAUL
                      No, no, no, don't say "lived
                      experience."

                                BRETT
                      But it sounds like they've actually
                      been traumatized.

                                PAUL
                      Trauma is a trend these days, it's
                      a joke! Everything is trauma.
                      Arguing with a friend is trauma.
                      Getting bad grades is trauma. They
                      need to grow up!

        Paul and Janet are finally doing that dinner with Richard who
        is now reluctantly greeting them in the hallway.

                                JANET
                      Hi, Richard.

                      Hi!

                                PAUL
                      Richard! Carlota! It's been too
                      long!

        They hug. Paul notices the empty hallway and no sounds coming
        from the house.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Are we the first ones?

                                RICHARD
                      Oh, actually it'll just be us.

                                PAUL
                      Really? I thought this was gonna be
                      one of your famous "bring people
                      together" things.

        Carlota and Richard seem a bit uneasy.

                                RICHARD
                      Yeah, we... Uh... We thought it
                      would be nice with just us four.

                                PAUL
                      OK... Yeah... More wine for us!

        Paul pretends to drink straight from the bottle he brought,
        as a joke.


 65     INT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER                 65

        That bottle is now opened on the table. Richard pours
        everyone a glass. There's tension in the air. Paul raises his
        glass.

                                PAUL
                      Cheers guys.

        Richard and Carlota cheer him back with low enthusiasm.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                          (to Carlota)
                      So, Carlota, I heard you're at a
                      new practice now?

                                CARLOTA
                      Yeah, I am.

                                PAUL

                      Yes.

        Awkward silence.

                                JANET
                      This is so good by the way.

                                PAUL
                      Oh my gosh, these Brussels sprouts
                      are amazing.

                                RICHARD
                      Yeah, got them from... Shelly's.

                                PAUL
                      Ah!

        New awkward silence.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      So I'm starting to think maybe Nick
                      Bostrom was right about the
                      simulation theory. That would sure
                      explain a lot about, you know, my
                      whole situation.

        Richard looks over at Carlota, who doesn't seem engaged.

                                RICHARD
                      Oh yeah, remember Nick, Carlota?
                      Swedish guy, philosopher at Oxford.

                                PAUL
                      He was here?

                                RICHARD
                      Yeah, once or twice.

                                PAUL
                      Invite us both next time... He'd
                      probably love to speak with me...


                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Wasn't I the one who even told you
                      about him?

                                RICHARD NO,
                      I don't think so...

        Janet sees that Carlota has zoned out.

                  pottery?

        Carlota chokes on her food and coughs. Richard pats her back.

                            CARLOTA
                  Please! Don't be so rough!

                            RICHARD
                  Sorry... You OK?

                            CARLOTA
                  You're slamming my back!

        Paul and Janet are baffled by the awkwardness.

                            PAUL
                  Everything good?

        Carlota doesn't answer.

                            RICHARD
                  She's had a rough day at work,
                  so...

                            PAUL
                  Ah. Ok.

        More silence.

        Carlota's lower lip is starting to shiver.

        We see a FLASH CUT of Carlota's nightmare. Paul is strangling
        Carlota from behind with a metal wire normally used for
        pottery, in her pottery studio.

                            JANET
                  Oh no, what's the matter?

                            CARLOTA
                  Sorry, I can't do this... I can't.

        Carlota storms out. Richard runs after Carlota. We can hear
        them discuss loudly.

                            PAUL
                      (to Janet)

        Richard comes back down. He seems distressed.

                  this up. Carlota isn't feeling
                  well.

                  brutal nightmares lately.

        Paul is caught between two states: trying to show sympathy,
        but also being fed up with this phenomenon.

                  I convinced her not to cancel, I
                  shouldn't have done that.

                  Should the three of us still finish

                  --No you have to leave.

                             PAUL

 66     INT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY            66

        In what looks like an emergency crisis consultation, all of
        Paul's students have gathered, sitting on chairs on the
        basketball court while CANDICE, a woman from HR addresses
        them.

                                CANDICE
                      The basic idea with Cognitive
                      Behavioral Therapy is that we'll go
                      through gradual exposure to what we
                      feel is threatening us, to
                      familiarize with it instead of
                      fearing it. What doesn't kill us
                      makes us stronger, right?

        The students look at each other.

                                CANDICE (CONT'D)
                      I know that a lot of you have had
                      upsetting dreams about your
                      professor. The dreams suggest that
                      Paul Matthews is a harmful person,
                      and your mind is trying to keep you
                      safe by creating certain emotional
                      triggers, motivating you to avoid
                      him. I want to defuse those
                      triggers by showing you that Paul
                      is in fact a kind, loving and
                      harmless human being.

        She holds up a photo of Paul smiling to everyone. One of the
        students is visibly upset by this. Candice then puts the
        photo down.

                                CANDICE (CONT'D)
                      OK. So, I'm going to invite Paul in
                      to the room. He's going to step
                      inside that door aaaaall the way
                      over there. And he's going to stay
                      at that safe distance until
                      everyone feels it's comfortable to
                      invite him closer. All right? If
                      anyone feels unsafe you may calmly
                      state "Candice, I don't feel safe
                      at this moment." Does everybody
                      understand that?

        The students nod and say yes.

                                CANDICE (CONT'D)
                      All right. Paul?!

        After a few anticipating beats, Paul opens the door at the
        far end of the court and takes two steps in. Everyone stares
        at him, there's a few awkward beats before Candice
        interjects:

                            CANDICE (CONT'D)
                  Ok, that wasn't so bad, was it?
                  Let's have him step forward, get a
                  little bit closer. Paul?

        Paul takes a few slow steps closer. The students start
        feeling uneasy.

                            CANDICE (CONT'D)
                  Paul is not going to hurt you. Can
                  we let him get even a bit closer..?

        Nobody responds.

                            CANDICE (CONT'D)
                  Paul, step closer please.

        Paul takes a few more steps,   inching closer, then stops. He's
        now at a half-court distance   from the students. Tension is
        building. Candice waves Paul   closer, and he takes another few
        steps. Tension is at a peak,   everyone is frozen in
        anticipation.

                            PAUL
                  So...

        A student starts running towards the doors, which triggers
        the rest of the students to follow, as though they just
        realized Paul is holding a gun. Candice yells at them to
        stop, Paul is just standing there, disappointed.


 67     EXT. OSLER UNIVERSITY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                  67

        Paul is on foot through the campus, walking to the parking
        lot. All the students in the campus area are scowling at him,
        following him with judgmental looks as though he's an outlaw
        being banished from the town. We can tell Paul feels a bit
        nervous, like as if the whole crowd could suddenly turn
        violent. When he finally reaches his car he sees someone has
        graffitied "LOSER" on it. He turns around and looks at all
        the students who are watching him from a distance.

                            PAUL
                  Hey! HEY! Who did this? Tell me
                  now! Stop being little fucking
                  brats! Who the fuck did this?

        This aggressive behavior seems to confirm their belief that
        Paul is evil, and some seem upset and frightened. One of the
        students is recording Paul on his phone.

 68     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT          68

        The family is having dinner.

                            JANET
                  So what did Brett say?

                            PAUL
                  "See it as a little vacation" - can
                  you believe it? I'm a tenured
                  professor and they're basically
                  letting the students run the
                  school.

                            JANET
                  So how long are you not gonna be
                  working?

                            PAUL
                  I don't even know if I want to go
                  back at this point, you know? I
                  should just go all-in with the
                  book.

                            HANNAH
                  What did you do? Like, why did
                  everything change?

                            PAUL
                  I didn't do anything, Hannah.

                            HANNAH
                  You must have done something.

                            PAUL
                  Well, I didn't... So...

                            HANNAH
                  Have you seen twitter?

                            PAUL
                  No?

                            HANNAH
                  There's like thousands of people
                  sharing nightmares, about like
                  torture and rape and--

        There's an awkward silence.

                                JANET
                      Are you gonna clean that stuff off

        Janet is having a private meeting with Chris in a glass
        cubicle at the office.

                                JANET
                      They're kicking me off the project?

                                CHRIS
                      It seems like they just want to be
                      extra careful moving into the final
                      stages, just as a precautionary
                      measure.

                                JANET
                      Because of Paul?

                                CHRIS
                      You know, I'm really against, like,
                      cancel culture and everything but I
                      think it would be better if you
                      kept a lower profile until the
                      whole scandal dies down... Does
                      that make sense?

                      They call you Freddy Krueger... At

                      Yeah... They're just trying to
                      tease you.

                                SOPHIE
                      Julian said you tied him up and cut
                      off his toes and ate them.

                                PAUL
                      You think I would cut someone's
                      toes off?

                      Dreaming is like a psychosis,
                      Sophie, our brain decides to start
                      hallucinating at night, which is
                      part of its housekeeping process,
                      we need that to happen, for some
                      reason.

                                SOPHIE
                      But why are you so mean in the
                      dreams?

                                PAUL
                      It's their dreams, I have nothing
                      to do with it. You understand that,
                      right?

                                   SOPHIE
                      I guess...

        video of him screaming at his students, without showing the
        context of the vandalized car. Paul is shocked and gets out

                            MARY
                  What?

                            PAUL
                  Obama. You guys were talking to
                  him, right?

                            MARY
                  Oh, I mean, Obama's not an option
                  anymore.

                            TRENT
                  Yeah, Paul, we're talking about a
                  complete 180, we have to think
                  fresh. Corporate culture won't
                  touch this. It's too risky.

        Paul notices two students, Robbie and Miles, who are
        loitering outside the house, immediately making him anxious.

                            MARY
                  But we are getting positive signals
                  from a different venue, the whole
                  kind of.. I don't want to say
                  "altright" but the kind of
                  antiestablishment space, you know?
                  Kind of the Jordan Peterson route?

                            TRENT
                  Yeah we could maybe get you on
                  Rogan or something, share your
                  experience getting cancelled and
                  just, like, pivot the convo to your
                  plant book..

                            PAUL
                  Guys.. No. I hate that idea.

                            MARY
                  Just so we can understand you
                  better, what exactly are you
                  opposed to?

                            PAUL
                  I don't want to be some "culture
                  war person"! I don't want to be
                  "controversial".

                  Ok. Ok. This is gonna go right
                  against what you're saying right
                  now, but... There's like maybe a
                  chance to go on Tucker Carlson this
                  week though...that's a big
                  audience. Just think about that,
                  don't answer now, just think about
                  it.

                            MARY
                  Yeah, and then there's France. For
                  some reason they love you over
                  there, even with the nightmares!
                  They love it!

        Paul walks over to his window to get a better look at the
        students who are now on his property.

                            TRENT
                  Yeah, we're building a fanbase over
                  there.

                            PAUL
                  Isn't there some type of charity I
                  can do, maybe?

                            MARY
                  No, that's sweet, but no.

                            TRENT
                  It might seem apologetic.

        Paul, wearing casual attire and a baseball cap for anonymity,
        enjoys a meal while reading a Robert Sapolsky book at a local
        diner. GRACE, the waitress then approaches him.

                            GRACE
                  Hi.

                            PAUL
                  It's good! Thanks.

        Paul smiles then gets back to his reading, but Grace is still
        hovering.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
                  What?

                                GRACE
                      I'm so sorry sir, I hate to do
                      this, but there are some people who
                      aren't really comfortable with the
                      fact that you're here.

                                PAUL
                      Ok?

                                GRACE
                      Yeah..

                                PAUL
                      Well, if they're so uncomfortable
                      maybe they should leave?

                                GRACE
                      Uhm, sure yeah, but--

                                PAUL
                      I'm just enjoying my meal. I
                      haven't said or done anything.

                                GRACE
                      Right... I mean, I guess I could
                      tell them you're about to leave?

                                PAUL
                      Why should I leave, I haven't
                      broken any of your rules have I?

                                GRACE
                      Uhm... I mean, no, but...

                                PAUL
                      Great, then that's that, right?

                                GRACE
                      Uhm, yeah, I guess... Ok.

        Paul gets back to his book and continues to eat. Grace leaves
        to talk to the two people who were complaining. After some
        moments another patron of the diner, a LARGE MAN, walks over
        to Paul.

                                LARGE MAN
                      Hey. Hi. Would you do us a favor
                      and wrap that up? Nobody wants you
                      here, man. It'd be great if you
                      could just leave.

                                PAUL
                      Well, I'm staying.

                  and leave when I'm done... Ok?

                            LARGE MAN
                  Ok.

        The large man takes his plate and spits on his food and puts
        it back. Paul is shocked. The large man walks back to his
        table, while Paul picks up his food and throws it at the guy.


 78     INT./EXT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER - DAY                         78

        Janet is driving with a badly bruised Paul, plastered in
        medical strips and gauze to cover cuts around his eye,
        sitting in the passenger seat.

                            JANET
                  Listen... Maybe you need to be more
                  pro-active about this.

                            PAUL
                  What do you mean?

                             JANET
                  Make a public statement or
                  something... Maybe you should
                  apologize.

                            PAUL
                  I should apologize? Look at my face
                  for Christ's sake.

                            JANET
                  Just to get people off your back!
                  Off our back.

                            PAUL
                  No, that's ridiculous. I'm not
                  gonna do that.

                            JANET
                  You're not alone in this, I almost
                  lost my job!

                            PAUL
                  Which is completely uncalled for.

 79     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                      79

        Paul is preparing the couch in the living room for a night of
        sleep. Janet switches all the lights off as she's going
        upstairs.

        Janet puts the lights back on and continues upstairs.

 81     EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN (DREAM)                    81

        Paul is out jogging in the early morning mist. The streets
        are completely empty, no one is out yet. Suddenly out of
        nowhere an arrow hits him in the arm and gets stuck. Paul,
        shocked and perplex tries to understand what has just
        happened, and sees that a mysterious man in the woods next to
        the road is approaching him with a crossbow in hand. Paul
        starts running as he's also trying to prod the arrow out of
        his arm. As he's running another arrow hits him in the back.
        This one stings and slows him down, he can see that the
        mystery man is catching up with him.

        Paul then takes a turn and tries to shake him off. Another
        arrow hits him in the leg, and he stumbles. He quickly hides
        behind a tree. Paul is desperate and in pain. It's quiet. The
        mystery man nowhere to be seen. He stays still for a while,
        then starts looking around to see if he's safe to move again.

        Then suddenly the mystery man appears in front of him, and we
        can now see that the person who has been chasing him is in
        fact another Paul. The nightmare version of Paul, who now
        aims the crossbow at his face. The real Paul is extremely
        uncomfortable having an arrow pointed at his face, which the
        nightmare Paul seems to enjoy as he waits to pull the
        trigger. Then suddenly he fires one off that goes straight
        into Paul's neck, hitting the artery and making him bleed
        heavily.

        Paul, still with a visibly bruised face, sits next to Janet
        in the office of Sophie's teacher KAYLA, who's standing in
        front of her desk. There's a mirror on the wall, and Paul
        catches a glimpse of himself and is reminded of his own
        nightmare.

                                KAYLA
                      It seems like there's a consensus
                      between the parents, and if it's
                      not too much to ask, we'd like you
                      to sit this one out.

                                PAUL
                      But it is, it is too much to ask.
                      This is ridiculous. This is a huge
                      moment for her, of course I'm going
                      to be there!

                                JANET
                      Paul, please...

                                PAUL
                      What? They're imposing an exile!
                      I'm supposed to just accept that?

                                JANET
                      Don't be so dramatic.

                                KAYLA
                      We'll have someone record it, OK?
                      You'll get to see it, just not in
                      the room on the night.

                      What I'm saying is that I don't
                      need your opinions on pedagogy.

                                KAYLA
                      I understand that you want to be
                      there, but at this point the
                      majority of the parents don't.
                      They're worried their kids will
                      feel unsafe, and obviously this
                      isn't totally unwarranted.

        Kayla is gesturing towards Paul's bruised face.

                    JANET                               PAUL
        Paul, why don't we make this       Why don't you take my side--
        easier on everyone and just--      Janet?

                                JANET (CONT'D)
                      Sophie shouldn't suffer just
                      because you want to make a point.
                      Don't make us all die on your hill!

        An ASSISTANT knocks on the door and pops her head in.

                                ASSISTANT
                          (to Paul)
                      Hi, sorry to bother you. Do you own
                      the car that says "Loser"?

        Paul is suddenly embarrassed.

                                PAUL
                      Yes...


 84     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - NEXT DAY - DAY             84

        Paul is seated by his computer, preparing to make a video
        recording of himself. He spends time trying to make himself
        look emotionally worked up. When he's almost brought himself
        to tears he starts recording.

 84      CONTINUED:                                                 84

                                 PAUL
                      Where do I begin?
                          (beat)
                      Let's start with this: I'm sorry.
                      I'm sorry I didn't address this
                      earlier, I'm sorry to anyone who's
                      had one of those terrible, terrible
                      nightmares. The reason I'm so
                      emotionally distressed right now is
                      because I've just had one myself.
                      I've experienced what so many of
                      you must have experienced: being
                      violently attacked and abused by a
                      man that looks like me. I have to
                      stress: that man is not me. And I
                      speak now from actual lived
                      experience. I'm one of you.

        Paul starts tearing up.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I've been vilified in my life,
                      haunted in my dreams. My mere
                      presence upsets people... And not
                      because of what I've actually done,
                      but because of what people imagine
                      I've done. Should I really be
                      punished for that? Aren't I the
                      biggest victim of this whole
                      phenomenon? Just look at how it's
                      affecting my life!

        Paul forces himself to cry. It's very operatic.


 85     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - SOPHIE'S BEDROOM - LATER - DAY          85

        We hear a muffled argument between Paul and Janet in the
        distance. Hannah and Sophie are both on their phones,
        watching the apology video.

                                HANNAH
                      I'm actually gonna kill myself.

                                SOPHIE
                      What is he doing?


 86     EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK PATIO - DAY                        86

        Paul and Janet are having a heated argument.

                                JANET
                      It was completely insincere and
                      self-serving.

                                PAUL
                      What? Which part?

                                 JANET
                      It's embarrassing Paul! It's
                      embarrassing to be married to you
                      right now.

        That comment hits Paul hard.


 87     EXT. BRETT'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER - NIGHT               87

        Brett greets Paul in his driveway as Paul pulls out a gym bag
        full of clothes out of his car.


                                PAUL
                      Thanks for letting me stay...

                                 BRETT
                      Yeah... Just a little heads up, my
                      wife wasn't too hot on the idea, so
                      I think it'll be downstairs, if
                      that's OK?


 88     INT. BRETT'S HOUSE -- BASEMENT - LATER                      88

        Brett is now showing Paul the guest room in his basement,
        which besides the bed and a ping pong table is completely
        empty. You can hear the buzz from the light fixtures.

                                PAUL
                      What's the smell?

                                BRETT
                      I think that's the propane tank...
                      I'll crack a window.

        Brett shows Paul his depressing bed for the night.

                                PAUL
                      I can't just sleep on the couch
                      upstairs?

                                 BRETT
                      I'm sorry man. Uhm... If you need
                      anything, just text me? And I'll
                      come down?

 89     INT. BRETT'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT                        89

        Paul can't seem to fall asleep. He's bothered by one of the
        light fixtures which is still on in the hallway. He walks
        over in his underwear to kill it, but the nearest switch on
        the wall doesn't seem to do anything. He finds another
        switch, switches it, but yet again nothing happens. He keeps
        walking around the basement looking for the right switch, and
        he keeps getting more frustrated each time because none of
        them work. Defeated, he goes back to the bed and tries to
        sleep. The buzzing from the light seems to grow and grow in
        volume.


 90     EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DUSK                                 90
        Paul is in incognito mode, wearing unassuming clothes and a
        baseball hat, waiting outside the school as parents enter to
        see the play.


 91     INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - FOYER/HALLWAY/AUDITORIUM - NIGHT        91

        The foyer is almost empty, just a few staff members who are
        quietly talking. They give Paul a glance, but don't seem to
        recognize him. He continues through the corridors leading to
        the auditorium. PORTIA, a junior staff member notices Paul
        and tries to stop him.

                            PORTIA
                  Hey... Excuse me? Sir?

                            PAUL
                  I'm seeing my daughter, she's on
                  stage.

                            PORTIA
                  You're Mr. Matthews, right?

                            PAUL
                  No.

                            PORTIA
                  You're not Paul Matthews?

                            PAUL
                  No.

        The young staffer knows he's lying, but is left powerless.
        Paul keeps walking and the staffer starts jogging back
        towards the foyer for help.

                            PORTIA
                  Call security.

        Paul reaches the auditorium, but the doors are locked. He can
        hear music coming from inside and starts gently knocking.
        Kayla, Sophie's teacher, opens the door and is immediately
        shocked.

                                KAYLA
                          (whispers)
                      You can't be here Paul.

                                PAUL
                      Let me just watch, I'll leave
                      before it's over.

                                KAYLA
                      No, I thought we had an agreement.

                                PAUL
                      Come on, I just wanna watch for a
                      few minutes.

                                KAYLA
                      Please, Paul, respect our
                      boundaries.

                                PAUL
                      This is ridiculous, let me in!

        Kayla is trying to push the door shut, which Paul is
        blocking, but he suddenly moves away from the door as he sees
        the young staffer now accompanied with a security guard deep
        in the corridor. The door slams, then slowly creeks back open
        as Kayla screams in pain from her fingers being jammed.
        Several fingers are clearly broken and she's bleeding onto
        the floor. Paul walks through the doorway to check on Kayla,
        who keeps screaming and starts running down the aisle holding
        on to her mangled hand, fingers broken so severely they are
        bent impossibly out of shape.

                                KAYLA
                      He attacked me! Paul Matthews
                      attacked me!

        The lights turn on, the play stops. Paul stands there,
        perplexed. Paul sees Sophie on stage, and Sophie stares right
        back at him. He tries to plead with the shocked parents.

                                PAUL
                      It was an accident! She wouldn't
                      let me in! I just want to see my
                      daughter! She wouldn't let me, it
                      was an accident!

        Paul sees Janet seated next to an incredibly embarrassed
        Hannah, and to our surprise Chris is there too.

        Janet can't believe what she's witnessing. Suddenly, the
        security guard enters and Paul impulsively tries to run away.

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  Hey! Stop!

        Then a bunch of the other parents jump up from their seat and
        tackle Paul to the ground.

                            PAUL
                  No, it was an accident, an
                  accident! Sophie, it was an
                  accident! Get off me!

        Sophie starts crying, Hannah and Janet are in shock as Chris
        tries to comfort Janet.

 92     INT./EXT. TV SEGMENT FROM ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT - DAY        92

        With a documentary style camera, we are introduced to a big
        mansion in the Hollywood Hills where about ten influencers
        live and work together. They are interviewed on camera,
        intercut with observational footage of them working,
        laughing, and living. Everyone is wearing the same piece of
        high tech jewelry on their wrists (The "Norio") and dressed
        in coordinated outfits.

                  I think social media is over. I
                  truly do. If you can, like, promote
                  a song or like a product like
                  actually in someone's head? That's
                  way more powerful, you know?

                            HUNTER
                  It's really hard to do! I don't
                  think people understand that. They
                  think you can just, like, get a
                  Norio and like, that's it... Like...

                  thing in advertising is happening.

        A shot shows seven of the dreamfluencers lying on their backs
        on the floor, with their eyes closed as though meditating,
        with the Norio on their wrists, then:

                      From mysterious phenomena to
                      internet controversy, the case of
                      Paul Matthews completely changed

                      Consciousness is more complex than
                      we thought. Dualism was right, Jung
                      was right. There is a collective
                      unconscious, Paul Matthews proved
                      that, even if accidentally. The
                      Norio would definitely not exist
                      without him.

                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                      Brian Berg is the inventor of the
                      Norio, a wearable device that
                      activates the brain during deep
                      sleep and promotes what is called
                      "lucid dream travel", which enables
                      users to appear in others dreams.
                      The device also has a sleep
                      incubation mode, which lets you
                      decide what to dream about.

                  You can either buy one for about
                  five thousand dollars, or get the
                  ad supported version for free - if
                  you don't mind commercials.. In
                  your dreams.

                            BRIAN
                  Norio takes consciousness to a new
                  level. It interacts directly with
                  the sleeping brain and manipulates
                  the dreams as they are happening.
                  What's puzzling about Paul Matthews
                  is that he tapped into this on a
                  massive scale without even trying,
                  which is really hard to do even
                  with the Norio.

        Four dreamfluencers sit next to each other and discuss Paul
        Matthews:

                            HUNTER
                  They always bring up Paul Matthews
                  as, like, the cautionary tale.

                            HALEY
                  Yeah.. on one end it's like, this
                  industry probably wouldn't exist
                  without him, but then he also put
                  such a negative stamp on it.

                            AMBER
                  It's kind of crazy that he unlocked
                  this power just to, like, terrorize
                  people.

                            DYLAN
                  Yeah, why choose that when it's so
                  easy to spread positivity?

                            CARTER
                  When I first got the Norio I was
                  practicing on my mom, like, I would
                  try to enter her dreams every
                  night, just to, like, get good at
                  it. But she kept saying I was
                  taking the form of a table, like, I
                  was a talking table in her dreams.
                  It took me months just to figure
                  out how to control my appearance.

                            DYLAN
                  The mind is trippy, loose,
                  flexible, and abstract.

 93     INT. PAUL'S NEW APARTMENT - MONTHS LATER - DAY               93

        Paul, Hannah and Sophie are inside of an empty and
        uninspiring three-bedroom apartment. Paul looks different,
        many months must have passed. A REALTOR is showing them
        around.

                            PAUL
                  Ah... Nice, OK. Girls, wanna look
                  at the bedrooms? See which ones you
                  like?

                            HANNAH
                  I don't like it.

                            PAUL
                  Go look at the bedrooms. Please.

        The girls go to scope the bedrooms. The realtor and Paul stay
        in the living room.

                            REALTOR
                  Uhm... My friend... Used to have
                  those dreams... So she claimed at
                  least.

                            PAUL
                  Oh... Huh... Yeah.

        The realtor makes an awkward knife stab motion as a joke.

                            REALTOR
                  So what happened? It just stopped,
                  or? Feel like I haven't heard about
                  that in a while.

                            PAUL
                  Yeah, I don't know, people stopped
                  having them I guess. If I hear
                  anything now it's mostly abroad.

        Sophie pops her head in.

                            SOPHIE
                  What's the smell?

                      Oh... I was told that the owners
                      were big animal lovers. It'll air
                      out in time I'm sure.


 94     INT./EXT. PAUL'S CAR - EVENING                              94

        Paul has parked the car outside his old house. Before Sophie
        and Hannah get the chance to get out, Paul interjects:

                                PAUL
                      Hey, before you leave... Have you
                      seen that guy Chris around the
                      house lately?

                                SOPHIE
                      Uhm... Yeah?

                                HANNAH
                      Yeah, like a week ago?

                                PAUL
                      Is he here often?

                                SOPHIE
                      ... I mean, Not really?

                                PAUL
                      Does he stay over?

                                SOPHIE
                      I don't think so?

        Hannah is concentrated on her phone.

                                PAUL
                      Hannah, does he stay over?

                                HANNAH
                      I don't know!

        Janet comes out of the house. Sophie and Hannah both take
        their bags and run inside.

                                  SOPHIE

                                   JANET
                      Good.

                      I don't think Sophie really liked
                      it... She kept asking why I don't
                      just move back in... with us...

                                JANET
                      Yeah... And cost-wise? Good?

                                PAUL
                      Yeah, you know, between the
                      settlement from Osler and the book
                      deal I should be fine. More than
                      fine actually.

                                   JANET
                      Ok, great.

        There's a hint of a smile lurking in Janet's expression.

                                PAUL
                      Yeah... Have you seen me in your
                      dreams lately by the way?

                                JANET
                      No? Why do you keep asking?

                                PAUL
                      Just curious...
                          (Paul checks his watch)
                      Shit, I'm late.

        whispers something in his ear. He looks back at her and she

        Cut back to reality.

 96     INT. PAUL'S NEW APARTMENT - NIGHT (DREAM)                 96

        - Paul is getting to bed in his new apartment. He has almost
        no furniture there. He folds his clothes on a little chair he
        has set up next to the bed.

        - He then walks to the kitchen to get a glass of water. The
        dead animals are still there but he just steps over them,
        barefoot.

        - When he returns to his bedroom, there's a teenage boy
        there, one of the dream influencers. He's wearing very
        youthful trendy clothes.

                            DREAM INFLUENCER#3
                  Hey Paul. I love those on you.

        Paul looks down, and he is suddenly wearing very flashy
        sneakers. The boy starts dancing in a trendy Tik-Tok style.

                            DREAM INFLUENCER#3 (CONT'D)
                  Come on, try them out, dance with
                  me.

        Paul is suddenly enraged and tries to punch the guy in the
        face, but his punches are weak and slow, typical of dreams,
        not really harming the guy.

        Paul wakes up from the dream, a bit confused, in a hotel room
        in Paris. The keen observer will notice him wearing a Norio
        device on his wrist.


 98     EXT. PARIS - STREET - DAY                                      98

        Paul and Trent are walking through busy streets of Paris.

                                TRENT
                      First up is a magazine called Rue
                      Morgue. They write about myths,
                      cults, horror movies, stuff like
                      that.

                                PAUL
                      Did you bring a copy of the book?

                                TRENT
                      No, it's going straight to the
                      store, we'll see it there.


 99     INT. PARIS - MANOR HOUSE - DAY                                 99

        Paul is being photographed for a French magazine in a stylish
        old manor house. There's a crew of about five people there,
        makeup, wardrobe, and some assistants. Trent is also present,
        watching from the sideline. CLAUDE, the thirty-something
        photographer is instructing Paul.

        The assistant picks up a movie prop, the knife glove from
        Nightmare on Elm Street, and gives it to Paul, who
        immediately hesitates.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                CLAUDE
                      Can you put it on Paul?

                                PAUL
                      Uh, I'd rather not.


                                CLAUDE
                      What? Don't be silly Paul. It's
                      cool.

                                PAUL
                      No, I just... I don't want to.

                                CLAUDE
                      What? The glove is cool, I think
                      you should wear it.

                                PAUL
                      Can I say no?

                                CLAUDE
                      Come on, it makes sense, you're
                      nightmare guy, it's totally cool.

        Paul looks at Trent, Trent nods approvingly, and Paul caves
        and puts the glove on.

                                CLAUDE (CONT'D)
                      See, not so bad? Looks good.

        Claude snaps some photos.

                                CLAUDE (CONT'D)
                      Could you stand behind the chair
                      Paul? And sneak up like a little
                      monster.

        Paul does what he's told.

 101    EXT. PARIS - STREET - DAY                                101

        Paul and Trent are walking through busy sidewalks in Paris,
        again.

                                TRENT
                      No, it's still the store, but a
                      different room or something? Maybe
                      they need a bigger space?

 102    INT. PARIS - BOOKSTORE - DAY                                102

        Paul and Trent are greeted by JEAN, the manager of the
        bookstore, who speaks English with a heavy French accent.

                            JEAN
                  Paul! Hi how are you? I'm Jean.

                               PAUL
                  Hi. Paul.

        Jean goes for the French kiss hello, Paul awkwardly follows
        suit.

                            TRENT
                  Yes... Bonjour.

        As Trent and Jean kiss hello, Paul notices that there's
        already a sizable turnout.

                            PAUL
                  Wow, big turnout.

                            JEAN
                  Oh that's for the other event. I'm
                  so sorry, there was a conflict...
                  They had to move you downstairs.


 103    INT. PARIS - BOOKSTORE - STAIRWELL/BASEMENT - MOMENTS       103
        LATER DAY

        They walk downstairs to a smaller basement of the store. It's
        drab and uninspiring. They have a plastic table and a chair
        set up in the corner, with a huge stack of books with an
        image of Paul and the title "Je suis ton cauchemar."

                            JEAN
                  Voila! So, this is it.

                            PAUL
                  Is that the book? I haven't
                  actually seen the physical copy
                  yet.

        Paul walks over to the table and picks up a copy. It's really
        thin, probably less than 100 pages.

                               PAUL (CONT'D)
                  Huh... OK.

                            TRENT
                  Wow, it's so thin...

                                PAUL
                      I guess it got shorter in
                      translation? "Je suis ton...." They
                      changed the title too?

                                 JEAN
                      "I am your nightmare"? That's not
                      the title?

                                PAUL
                      Oh... It was supposed to be "Dream
                      Scenario." This is fine, I guess.
                      Yeah... It's fine. Probably works
                      better for the... Demographic.

        He forces a smile to Jean and Trent.


 104    INT. PARIS - BOOKSTORE - BASEMENT - LATER - DAY          104

        A line has formed leading up to the table, eagerly awaiting
        Paul to sign their copy of the book. It's not a big turnout,
        even for the smaller location, but Paul seems bemused just by
        the fact that he has fans here. FONTANE (38) a heavy set man
        wearing a Rosemary's Baby t-shirt hands him his copy.

                                PAUL
                      Who do I make this out to?

        We can hear footsteps from the large crowd upstairs, the
        other event is so packed that dust from the ceiling lands on
        the table in front of Paul. As he looks up, the light fixture
        hanging from a chain falls off and lands on his forehead,
        causing a cut.

                                PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Fuck!

        Trent rushes over.

                                TRENT
                      Shit, are you all right?

        Paul feels his forehead and then sees blood on his hand.
        Someone hands him a napkin which he presses against his head.
        Trent is looking for the manager for assistance.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Jean? Fuck where did he go?

 111    INT. PARIS - HOTEL - PAUL'S ROOM - LATER - NIGHT             111

        Paul is looking at a video called "No Bullshit Guide To Dream
        Travel" on his laptop as he puts his Norio on his wrist.

                                                           CUT TO:

        Paul is now lying down   on the floor, on his back, eyes closed
        and really focused. He   slowly raises his arms up in the air
        as though reaching for   something, as we hear the video guide
        him. The camera pushes   in slowly towards his face.


 112    EXT. BIG EMPTY GRASSY FIELD - DAWN (DREAM)                   112

        It's a foggy morning, we're in a big open field. There's a
        big stone fountain in the middle of it, and Janet is tied up
        to it. Instead of water, there's flames at the base of it.
        It's like she's a witch burned at the stake. She's helplessly
        struggling to get out without much success. All of Janet's
        movements are a little bit slow, and sounds are more
        pronounced than normal. She notices someone coming towards
        her. It's Paul. He is wearing that oversized Talking Heads
        suit they discussed, indicating that we must be inside of her
        dream, and that Paul has managed to get inside of it. Janet
        smiles. He reaches for her, grabs her hand over the flames.


 113    EXT. EMPTY SUBURBAN STREETS - SUNRISE (DREAM)                113

        The two of them walk through a beautiful slightly foggy
        suburban street with sunbeams shooting through the haze. Paul
        is still wearing his Talking Heads suit as they walk side-by-
        side holding hands. The birds are chirping. Paul does some
        silly Talking Heads moves with his suit. Janet laughs. Then
        he initiates a slow dance, and Janet follows.

                            PAUL
                  I wish this was real.

                                                            (CONTINUED)

        They look at each other for a bit. Both their eyes are
        getting teary. Paul then suddenly starts to levitate off the
        ground, away from Janet.
