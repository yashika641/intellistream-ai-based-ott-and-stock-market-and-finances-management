    Male and female voices over black.

                          BRIAN (V.O.)
                I remember, like yourself Sylvia, I
                too came in. I was broken, I was
                lost, and I was hopeless. With no
                direction of where I was going to
                go in my life.

    JORGE (28, El Salvadorian) speaks with a pronounced accent.

                          JORGE
                I remember I passed you. You were
                riding your bicycle up a hill and
                90 days sober. I remember thinking:
                We all got our struggles, but we
                don't need to get loaded over it.

    LORRAINE (32) speaks, crying a bit.

                          LORRAINE
                I'm here. I made it. I got here.
                And I didn't even know what was
                gonna be going on. But I'm happy to
                see Anna. You're what I wish I
                could have been. I wish my mom...
                would have been as strong as you,
                Sylvia.

2   INT. CHURCH HALL (SUNSET PARK) NIGHT                          2
    The surroundings blur as the camera focuses on KAREN.

                          KAREN
                My dear Sylvia. Being your sponsor
                has been a gift. I know you don't
                like to hear this, but I really do
                think you should find yourself a
                person. So you don't end up alone
                like me.

    Karen immediately regrets oversharing. She starts again.

                          KAREN (cont'd)
                I love you as if you were my own
                daughter. Maybe because you're like
                a child in many ways. I want to
                take care of you. That's why I
                don't want you to be alone. Anna
                will grow up. She'll go away, to
                make it on her own.
                          (MORE)

                                                            2.

                      KAREN (cont'd)
            We've known each other for thirteen
            years. That's longer than most
            marriages nowadays.
Laughter and applause. Karen stares lovingly back at Sylvia.
John basks in the ensuing applause.
Close on EMILY, trembling - her pupils are dilated.
                      EMILY
            I'm not going to say as much. I've
            only known you for four days... but
            I can tell how much everyone loves
            you. I hope I can get to where you
            are...
She bursts into tears.
Close on SYLVIA - slender, fragile looking, sweet smile,
baggy clothes - not someone who prioritizes her appearance.
Sylvia, celebrating 13 years of sobriety, responds.
                      SYLVIA
            I'm very grateful for this space
            and for all of you and definitely
            nothing would be possible without
            you. And I'm very grateful for my
            daughter.
ANNA (13) Sylvia's daughter, a fresh and confident version
of her mother, aware of every detail, smiles - this is her
first time attending an AA event.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            How do you feel here?
Anna hugs her.
                        ANNA
            Good.
Sylvia fights back the tears. Everyone's eyes are on her.
                      SYLVIA
            Is it what you thought?
                      ANNA
            Yes! I'm so proud of you.
Some members cry while others raise their phones to take
pictures of the moment.
     
                                                                 3.


2A   INT. CHURCH HALL (SUNSET PARK) NIGHT                             2A
     The members are picking up the chairs and getting ready to
     leave. Sylvia is saying goodbye to the people.
                           KAREN
                 I'm glad you came, Anna.
                           AA MEMBER
                 Congratulations Sylvia! Good night.
                           KAREN
                 Let's have dinner later.

3    EXT. SYLVIA'S NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT                                3
     Sylvia and Anna arrive to their house in an Uber. They go
     inside. The neighborhood is not so fancy.

     INT. SYLVIA' S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. MORNING
4                                                                     4
     Sylvia prepares two portions of freshly made dumplings. She
     places them in plastic containers - they look professionally
     made. Her movements are quick, precise, elegant.
     Peeling paint and damp spots scar the walls of the old
     house. Anna takes an apple out of the fridge.
                           ANNA
                 The fridge broke again?

                           SYLVIA
                 I called to have it fixed.

                           ANNA
                 It's seven thirty.

     Anna eats the apple on the go - she's in a hurry.

A5   EXT. STREET / SCHOOL (SUNSET PARK). DAY                          A5
     Sylvia and Anna rush to school through a grim-looking
     neighborhood.

5    EXT. STREET / SCHOOL (SUNSET PARK). DAY                          5
     The school bell rings. Anna speeds up, leaving Sylvia
     behind.
     
                                                                  4.


     Sylvia watches her daughter run into the school building.
     She then crosses the street, and walks back in the direction
     she came from.

6    INT. ADULT RESIDENCE - HALLWAY / OFFICE ROOM. DAY                 6
     Sylvia enters the hallway and greets a resident, ILYA, who
     is happy to see her.
     He presents her with a mimed bouquet of flowers which she
     mimes taking off him, thanking him.
     She heads into the office where Karen and T ARINA are sitting
     at their desks. They greet her.

 7   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE - MAIN ROOM. LATER                           7
     Sylvia leads a group stretch with a handful of residents.

7A   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE - ROOM. LATER                                7A
     Sylvia is helping a resident, MARIO (30) to get ready to go
     for a walk.

                           SYLVIA
                 If you're going outside, you need a
                 jacket, Mario. I know you have two
                 things but it is so cold. Do you
                 want to do it yourself?

     Sylvia i s having trouble trying to convince Mario, so she
     gives up and they walk outside. Sylvia carries the jacket.

 8   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE - COMMON ROOM. TWO HOURS LATER               8
     Sylvia and Karen are taking breakfast to the residents in
     the common room.
     Sylvia asks Karen for a break so she can go to check on Anna
     at the school.

9    EXT. STREET / SCHOOL. DAY                                         9
     Students crowd the patio during recess. Anna and her friends
     sit on the steps leading to the school. Sylvia watches them
     from a bench across the street.
     Anna and Sylvia greet each other discretely from afar,
     eating lunch at a distance.
      
                                                                   5.


      One of Anna's friends greets Sylvia obnoxiously. Anna smiles
      through her discomfort. She can't tell whether her friends
      are making fun of her mother.
      A boy approaches Anna's group, chats with them, then leaves.
      Sylvia watches closely. Her phone rings. She puts her boxed
      lunch aside and answers.
                            SYLVIA
                  Hey... good... yeah. We had a good
                  time... I'm eating outside... No, I
                  don't go to school during rec ess
                  anymore... I swear I'm not outside.
                  Okay... Listen, could you lend me
                  some money to fix the fridge? It
                  broke again. Okay. See you in a
                  bit.

10    EXT. BEVERLY ROAD SUBWAY STATION (PROSPECT PARK SOUTH) DAY        10
      Anna and Sylvia get out of the subway. The neighborhood is
      noticeably different - mostly white faces, moms in work-out
      clothes pushing strollers or walking their small dogs along
      the pavement line d with high-end boutiques.

10A   EXT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE. DAY                                          10A
      Anna and Sylvia arrive at the house.

11    INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS                         11
      Sylvia is in the kitchen.

                            OLIVIA
                      (to Lucy)
                  Wash your hands.
                            LUCY
                  I already did.
                            OLIVIA
                  You were playing with Rocco.
      Lucy grudgingly washes her hands. Mark, Anna and Ashley come
      down. Mark continues to tease Anna, asking her to take a
      photo together for one of their frien ds. This makes Sylvia
      visibly uncomfortable.
      Olivia understands how anxious Sylvia gets when it comes to
      her daughter.

                                                          6.


                      OLIVIA (cont'd)
                (calling out)
            Cut it out, Mark!
Mark gives it a rest, sitting at the kitchen counter.
                      OLIVIA (cont'd)
            Are you staying for dinner?
                      SYLVIA
            No, we'll eat at home.

                      OLIVIA
            Are you going to the Woodbury event
            on Friday?
Sylvia's expression is lackluster.
                      OLIVIA (cont'd)
            Robert's not going.
Anna would like her mother to socialize more.
                      ANNA
            I'll be your date if you want.
                      SYLVIA
            Thank you, sweetie.
Sylvia sho ots Anna a look that says "don't butt into this".
                      OLIVIA
            It'll be good for you to spend time
            with...
She doesn't need to finish - the comment has already rubbed
Sylvia up the wrong way.
                      SYLVIA
            People who aren't from AA?
                      OLIVIA
            How did the anniversary meeting go?
Lucy runs to the table and sits back on her seat.
                      LUCY
            What anniversary?
                      OLIVIA
            Eat some salad.
                      SYLVIA
            It was nice.
                      (MORE)
     
                                                               7.

                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                     (to Anna)
                 Wasn't it?
     Anna nods.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I'll tell you about it later.
     Sylvia knows Olivia only asked to be polite, and would not
     appreciate an elaborate answer in front of the kids.
                           LUCY
                 What anniversary?
                           OLIVIA
                 Lucy, your food is getting cold.
     The dog goes up to Anna and rests his head on her knee. She
     strokes him.

12   INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM / TV ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON     12
     Sylvia i s having a cup of coffee on the sofa. The kids watch
     TV.
     Olivia comes over and hands Sylvia four hundred dollars in
     small bills.
                           OLIVIA
                 You don't have to pay me back
                 right away. It's not Robert's
                 money.
                           SYLVIA
                 Have you become a drug dealer?
                           OLIVIA
                 The students pay me in cash. Count
                 it. It should all be there.
     Sylvia puts away the money and smiles at Olivia.
                            OLIVIA (cont'd)
                 I've been meaning to tell you. Mom
                 k eeps asking about you and Anna.
                           SYLVIA
                 Is she staying long?
                           OLIVIA
                 What would she go back for? She
                 wasn't doing well without dad.
     
                                                                 8.


     Sylvia collapses onto the sofa and closes her eyes, wincing.
                           SYLVIA
                 Anna? We're leaving!
     Olivia remains quiet.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Could you get me an aspirin?
     Olivia goes to get one.

13   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN. DAY                           13
     The doorbell rings. Sylvia answers the intercom in her
     pajamas, still half asleep.
                             SYLVIA
                 Yes?

                           REFRIGERATOR REPAIR MAN (O.S.)
                 Hi ma'am... you've got a situation
                 with your fridge?
                            SYLVIA
                 I as ked for a repair woman...
                           REFRIGERATOR REPAIR MAN (O.S.)
                 She wasn't available today... do
                 you want me to leave?
                             SYLVIA
                 No.
     Sylvia buzzes the repair man in and escorts him into the
     kitchen to show the fridge.
     Anna comes into the kitchen barefoot in a pair of shorts.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Go back to your room.
                           ANNA
                 But I'm thirsty.
     Irritated, Anna grabs a glass and fills it with water from
     the sink. Sylvia turns her attention back to the repair man.
     Anna leaves the kitchen.
     
                                                               9.


14   INT. SIRICO - ENTRANCE HALL. DAY                               14
     Olivia and Sylvia walk into the foyer. About 200 people are
     gathered for the Woodbury High school fundraiser.
     Olivia excitedly greets an old classmate with a hug. Sylvia
     stands back and keeps quiet.
                             OLIVIA
                 Rebecca!
     REBECCA is obnoxiously happy to see Olivia.
                           OLIVIA (cont'd)
                 Has it been 15 years already??
                           REBECCA
                 More! I was pregnant -
     REBECCA'S HUSBAND appears. Olivia h ugs him. They chat. Even
     though Sylvia recognizes Rebecca, she stays silent and looks
     around. She's clearly regretting having come.
                           REBECCA (cont'd)
                 Sylvia? I haven't seen you in ages!
                           SYLVIA
                     (polite)
                 Hi. Is your sister here? She told
                 me she was coming.
                           REBECCA
                 She canceled last minute.
                           SYLVIA
                 I was looking forward to seeing
                 her.
     Olivia greets three girlfriends who are thrilled to see her.
     Rebecca walks off to greet some other fellow classmates.
     Sylvia leaves the group and enters the main room.

     She moves through the crowd, and sits down at an empty
     table. A WAITER approaches.
                           WAITER
                 What can I get you? We have red,
                 white -
     
                                                             10.


                           SYLVIA
                 Still water please.
     The waiter leaves. Sylvia watches people having fun. Most of
     them have just arrived, and greet their old classmates with
     affection.

16   INT. SIRICO'S - BALLROOM. DAY                                  16
     People are starting to get drunk. The mood is definitely
     more relaxed. Olivia is having a conversation with a pair of
     TWIN CLASSMATES, and tries to include Sylvia from time to
     time.

                           TWIN 1
                 I'm sorry but she was t oo much of a
                 fat-ass to be the P.E teacher.
                           OLIVIA
                 Dance teacher.
                           TWIN 2
                 She taught both. Dance and P.E...
                           OLIVIA
                 Did you have her too?
                           SYLVIA
                 Yes. I think I had her for P.E but
                 not for dance.
                           TWIN 1
                 Dance was an elective. But it was
                 worth it because it clashed with
                 Chemistry, which I hated...
     MEGAN, Olivia's classmate, interrupts to propose a toast.
     Musicians are tuning their instruments behind her.
                           MEGAN
                 Hello, hi... I want to thank
                 everyone for coming tonight. It
                 really goes to show how supportive
                 you all are, after all these
                 years... it's just so great to
                 see...
     Sylvia's eyes roam around the room and land on a man, SAUL,
     who's staring at her from across the room. She smiles
     briefly then looks away.
      
                                                                  11.


                            MEGAN (cont'd)
                  I'm sure I'm not the only one who
                  can say I've missed this - I've
                  missed Woodbury High...
      Sylvia sneaks a look back at the man. He's still got his
      eyes fixed on her. She looks back at him, unnerved, as the
      speech continues.
                            MEGAN (cont'd)
                  ...and what's crazy is that it
                  really feels like no time has
                  passed at all. So let's raise a
                  glass to all of you wonderful
                  people who made high school that
                  joyful period that it was...
      Sylvia turns her attention back towards Megan's speech,
      avoiding the man's gaze, trying to focus on the words being
      said.

16A   INT. SIRICO'S - BALLROOM.        LATER THAT NIGHT                 16A
      People are dancing to 80s music. Alone at her table, Sylvia
      has to deal with Saul's permanent gaze. He hasn't looked
      away once.
      Olivia dances with a group on the dance-floor. She looks
      back from ti me to time, checking on Sylvia, and signals for
      her to join them. Sylvia doesn't feel like dancing.
      Olivia gestures again for Sylvia to come over - but she's
      interrupted by a friend offering everyone shots of tequila
      on the dance-floor.
      Sylvia keeps looking to check whether Saul is still staring
      at her. He is. He's surrounded by a group of people,
      including his brother ISAAC, but his eyes are fixed on
      Sylvia.
      Isaac moves away when a WOMAN approaches Saul and asks him
      to dance. Saul accompanies her. Despite the fact that he's
      dancing with the woman, he keeps staring at Sylvia.
      An acquaintance greets the woman dancing with Saul. Saul
      stops dancing. He remains motionless in the middle of the
      dance-floor, eyes glued on Sylvia.
      Freaked out, Sylvia stands up. She grabs her coat and purse,
      storming ou t of the restaurant. Saul follows. Neither his
      dance partner nor Isaac see him leave.
     
                                                                12.


17   EXT. SIRICO'S / STREETS (BENSONHURST). NIGHT                     17
     Sylvia shivers in the crisp November air.
     She walks fast down the street, packed full of people
     enjoying their Friday night.

18   EXT. 71ST STREET SUBWAY STATION (BENSONHURST). NIGHT             18
     She doesn't realize Saul is following her until she reaches
     the subway station. She quickens her step.
     Saul shivers - he left his coat behind - but he continues to
     follow S ylvia.
     Sylvia taps her subway card on the reader and goes through
     the barrier.
     She heads up to the open-air platform. It's nearly empty
     except for a sprinkling of three or four commuters.
     Waiting on the platform, she sees Saul coming down the
     stairs.
     Sylvia moves away from him to stand further down the
     platform.
     A train arrives.
     She quickly gets on.

19   INT. SUBWAY TRAIN. CONTINUOUS                                    19
     Sylvia is sitting i n a near-empty subway car. Saul is
     standing nearby, looking at her.
     She shrinks into her seat and makes herself as small as she
     can.
     The train stops. Some people get on and off, but Saul stays
     on. Sylvia moves to a seat further down the carriage.

20   INT. SUBWAY - PLATFORM. NIGHT                                    20
     Sylvia gets off the train. She turns to see if Saul is still
     following.
     He gets off.
     
                                                              13.


21   EXT. SYLVIA'S NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT                               21
     Sylvia walks through her neighborhood.
     Saul follows.

22   EXT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS                             22
     Sylvia walks her street, opens the front door and gets
     inside.

23   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - STAIRS / ANNA'S BEDROOM.              23
     CONTINUOUS
     She makes her way up the stairs in the dark and deactivates
     the house alarm.
     Sylvia goes to the window, peeking through the blinds. Saul
     crosse s the street and looks up towards Anna's bedroom - the
     only illuminated room in the house.
     Sylvia turns off the light and shuts the blinds. She stands
     by the window, spying on Saul from the side gap.

24   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. NIGHT                        24
     Sylvia obsesses over dinner preparations. Anna walk towards
     her bedroom.
                           ANNA
                 Mom, I will be in my room.

25   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - ANNA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.                25
     An na is looking through the window to the street. She
     notices Saul.
     Sylvia arrives and closes the curtains. She looks nervous.
                           SYLVIA
                 What are you doing honey? Stay
                 away, from the window. Please go to
                 bed.
     Sylvia takes Anna to the bed and turns off the light.
     
                                                                14.


26   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. NIGHT                         26
     Sylvia is washing the dishes, very anxious, in the kitchen.
     She can't sleep.

27   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM / KITCHEN. LATER      27
     Sylvia watches Saul from the window in her room. She takes
     two sleeping pills out of a packet from the night table and
     dials a number as she heads to the kitchen.

     She pours herself a glass of water. The call goes t o
     voicemail.
                           SYLVIA
                 Karen, I'm sorry to call this
                 late. I normally wouldn't but I
                 think I'm about to have a nervous
                 breakdown. I can't explain it over
                 voicemail... Anyway, just wanted to
                 see if you'd pick up, since you
                 usually can't sleep either... call
                 me back if you can, okay?
     Sylvia hangs up and takes the pills. Her nerves make her
     short of breath - tiny sips of the water are all she can
     handle.

     INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM. DAWN                 28
28
     Sylvia lies in bed. She hasn't slept a wink. She gets up and
     walks up to the window. From the condensation on the glass
     she can tell how cold it is outside. Saul is still sitting
     on the curb, shaking uncontrollably.

29   EXT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING           29
     Sylvia walks out the house in pajamas. She stops in the
     middle of the street, keeping a safe distance from Saul.
                             SYLVIA
                 Get up.
     Saul struggles to stand, he's practically frozen.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 What do you want?
     Saul doesn't respond. Sylvia keeps the distance from him.
     Anna comes downstairs, groggy, and sees Saul.
     
                                                                15.


                             ANNA
                 Mom?
     Saul's eyes snap open.
                           SYLVIA
                 Go to your room!
     Anna goes back upstairs - turning to steal a look back at
     Saul, trying to figure out what's going on.
     Saul shuts his eyes. He's losing consciousness.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Do you have your phone?
     He mumbles something she can't make out.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Give me your phone.

     He doesn't respond. He seems to be unconscious. She looks
     for his phone in his pants and takes it out, using his face
     to unlock it.
     She searches for the most recent dialled number and calls.

                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Hello? Hi. I found Saul on the
                 street where I live... he was
                 outside in the cold... I have no
                 idea how he got here... yes, OK...
                 Sylvia. 264 39th Street. Yes, this
                 is my mobile.
     Sylvia hangs up.

30   EXT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - STREET. 20 MINUTES LATER               30
     Sylvia opens the front door.
                            ISAAC
                 Sylvia ? I'm Isaac. We spoke on the
                 phone?
     Sylvia steps aside.
     Saul's eyes open. He's not surprised to see his brother.
                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 Saul... are you alright?
     Saul is returning to his senses. Sylvia watches him closely.
     
                                                              16.


                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 Let's go home.
     Isaac checks Saul's temperature with the back of his hand,
     clocking how cold Saul's skin is.
     He helps Saul up and steadies him. He takes his coat off,
     puts it over his brother's shoulders and guides him towards
     the car.
     Sylvia watches Isaac help Saul into the back seat.

     Isaac comes back to talk to Sylvia.
                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 I was going crazy looking for him.
                 I called the police bu t they won't
                 move until someone's missing for 48
                 hours.
     Sylvia remains silent.
                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 Thank you so much.
     Isaac offers his hand, Sylvia shakes it, mechanically. He
     hands her his business card.
                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 If you ever need anything, please
                 call. You have my number. Thank you
                 for helping him.

     Sylvia watches Isaac get back into the car and drive away.
     She shuts the front door and looks back at Anna, who's been
     quietly watching the entire scene.

31   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - BATHROOM. DAY                              31
     Saul relaxes in a warm bath. He hears Isaac come in through
     the door and opens his eyes, but doesn't move his head.
     Saul gets out of the bath. Drying himself off, he sees his
     reflection in the mirror. He avoids his own gaze - turning
     away.

32   EXT. INDUSTRY CITY. DAY                                        32
     Happy families enjoy their Sunday at the outdoor shop ping
     centre. Isaac and Saul are sitting in a table outside a
     coffee shop. There is tension between the two of them.

                                                           17.


SARA (22) Isaac's daughter arrives carrying a backpack.
                        SAUL
            Sara!
                      SARA
            You really scared us...
The remark does not upset Saul. He gets up and hugs her.
                      ISAAC
            Would you like a cup of coffee?
                      SARA
            Hi dad... no, I'm OK.
                      SAUL
            Did you fly all the way here just
            to see me?
                        SARA
            Yes.
                      SAUL
            You're both taking this too far.
                      SARA
            You went missing for an entire
            night!
                      ISAAC
            It's a miracle you didn't catch
            pneumonia.
                       SAUL
            I have n't gotten sick in years.
                      ISAAC
            He was lost a minute ago.
                      SAUL
            I was not lost. I went to the
            bathroom.
                      ISAAC
            And you forgot how to get back.
                      SAUL
            That's enough!
Saul's outburst provokes an uncomfortable silence. People
nearby turn to look.
     
                                                             18.


                           SARA
                     (to Saul)
                 He cried on the phone.
     Isaac looks embarrassed, he did not want that bit of
     information to go public.
                           ISAAC
                 I'll go get coffee.
     Isaac leaves. Sara comforts Saul. He finds it hard to stay
     angry at her.
                           SARA
                 Do you remember leaving the party?
                             SAUL
                 No.
                           SARA
                 Did you leave alone?
                           SAUL
                 I don't know.
     Isaac returns empty-handed.

                           ISAAC
                 The line was too long.
     Saul seizes the moment to change the subject.
                            SAUL
                 H ow's... P...P...
                           ISAAC
                 Providence.
                           SARA
                 Good. I like it there.
     A pensive silence.

33   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. DAY                          33
     Sara opens her suitcase and gives Saul a gift - a book of
     Julian Schnabel paintings. Saul looks through it.
                           SAUL
                 I like it.
     
                                                                 19.


                           SARA
                 I knew you would. He's one of my
                 favorites.
     She gives him a vinyl of Brian Kelly songs. He puts it on
     and they listen to it together, sitting on the sofa.
                           SAUL
                 It's good.
     Sara takes something out of her bag and hangs it round
     Saul's neck.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 What is this?
                           SARA
                 You have to wear it when you go
                 out.
     He looks at it - it's a hand-made necklace with the house
     address and Isaac's number on a card.
                           SAUL
                 I'm not wearing this.
     She gives him a stern look.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 Okay. Can I wear it inside, at
                 least?
                           SARA
                 Sure. You can wear it inside.

34   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM. DAY                   34
     Sylvia is deep in thought, stretched out on her bed. The
     house alarm beeps - someone's arrived.
     Olivia walks into the room and sits on the bed next to her
     sister.
                           OLIVIA
                 Anna told me what happened.
     Anna stands in the doorway, looking concerned. She opens the
     curtains.
                           SYLVIA
                 He followed me home from the
                 Woodbury party. He is one of Ben's
                 friends.
      
                                                              20.


                            OLIVIA
                  Are you sure?
                            SYLVIA
                  Why else would he follow me home?
                            OLIVIA
                  What's his name?
                            SYLVIA
                  Saul Shapiro.

      Sylvia turns to Anna.
                            SYLVIA (cont'd)
                  Do you want to stay with Olivia
                  tonight?
      Anna agrees with her mom and leaves Olivia and Sylvia alone
      in the room. Sylvia covers herself with the blankets and
      continue sleeping.
      Olivia stays sitting in the bed, watching her sister.

      Sylvia is taking a shower. She seems very reflexive.

34B   INT. SYLVIA'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.                            34B
      Sylvia is wearing comfortable clothes. She is searching
      through her contacts to find Isaac's phone. She calls him.
                             SYLVIA
                  Hi Isaac. This is Sylvia, from...
                  The other morning I found Saul
                  outside my house... Yeah... I was
                  wondering if I can come visit you
                  today, if that's okay... Great.
                  Send me y our address... Thanks.

 35   EXT. SAUL'S HOUSE. DAY                                        35
      Sylvia walks towards Isaac and Saul's house.
      She reaches the door, rings the bell.

 36   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS                                 36
      Isaac opens the door. He recognizes Sylvia.

                                                         21.


                      ISAAC
            Hello! Come on in...
Sylvia enters. The house is tastefully decorated. Sara is
nearby. Isaac closes the door behind them and introduces
Sylvia to his daughter.
                      ISAAC (cont'd)
            This is my daughter, Sara.
Sara smiles and extends a hand. Sylvia shakes it, gripping
her purse tightly in the other.
                      ISAAC (cont'd)
            Sylvia found Saul.
                      SYLVIA
            I looked out my window in the
            morning and saw him in the street.
Sara tr ies not to laugh.
                      SARA
                (to Isaac)
            How did he get there?
                      ISAAC
            Thank God Sylvia found him.
                      SARA
            I'll go get him.
Sara gives Sylvia a grateful smile. Sylvia is nervous. Isaac
figures she's shy.
                      ISAAC
            Can I offer you anything to drink?
                      SYLVIA
            No, thanks. I have to head to work
            soon.

                      ISAAC
            On a Saturday?

                      SYLVIA
            I work at a residence for people *
            with developmental disabilities.
Sara returns with Saul. Though shy, he's visibly happy to
see Sylvia.
                        SAUL
            Hello.

                                                         22.


                        SARA
            Sylvia.
                      SAUL
            I know her name.
Sylvia's face turns red - her resentment misinterpreted for
timidity.
                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I apologize if I made you feel
            uncomfortable the other night.
                      SYLVIA
            It's fine.
                      SAUL
            Come. Sit down.
Sylvia hesitates but follows Sara and Isaac into the living
room.
                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I forget things. Recent things.
It's an awkward moment met with silence.

                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I'll get you a glass of water.
Sa ul leaves. Sylvia looks uncomfortable. She, Sara and Isaac
sit in silence.
                      ISAAC
            He has dementia.
                      SARA
            He remembers things from years ago
            but forgets immediate events.
                      ISAAC
            Our childhood. Our parents...
                      SARA
            The more recent, the less he
            remembers.
                      SYLVIA
            He remembered me.
                      ISAAC
            Sometimes he's good for weeks and
                      (MORE)
     
                                                              23.

                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 remembers everything. Then
                 something like the other night
                 happens. We're not sure why that
                 is.
     Saul returns with two glasses of water, hands one to Sylvia.
                           SYLVIA
                 Do you remember how you got to my
                 house?
                           SAUL
                 I remember being on the
                 subway. I remember your daughter's
                 long hair. I remember your house...
                 but I don't know how
                 I got there, no.
                           ISAAC
                 Do you remember the Woodbury party?
                            SAUL
                 I don't r ecall it being the same
                 day...
     Sara notices her uncle look uncomfortable. She changes the
     subject.
                           SARA
                     (to Sylvia)
                 They still work together. They're
                 accountants.

                           SAUL
                 Actually, I'm his boss. And this is
                 my house.
     Though Isaac seems a bit annoyed by this, they all laugh in
     unison.
                           ISAAC
                 He's the big brother. We have an
                 accounting firm.
                           SAUL
                 I hardly work anymore.
     Sylvia forces a smile.

37   EXT. RUNDOWN PARK. DAY                                         37
     Sa ul and Sylvia stroll through a rundown park. A few
     homeless people amble around.

                                                      24.


                       SYLVIA
             It's changed a lot right?
Saul looks around.
                       SAUL
             I guess it needs some taking
             care of.
                      SYLVIA
            I used to play here when I was
            little.
Saul nods.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            It was nicer then.
They walk in silence.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Do you remember things that
            happened a long time ago?
                        SAUL
            Yes.

                        SYLVIA
            Okay.
                      SAUL
            I think about my wife. I replay
            things from childhood. My parents.
            My cousins. Holidays.
                      SYLVIA
            What about school?
                       SAU L
             I remember school.
She sits down on a bench. He joins her.
                       SYLVIA
             What school did you go to?
                        SAUL
            Woodbury.
                        SYLVIA
            So did I.
                      SAUL
            What! Really??

                                                           25.


                      SYLVIA
            Don't you remember me?
                        SAUL
            No.
                      SYLVIA
            We've both changed after so many
            years.
                      SAUL
            We didn't go to school together.
                      SYLVIA
            I remember you perfectly.
This surprises Saul. He realizes Sylvia is upset. He holds
her gaze, trying to figure her out.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            You really don't remember me?
                        SAUL
            No.
                      SYLVIA
            Do you remember Ben Goldberg?
                      SAUL
            Yes. We were in the same class.
                       SYLVIA
            Ben used to get me drunk after
            sc hool. I was twelve, he was 17.
Saul pays close attention. Sylvia pauses, overcoming her
anger.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            He liked raping me. He liked
            forcing me to give him blow jobs.
                        SAUL
            Ben?

                       SYLVIA
            Sometimes he was alone. Other times
            he wasn't.
Saul finds this shocking.

                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Don't you remember?

                                                       26.


                      SAUL
            I remember Ben.
                      SYLVIA
            You don't remember being with him
            and making me suck your dick?
                        SAUL
            What?
                      SYLVIA
            You said you remember school.
                      SAUL
            I don't remember.
                      SYLVIA
            Why did you follow me home after
            the party?
Saul is troubled by Sylvia's pain, as much as by the
accusation.
                       SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Do you remember the Woodbury party
            last week?

Saul makes an effort.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Do you remember following me home?
                       SAUL
            I re member the party because Isaac
            showed me pictures. I remember you
            finding me on the street outside
            your house.
                      SYLVIA
            You followed me home.
                      SAUL
            From where?
                      SYLVIA
            From the Woodbury party!
                      SAUL
            You were at Woodbury party?
                      SYLVIA
            You followed me home from the
            Woodbury party.
     
                                                              27.


     Saul tries to process everything.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 And you sexually abused me when I
                 was twelve and you were seventeen
                 or eighteen.
                           SAUL
                 Are you sure?
                           SYLVIA
                 Do you like thinking about what you
                 used to do to me?
     Instead of getting defensive, Saul tries to remember.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Or do you only remember when it's
                 convenient??
     The harder he tries, the angrier Sylvia grows.
                           SAUL
                 I don't remember.
                           SYLVIA
                 You deserve b eing the way you are.
     Sylvia rips Sara's identification card from his neck. Saul
     is confused.
     She takes off without looking back. Saul stands but does not
     follow. He watches her leave.

38   INT. SUBWAY STATION. AFTERNOON.                                38
     Sylvia is coming back to her house. She is waiting for the
     subway at the station. The train arrives and she stands up
     to get in but she hesitates and doesn't enter.
     The subway doors c lose. Sylvia stays alone in the station.

39   EXT. RUNDOWN PARK. DUSK.                                       39
     Sylvia is back in the park. Saul is no longer sitting on the
     bench. She checks everywhere but the park is empty.
                           SYLVIA
                 Saul! Saul!
     Anxious, she takes out her phone and dials a number. It goes
     straight to voicemail.
     
                                                                 28.


                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Hey, Isaac. It's Sylvia. Could you
                 call me back please? Thanks.

40   EXT. RUNDOWN PARK - GARBAGE BINS. END OF DAY                      40
     Saul is urinating against the wall behind some large
     industrial bins. A few homeless men are milling around in
     the background.
     Sylvia sees Saul from the distance and she walks towards
     him, relieved. Saul stands still watching her.
     As Saul walks towards Sylvia she turns and wa lks out of his
     reach.
     Saul notices she's been crying. He walks a few feet behind
     her. His phone rings. Sylvia takes it out of her purse and
     hands it to him.
                           SAUL
                 Isaac... fine. We went for coffee
                 and a long walk. We're on our way
                 back home... she called to tell you
                 that we'd be a while... yeah, she's
                 here. See you.
     Saul ends the call. He follows Sylvia, who watches him from
     the corner of her eye.

     IN T. SAUL'S HOUSE - STUDY. DAY
41                                                                     41
     Saul examines a picture of Ben Goldberg in his school
     yearbook. He listens to the song A Whiter Shade of Pale by
     Procol Harum.
     There's a picture of Saul on the same page. He analyzes both
     photos, jotting things down in his notebook.
     He turns the yearbook pages, looking for a photo of Sylvia,
     but doesn't find one.

42   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. DAY                                      42
     Sylvia is asleep on the sofa after a late-night binge. Empty
     packets of crisps, peanuts, pretzels and biscuits lie around
     her.
     The doorbell rings. She wakes, groggy and answers the
     intercom.

                                                         29.


                       SARA (O.S)
            Hi, it's Sara... Saul's niece. Can
            I come in?
Sylvia buzzes her up. She smooths her hair as Sara comes in.
                      SARA
            I'm sorry... were you sleeping?
                      SYLVIA
            Oh. No. Don't worry.

                      SARA
            So I know this may be random but
            I'm leaving today. I study in
            Boston, and... since you and Saul
            got along, my dad and I thought
            maybe you could care for my uncle
            during the day.
                      SYLVIA
            I'm not a nurse.
                      SARA
            He doesn't want a nurse. You'd only
            have to be there. Take walks...
                      SYLVIA
            I don't think I can.
                      SARA
            We could pay you full-time.
Sylvia considers this.
                      SARA (cont'd)
            He talks about you a lot.
                      SYLVIA
            Let me think about it. I'll call
            your dad.

                        SARA
            Here.
Sara takes out some cash from her wallet.
                      SARA (cont'd)
            We'll pay in advance. In cash. Even
            if you say no, we'd like you to
            keep the money as a gesture of
            thanks for helping my uncl e...
Sylvia doesn't accept the envelope.
     
                                                                 30.


                           SARA (cont'd)
                 You could try it for a few
                 afternoons...
     She proffers the money again. Sylvia takes it.

43   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE. DAY                                         43
     Sylvia is absent-minded, washing some dishes at the adult
     residence. She doesn't care much about what's happening
     around.

44   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT                                    44
     Sylvia sits, thinking.

45   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - ANNA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                   45

     Sylvia scours every corner of Anna's room. She organizes her
     daughter's drawers and closet. She can't help but looking
     through Anna's stuff. She finds a joint in Anna's pencil
     case.
     She attempts to log into Anna's computer but the password is
     invalid.

46   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. MORNING                                  46
     Sylvia has been up all night cleaning. She cleans her
     bedroom.
     She hears the house alarm beep. Anna and Olivia have come
     in.
     Sylvia goes to greet them. Anna r uns to her bedroom.
                           SYLVIA
                 I decided to make the most of it
                 and got the whole house clean...
     Anna yells from her bedroom.
                           ANNA (O.S.)
                 You went through my stuff!
                           SYLVIA
                 I organized.
     Anna comes back. She raises her voice, upset, trying to get
     Olivia on her side.
     
                                                              31.


                           ANNA
                 Why were you spying on me?
                           SYLVIA
                 I found a joint in your pencil
                 case.
     Olivia wants no part in this. Anna knows she's in trouble.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I want to see what's on your
                 computer. You changed the password.
                           ANNA
                 You don't need to see what's on my
                 computer.
                           SYLVIA
                 Stop talking back!
                           ANNA
                 I hate my life!
     Anna storms out of the house, slamming the door.
                           SYLVIA
                     (to Olivia)
                 Am I wrong?
     Olivia doesn't answer.
     Sylvi a sits down and shuts her eyes, suddenly overcome with
     exhaustion.

47   INT. CHURCH HALL (SUNSET PARK). NIGHT                          47
     At an AA meeting Sylvia sits next to Emily who talks through
     sobs. Sylvia looks at her, but her mind is elsewhere.
                           EMILY
                 ...without even asking. Last
                 month... I didn't care if my
                 parents found out. It would have
                 been better if they had... I just
                 didn't care. With who or where it
                 was... I'd have sex... when I went
                 to get tested, I was sure I'd get a
                 positive somewhere...
     Karen hands Sylvia a cup of tea, pulling Sylvia back into
     the room. She rubs Sylvia's shoulder, supportive.
     
                                                              32.


48   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM. DAY.                     48
     Sylvia is looking through messages in the living room.
     Olivia enters the house and gives her a cup of coffee.
                           OLIVIA
                 You never met Saul at school...
                             SYLVIA
                 What?
                           OLIVIA
                 Saul's family are from Reading.
                 They moved in `86 - the year you
                 stopped going to Woodbury.

                           SYLVIA
                 How do you know?
                           OLIVIA
                 Yearbooks, phone calls.
     Sylvia looks upset. But that makes her think about it.
     Olivia feels pity about her sister and leaves.

49   INT / EXT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT / OLIVIA'S CAR - DAY.            49
     Olivia exits her sister's house and jumps into her SUV in
     the backseat. The chauffer starts driving. In the backseat
     is SAMANTHA (70), Olivia and Sylvia's fancy mother. Olivia
     looks through the window, worried.
                           SAMANTHA
                 How is she? Is she doing better?
     Olivia nods.
                             SAMANTHA (cont'd)
                 Great.
     Samantha is not so happy about the place where her daughter
     lives.
                           SAMANTHA (cont'd)
                 I don't love this neighborhood. Is
                 it even safe around here for Anna
                 to grow up?... I'd be happy to give
                 them some money so they can move to
                 a better place.
     
                                                                33.


                           OLIVIA
                 We've offered.
                           SAMANTHA
                 Have you? You're such a good
                 sister. Thank you. That's nice.
                           OLIVIA
                 It's nice in the inside. It's very
                 sweet.

50   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM. DAY.                  50
                             SYLVIA
                 Saul.
                           ISAAC (O.S.)
                 Who is it?
                             SAUL
                 Sylvia!
     Sylvia doesn't say anything.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 Would you like to come in?
     She enters. Saul closes the door behind her. Isaac arrives,
     his presence easing the tension.
                           ISAAC
                 I thought you couldn't come today.
                           SYLVIA
                 I can stay if you'd like.
                           ISAAC
                 Great. I'll get my shoes.
     Isaac leaves - the tension returns.
     They walk into the living room. Saul sits down. Sylvia sits
     across from him. Isaac rushes past the living room, talking
     on his mobile phone. He gestures goodbye and leaves,
     slamming the door on his way out.
     Saul grabs his notebook. He reads through the notes he's
     taken dow n.
                           SYLVIA
                 I made a mistake. It wasn't you.
     Saul is relieved. He wants to clear the air.

                                                         34.


                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            You registered in `86, which is the
            year my parents made me switch
            schools. My mom didn't believe me
            when I told her about Ben. She
            thought it'd be easier to put me in
            a different school. You and I had
            never seen each other before the
            other night.
                      SAUL
            I remember Ben.
                      SYLVIA
            You had nothing to do with it.
Saul takes out his notebook and starts to write.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            What are you doing?

                      SAU L
            I'm writing it down so I can
            remember. Is that OK?
                        SYLVIA
            OK...
                      SAUL
            Why didn't your mom believe you?
Sylvia is quiet.

                      SAUL (cont'd)
            Do you feel like talking about it?

                      SYLVIA
            Why did you follow me the other
            night?
                      SAUL
            I don't know.
He feels uncomfortable not knowing - he hates his condition.

                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I don't remember.
Silence. Sylvia laughs out loud. Saul doesn't understand
why. Then he understands the whole situation is absurd, and
smiles.
     
                                                                 35.


51   INT. ELECTRONICS STORE. DAY                                       51
     Through a store window we see Sylvia comparing two mobile
     phones, a sales girl standing nearby.

52   INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE. DAY                                          52
     Sylvia rings the doorbell, holding a gift bag. Mark opens.
                             MARK
                 Hi.
     He runs back to the sofa, where he's watching TV with Anna,
     Ashley, Robert and Olivia. Sylvia approaches them. Olivia
     meets her halfway, greeting her sister with a kiss.
     Anna is sti ll mad - she ignores her mom.
                             ASHLEY
                 Hi.
                           ROBERT
                 Sylvia, hello.
     Robert attempts to be nice but doesn't stand to greet her.
                             SYLVIA
                 Anna.
     Sylvia approaches Anna. Anna's behavior changes when her
     mother hands her a new iPhone.
                             ANNA
                 Mom!
     She tears it open.
                           SYLVIA
                 Forgive me?
     Anna gives her mother a kiss.
                           ANNA
                 How could you afford this?
                           SYLVIA
                 I got a second job.
                           OLIVIA
                 What kind of a job?
                           SYLVIA
                 I'm working with the guy tha t
                           (MORE)

                                                        36.

                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            followed me home after the Woodbury
            event.
Ashley joins Anna as she takes her iPhone out of its
packaging and sets it up. Sylvia is pleased - she needs to
be at peace with Anna.
Mark feels the good mood in the room and he decides to ask
Sylvia something.
                      MARK
            I was wondering if Anna could come
            to a party on Friday?
                      SYLVIA
            Are there gonna be other kids your
            age there?
                        MARK
            Yes.
                        SYLVIA
            Then no.
                        ANNA
            Told you.

                      ASHLEY
            Would you like something to drink
            Syl?
Robert gives Olivia a disapproving look.

                      LUCY
            Want a beer, Aunt Sylvia?
                      SYLVIA
            No, thank you.
                      LUCY
            Why don't you ever drink beer?
                      SYLVIA
            Because I'm an alcoholic Lucy.

                        ROBERT
            Sylvia...

                      SYLVIA
            She asked a question.
While Robert disapproves, Olivia doesn't budge - she thinks
it's important that her children understand Sylvia's
condition.
     
                                                              37.


                           ASHLEY
                 What happens if you drink just one?
                           SYLVIA
                 I'll relapse. I haven't had a drink
                 in thirteen years.
                           ASHLEY
                 Since Anna was born?
                           SYLVIA
                 She's the reason I stopped.
                           ROBERT
                 This conversation's over.
                           MARK
                 Did you take drugs or did you just
                 drink?
                           ROBERT
                 That's enough!
                             ANNA
                 Let's go.
     Anna puts on her shoes and heads for the door without saying
     goodbye. Robert turns the volume up on the television.

     INT. SAUL'S H OUSE - KITCHEN. DAY
53                                                                  53
     Sylvia puts the finishing touches on an elaborate dish she's
     just made. She takes it to the kitchen counter where Saul is
     waiting and checks to make sure it isn't too hot. Saul eats,
     enjoying the meal.
                           SAUL
                 This is delicious.
     Pleased by the compliment, Sylvia serves herself a plate and
     joins Saul.
                           SYLVIA
                 What should we do after lunch?
                           SAUL
                 Whatever you feel like doing.
                           SYLVIA
                 Would you l ike to watch a film?
                             SAUL
                 Yes.
     
                                                              38.


54   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - STUDY. DAY                                 54
     Saul and Sylvia watch a movie.
                           SYLVIA
                 I'm going to the bathroom.
                           SAUL
                 Pause the film.
                           SYLVIA
                 It's fine. I'll be quick.
     Saul watches her walk away before turning his attention back
     to the film. An entire scene finishes by the time she gets
     back.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 So what happened?
     Saul squints at her.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Could they open the car?
                           SAUL
                 Rewind it if you want.
     Sylvia rewind s to the scene, watching Saul from the corner
     of her eye. She's thinking about something other than the
     film.
                           SYLVIA
                 Are you enjoying the film?
                             SAUL
                 Yes.
     They pretend to watch.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 I don't understand anything. I
                 can't watch films.
                           SYLVIA
                 Why didn't you tell me?
                           SAUL
                 So you could watch it.
     Sylvia is at a loss. They continue watching the film for a
     moment, stealing glances at one another. Saul starts
     la ughing. Sylvia joins in.
     
                                                                 39.


55   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - STUDY. LATE AFTERNOON                         55
     While Saul naps on the sofa, Sylvia goes through family
     albums. She wants to know more about him. It becomes clear
     that Saul's ex-wife and Sylvia have a strong resemblance -
     same figure, same hair color and hairstyle.
     She finds a Vinyl on the player - A Whiter Shade of Pale.
     The record sleeve has a dedication from Saul's ex-wife.
     Holiday photos: young Is aac with his wife and little Sara,
     Saul and his wife at the beach.
     Photos of Saul's university graduation.
     Photos of African landscapes: twenty year-old Saul posing
     for a photo, backpack hanging off one shoulder.

     Sylvia puts the photo album back on the shelf. She picks up
     a school yearbook. She discovers a photo of Saul when he was
     seventeen. She turns to look at him and compares him to the
     photograp h.
     She examines photos of other students. Little by little,
     falling back into the trap of old thoughts and memories.

56   INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE. DAY                                          56
     Anna and Ashley hold a rope for Lucy, showing her how to
     jump the rope.
     Samantha comes in carrying shopping bags. Ashley and Lucy
     run up to greet her. They kiss their grandmother and take
     the bags from her, then run back to join Anna.

                           ROBERT
                 Thanks Samantha.

                           SA MANTHA
                 My pleasure.
     Anna looks nervous, not sure what to do.
                           SAMANTHA (cont'd)
                 Hi Anna. I would have gotten you a
                 present too...
                           OLIVIA
                 To get Sylvia even more upset?
                           SAMANTHA
                 Should I leave?

                                                          40.


                      OLIVIA
            No mom... would you like some
            coffee?
                        SAMANTHA
            Yes.
                        OLIVIA
            Anna?
                        ANNA
            A coke.
Olivia heads into the kitchen.
                      ROBERT
            Were you able to make the Airbnb a
            long term rental?
                      SAMANTHA
            I talked to the owner. He's
            formalizing it.
Samantha pulls up a chair so Anna can sit next to her.
Robert joins Olivia in the kitchen.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            I've seen pictures of you, Anna.
            Olivia shows them to me. It's so
            nice to fina lly see you in person.
Anna knows she shouldn't be talking to her grandmother.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            You look like your mother.
                      ANNA
            We all look alike.
                      SAMANTHA
            Thank goodness no one took after
            your grandpa.
Samantha is kidding.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            May he rest in peace.
Anna smiles. Robert and Olivia come back with drinks.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            I'll have my coffee and get going.
            I don't want to upset your mom.
     
                                                                 41.


                           ANNA
                 I won't tell.
     Lucy joins them in the dining room. She wears a new shirt.
     Ashley takes a bit longer to show off her new coat. Samantha
     makes them twirl - taking pleasure in how they look wearing
     their gifts.
     Lucy takes her grandmother by the hand and guides her back
     to her room.
                           LUCY
                 Come to my room and I'll show you
                 the rest...

     Samantha lets herself be guided. Ashley follows.
                           ASHLEY
                     (to Anna)
                 Come on!
     Anna follows.

57   INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT. NIGHT                                      57
     The waiter finishes taking Sylvia and Anna's order at the
     bar.
                           WAITER
                 One eel bowl, marinated Tuna roll,
                 one edamame and two miso soups.

                             ANNA
                 Yes.

     The waiter leaves.
                           ANNA (cont'd)
                 How's your new job?
                             SYLVIA
                 Great.
                           ANNA
                 Are you gonna stop working at the
                 residence?
                           SYLVIA
                 No, but I'll be taking care of Saul
                 on the weekends, too.
     A YOUNG WAITER, handsome and young, arrives holding a
     pitcher.

                                                        42.


                      YOUNG WAITER
            Would you like some water?
                      ANNA
            Yes, please.
                      YOUNG WAITER
            With or without ice?
                      ANNA
            Without... actually with.

They smile at each other.
                      SYLVIA
                (to the young waiter)
            How old are you?
                        YOUNG WAITER
            Fifteen.
                      SYLVIA
            What are you doing working at
            night?
                      YOUNG WAITER
            It's my dad's restaurant... with or
            without ice?
                        SYLVIA
            Without.
As he pours water in Sylvia's glass he and Anna smile at
each other. He leaves. Their mutual attraction is obvious -
Sylvia is taken aback. The moment becomes uncomfortable.

                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            That kid's a character...
Anna smiles.
                      ANNA
            I want to go on a date.
Sylvia's mood shifts.
                      SYLVIA
            Don't start. We've talked about
            this.
                       ANNA
            He's in my class. I'm the only girl
            in my class who doesn't have a
            boyfriend.
     
                                                                43.


                           SYLVIA
                 What would you do with a boyfriend?
                           ANNA
                 Forget it mom.
     Another waiter arrives and pours each of them a cup of green
     tea.

58   EXT. SAUL'S HOUSE. DAY                                           58

     It's Saturday. Sylvia rushes towards Saul's house, talking
     on the phone.

                           SYLVIA
                 Yes... I'm here... Okay.
     Isaac is giving her directions on the other end of the line.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I see them...
     Reaching behind a potted plant, she picks up the house keys
     and opens the front door.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I'm opening the door... okay. Bye.
     She ends the call, walks inside and shuts the door.

59   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - HALLWAY / BATHROOM / SAUL'S BEDROOM.         59
                           SYLVIA
                 Hello! I'm here!
     No answer. Sylvia heads for Saul's bedroom. He's not there.
     She hears the sound of the shower running.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I'm here! I...
     She hears a groan. She hesitates before opening the bathroom
     do or, until the sound of Saul's groaning grows more
     alarming.
     She walks in and finds Saul in a foetal position on the
     floor of the shower, disoriented. She goes to help him up.
     He looks at her, confused.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 Where are you hurt?

                                                            44.


He doesn't answer. He manages to get to his feet. They make
it to the bed. She checks his body, doesn't find any damage.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Did you hit your head?
She continues looking for a surface wound, but everything
looks fine.
She goes to the bathroom and turns the shower off. When she
gets back she finds him stretched out naked on the bed. She
covers him with a sheet and examines his pupils.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            Can you hear me?
                        SAUL
            Yes.
                      SYLVIA
            I'm calling Isaac so he can send in
            a doctor.
                        SAUL
            No.
Saul sits up on the bed.
                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I'm okay now.
                      SYLVIA
            How long have you been lying there?
                      SAUL
            I don't know.
He looks anguished but makes an effort to show he's okay.
                      SAUL (cont'd)
            I'll get dressed. Don't worry.
                      SYLVIA
            Are you sure?
                      SAUL
            Yes. I'm hungry.
His behavior reassures Sylvia - but now his nudity makes her
unco mfortable.
                      SYLVIA
            I'll see you in the kitchen.
     
                                                              45.


                           SAUL
                 Thank you.
     Sylvia leaves. Saul is angry with himself. He slowly gets to
     his feet.
     He goes to the dressing room, and picks clothes. He looks at
     his reflection in the mirror as he gets dressed. Upon
     examination, he decides he looks like a stranger - one he
     wouldn't like.

60   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY                                60
     Sylvia and Saul are washing the dishes. They're listening to
     "A whiter shade of pale" by Proc ol Harum. Saul is telling
     Sylvia some fun facts about the songs and he talks about his
     wife.
                           SYLVIA
                 I didn't know you were married.
                           SAUL
                 I was. She passed away a long time
                 ago.
                           SYLVIA
                 I'm sorry.
     There's an awkward silence in the kitchen.

61   INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE. NIGHT.                                    61
     INSERT PHONE SCREEN: PICTURES OF KIDS ON WHEELCHAIRS.
     Anna is looking at the pictures. In some of them Samantha is
     hugging the kids.

                           SA MANTHA
                 I want to do the same here. I've
                 been in contact with a few
                 organizations.
                           ANNA
                 You pay for the wheelchairs?
                           SAMANTHA
                 I find the donors.
                           ANNA
                 Are you staying here, for sure?

                                                       46.


                      SAMANTHA
            It doesn't make sense for me to go
            back to Miami when you're here.
            What would I go back for?
                      ANNA
            When did Grandpa pass away?
                      SAMANTHA
            Less than a year ago.
Anna looks at the pictures.
                      ANNA
            Why did you and mom stop talking?
                      SAMANTHA
            Your mother was out drinking and
            going out with boys when she was
            your age. She was out of control, I
            couldn't handle her. She kept
            lying. She would then ask me to
            stand up for her and for the things
            she did while she was drunk...
                        ANNA
            Lying?
                      SAMANTHA
            She kept making things up... it's
            similar to what happened with that
            man she's working for now.

Anna doesn't see what her grandmother is getting at.
Samantha elaborates.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            Your mother accused him for
            something he wasn't guilty of...
            She's always been hard to deal
            with.
                      ANNA
            Not with me.

                      SAMANTHA
            That's different, s he's a good
            mother. Though maybe a bit
            controlling with you, isn't she?
                        ANNA
            Maybe.
     
                                                                 47.


                           SAMANTHA
                 I'd say not allowing you and I to
                 see each other is controlling.
                           ANNA
                 You stopped talking because of what
                 happened to her in school?
                           SAMANTHA
                 When I stopped standing up for the
                 things she lied about, she stopped
                 talking to us.
     Anna feels bad letting her mother be talked about in this
     way. She considers what her grandmother has said.

62   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN. NIGHT                                62
     Saul listens music while eating on the kitchen counter and
     writing some notes in his notebook. Sylvia does the dishes.
     Isaac hurries inside.
                           ISAAC
                 I'm sorry I'm late... is everything
                 OK?

                           SYLVIA
                 Yes, but now I'm running late
                 myself.
     Isaac pulls out a set of keys, places them on the counter.
                           ISAAC
                 It's better if you have your own.
                           SYLVIA
                 There's leftover pasta if you're
                 hungry. My daughter is waiting for
                 me.
     Sylvia readies herself to le ave. She grabs the keys, looks
     for her purse.
                           ISAAC
                 Could you come tomorrow?
                           SYLVIA
                 Only if I can bring my daughter.
                           ISAAC
                 Of course.
     
                                                           48.


                           SYLVIA
                 See you tomorrow.
                           SAUL
                 Thank you.
     Sylvia and Saul exchange smiles. She leaves.

63   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE. DAY                                      63
     Sylvia watches Anna and Saul play GUESS WHO.
                           ANNA
                 Does he have a mustache?
                             SAUL
                 No.
     Anna eliminates three characters.

                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 Is it a man?
                             ANNA
                 Yes.

     Saul eliminates half of the characters.
                           ANNA (cont'd)
                 Does he have a hat?
                             SAUL
                 Yes.
     Anna eliminates four characters.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 Is he a redhead?
                             ANNA
                 Yes.
     S aul eliminates all but three of the characters.
                           ANNA (cont'd)
                 Does he wear glasses?
                             SAUL
                 No.
     An alarm sounds on Sylvia's phone.
     
                                                             49.


                             SYLVIA
                 The oven.
     She rushes to the kitchen.
                           SAUL
                 Is it your turn or mine?
                             ANNA
                 My turn.
                           SAUL
                 Are you sure?
     An alarm sounds on Saul's phone.
                           SAUL (cont'd)
                 Time for my pills.
     Saul tries to stand up but Sylvia stops him.
                           SYLVIA
                 Oh, don't worry. I'll bring your
                 pills. You two keep playing.
     Anna and Saul continues with the game.

64   EXT. SAUL'S HOUSE / OLIVIA'S CAR. DUSK.                        64

     Olivia pulls up in an Uber in front of Saul 's house. Anna
     kisses Sylvia goodbye and walks out, greeting Olivia who has
     stepped out for a moment.
                             SYLVIA
                 Thanks!
                           OLIVIA
                 Have you decided if you're quitting
                 yet?
                           SYLVIA
                 Yes. I told Karen.
     Saul joins Sylvia on the doorstep.
                           OLIVIA
                 I never liked it there. Lots of
                 weird people, right? Hi! You must
                 be Saul. Olivia. Sylvia's sister.
     Saul smiles.
     
                                                                 50.


                           SYLVIA
                 Thanks again for taking Anna.
     Sylvia waves goodbye. Olivia gets back in the Uber with Anna
     and they drive away.

65   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - STUDY. NIGHT                                  65
     Saul and Sylvia are watching a film on TV. He's lying on the
     bed, nodding off.

     The sentimental film moves Sylvia - she tries not to cry.
     Sylvia glances over at Saul. She sees him sleeping, turns
     her attention back to the film.
     A scene makes her cry. She tries to be quiet as she sobs.
     Saul opens his eyes and watches her cry, then starts
     sobbing. Worried, Sylvia mutes the volume. His weeping
     starts to sound like a panic attack. She embraces him. He
     gradually calms down, like a child in his mother's arms.
     Sylvia hugs him, caressing the back of his head. She watches
     the muted film and rocks Saul back to sleep.
     She continues crying silently, without waking him. She
     cradles him - her eyes glued to the television set.

66   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - STUDY / STAIRS / HALLWAY. DAY                 66
     Sylvia and Saul have spent the night in each other's arms
     and are in a deep, peaceful sleep. They don't hear the front
     door open.
                             SARA (O.S.)
                 Hello!
     Sylvia continues to sleep while Saul momentarily opens his
     eyes, then shuts them again.
                             SARA (O.S.) (cont'd)
                 Saul?
     The door inches open. S ara peeks inside, and smiles to see
     them asleep together. She pulls her phone out and snaps a
     photo.
     Sylvia wakes up and sees Sara walking away from the room.
     Sylvia sits up, dressed in her clothes from the day before.
     Groggy, she off the couch.
     
                                                              51.


     She walks out the room, embarrassed when she's confronted by
     Sara.
                           SYLVIA
                 It's not what it looks like.
     Sara remains quiet.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 He started crying last night while
                 we were watching a film. I wanted
                 to help.
     Sylvia gets increasingly upset. She takes out the house keys
     from her purse and leaves them on the table.
                             SARA
                 I see...
     Sylvia heads for the front door and leaves the house. Saul
     comes out of h is room.
                           SAUL
                 Where is she?
                             SARA
                 She left.

67   INT. SYLVIA'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.                             67
     Sylvia arrives to her house and hurries to the bed. She lies
     there, crying.

68   EXT. SCHOOL / STREET. DAY                                      68
     Sylvia waits outside school. Anna comes out.
                           ANNA
                 Wasn't Olivia supposed to come?

                           SYLVIA
                 She's not picking up her phone.
                 She's probably with Samantha.
                           ANNA
                 Why aren't you with Saul?
     They start walking.

                           SYLVIA
                 Does Samantha visi t them often?
      
                                                              52.


                            ANNA
                  I don't know mom.
      Sylvia knows she should stop probing, but can't help
      herself.
                            SYLVIA
                  Do they mention her when you're
                  around?
                              ANNA
                  No, mom.
      Anna feels bad lying.

68A   EXT/INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT / MARK'S CAR. DAY                 68A
      Sylvia and Anna approach the house - surprised to find Saul
      and Sara waiting outside with Isaac's car.

                            SAUL
                  Can we talk?
                            SYLVIA
                  Anna, go inside.

      Anna complies. Sara realizes Sylvia is still u pset.
                            SARA
                  I'll leave you two.
      Sara gets back into Isaac's car to give them some privacy.
                            SAUL
                  Why did you leave?
                            SYLVIA
                  I don't want things to get
                  complicated.
                            SAUL
                  What do you mean?
                            SYLVIA
                  I got my job back... it's better
                  for me to stick to a routine.
                            SAUL
                  Why do you want to stop working
                  with me?
      Sylvia won't say what she's thinking.
      
                                                              53.


                            SAUL (cont'd)
                  Is it because Sara walked in on us?
                            SYLVIA
                  I'm glad we met, really.
      Sylvia goes inside her house. Saul goes back to the car and
      gets in. He takes out his notebook and scribbles something
      down. Sara watches him in the rear-view mirror.

68B   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM / KITCHEN. DAY      68B
      Sylvia enters the house.
      Anna's been watching through Sylvia's bedroom window.
                            ANNA
                  They're not coming in?
                              SYLVIA
                  No.
                            ANNA
                  They didn't want to or you wouldn't
                  let them?
      Anna walks over to the window and watches the car drive off.
                            ANNA
                  Are you mad at Saul?
                              SYLVIA
                  No.
                            ANNA
                  What did he do?
                              SYLVIA
                  Nothing.
      Pensive, Sylvia walks into the kitchen and washes her hands.
                            ANNA
                  Why don't you ever tell me the
                  truth?
      Sylvia ignores Anna.

69    INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - SAUL'S BEDROOM. CONTINUOUS                 69
      Isaac on the phone:

                                                        54.


                      ISAAC
            Let me know so I know if I need to
            cancel my afternoon appointments...
            OK... thank you Sylvia.
Isaac hangs up. Saul is next to him.
                      SAUL
            Why isn't she coming?
                      ISAAC
            She said she couldn't. I didn't ask
            why.
The news upset Saul.
                      ISAAC (cont'd)
            I'm going to have to cancel my date
            with Rachel.
Saul isn't really paying attention.
                      ISAAC (cont'd)
            Would you come?
                      SAUL
            I don't want to see Rachel, and you
            don't have to c ancel your
            appointments.
                      ISAAC
            You're staying here, locked up all
            day?
                      SAUL
            I'd rather stay here than be taken
            on your date like a pet.
Isaac doesn't want to argue - he lets his brother be.
                      SAUL (cont'd)
            Could you lend me a notebook?
                      ISAAC
            Yeah... sure.
Isaac dials a number on his phone and walks out of Saul's
room.
                      ISAAC (O.S.)
            Hey, sorry I can't make it
            tonight...
     
                                                              55.


70   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                             70
     Saul is lying on the bed, he seems depressed. In his phone,
     "A whiter shade of pale" is playing. Saul repeats the song
     over and over.

71   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY                                71
     Isaac is taking some coffee and getting ready to leave. Saul
     is looking through the window.

                           ISAAC
                 I couldn't find anyone to help us
                 today so you'll have to stay here
                 alone.
                           SAUL
                 It's okay.
                           ISAA C
                 Unless you want to stay with the
                 neighbors.
                             SAUL
                 No.
                           ISAAC
                 Okay. Call me if you need anything.

     Saul is fixing his hair in front of the mirror. He picks up
     a jacket and goes outside.
     A note in the door says DO NOT WALK OUT!
     Saul ignores it.

73   INT. UBER. DAY.                                                73

74   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE. DAY                                      74
     Karen opens the door to let Sau l in, who is outside.
                           KAREN
                 Hello, may I help you?
     
                                                               56.


                           SAUL
                 I'm looking for Feinstein House.
                           KAREN
                 This is it.
                           SAUL
                 Is Sylvia here?
                           KAREN
                 Yes, she's here. What is your name?

                             SAUL
                 Saul.

                           KAREN
                 Okay. Wait here please.
     He catches Sylvia's eye, and walks up to her.
                           SYLVIA
                 What are you doing here?
                           SAUL
                 I need to talk to you.
                           SYLVIA
                 What happened?
                           SAUL
                 Can we go somewhere private?
                           SYLVIA
                 Of course...
     Sylvia calls out to Jessica, still drying dishes in the
     small kitchen.
                           S YLVIA
                 I'll be back in a minute.
     She gestures for Saul to follow her.

75   EXT. ADULT RESIDENCE. DAY                                       75
     She leads Saul to a pantry full of dry foods and turns on
     the light, closing the door.
     She looks worried.
                           SYLVIA
                 What's going on?
     
                                                               57.


     Saul doesn't say anything.
                           SYLVIA
                 I need to get back to work...
     He closes the door behind them. He kisses her. She's a bit
     surprised - unused to the romance, let alone in her work
     setting.
     He stops and looks at her - was it a bad idea? But she
     smiles and pulls him back, kissing him.

     A box of crackers falls on Saul's head - they burst out
     laughing.

76   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                                76
     Sylvia and Saul walk to school and wait for Anna. Teenagers
     start walking out. Anna appears and notices them. She's
     surprised to see Saul.
                             ANNA
                 Hey.
     Saul waves hello.
                           SYLVIA
                 Saul came by. He's joining us for
                 dinner.
     Anna smiles, trying to be polite.

                           ANNA
                 Can we get pizza?

                           SYLVIA
                 I was thinking of making something
                 with what we have at home.
     Sylvia's response further sinks Anna's mood. The trio walk
     home.

77   INT. SYLVIA'S HOUSE. DAY                                        77
     Sylvia, Saul and Anna are taking lunch in the terrace.
                           ANNA
                 I told you I wanted pizza.
                           SAUL
                 I can go to get pizza. Or I can
                 call them.
     
                                                                58.


                           SYLVIA
                 No. We're not giving in to this
                 behavior.
                           ANNA
                 What behavior? I just wanted pizza.
                           SAUL
                 This is spicy.
                           ANNA
                 Exactly. You know I don't like
                 spicy...
                           SYLVIA
                 Both of you are belittling me as a
                 chef.
     The three of them starts laughing.

78   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT                                   78
     Saul is asleep in front of the TV. Sylvia puts a blanket
     over him.
     Anna and Sylvia are watching a show with the volume low.
                            ANNA
                 I thou ght you weren't working with
                 him anymore.
                           SYLVIA
                 I'm not. I'll be back with Karen
                 on Monday.
                           ANNA
                 I don't get it. Why's he here,
                 then?
                           SYLVIA
                 He's here as a friend.
     They continue watching the TV. Anna is confused.
     The door buzzer sounds.
     Sylvia stands and checks who it is. Saul wakes.
                           ISAAC (O.S)
                 Hi Sylvia. Is Saul there?
                           SYLVIA
                 He is. I'll buzz you.

                                                         59.


Isaac climbs the stairs and enters Sylvia's.
                      ISAAC
            I've been looking all over for you.
Saul sits up.
                      SAUL
            Don't start.
                      ISAAC
            What are you doing here?
                      SAUL
            I came to visit.
                      ISAAC
            You specifically do what I ask you
            not to do.
                      SAUL
            I forgot what you told me not to
            do.
                        ISAAC
            Fuck off.

                        SYLVIA
            Hey!
Sylvia tries to get Isaac to stop shouting, which pisses him
off even more.

                      ISAAC
                (to Sylvia)
            I've been calling you. Why hav en't
            you picked up?
                      SYLVIA
            I haven't looked at my phone.
                      ISAAC
            What is wrong with you??
                      SYLVIA
            Excuse me?
Isaac raises his voice. Anna is scared.
                      ISAAC
            Sara showed me the picture of you
            two.
     
                                                              60.


                            SYLVIA
                  Lower your voice.
     Isaac grabs Saul by the arm.
                           ISAAC
                 Let's go. We'll talk on the way
                 home.
     Saul shakes himself free and walks up to Sylvia.
                           SAUL
                 Would you mind if I stay longer?
                           SYLVIA
                 Of course not.
                           SAUL
                     (to Isaac)
                 Get out.
     Isaac leaves, slamming the door behind him.

79   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - ANNA'S BEDROOM / SYLVIA'S BEDROOM.   79
     NIGHT
     Anna and Sylvia finish putting fresh sheets on Anna's bed.
                            ANNA
                 Goo d night.
                            SAUL
                  Thanks for lending me your room.
     Anna smiles and leaves.
                           SYLVIA
                 Got all you need?
                             SAUL
                 Thanks.
     He smiles.
                             SYLVIA
                 Night.

     Sylvia smiles back, closes the door and heads back to her
     room.
     Anna is already in bed. Sylvia lies down next to her. They
     hug.
     
                                                                61.


     Sylvia turns off the light.

80   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM / ANNA'S BEDROOM.     80
     DAY
     It's early in the morning. Sylvia is up. She wakes Anna.
                           SYLVIA
                 Wake up. It's late.
                             ANNA
                 Okay...
     Anna gets out of bed and goes to her room. She knocks on the
     door.
                             ANNA
                 It's me!
                             SAUL (O.S.)
                 Come in.
     Anna opens the door to find Saul stark naked - just out of
     the shower.
                           SAUL
                 Good morning.
     Anna is stunned, she turn s around and hurries off. Saul
     doesn't understand what just happened - he continues drying
     himself with his towel.
     Sylvia checks in a moment later. She tries to draw Saul's
     attention to the fact that he is naked. He's suddenly
     embarrassed and covers himself with the towel. Sylvia knows
     he didn't mean anything bad by it.
     Sylvia collects Anna's clothes, closes the door and goes to
     her room.
                           ANNA
                 Would it be ok if I stay with
                 Ashley if Saul's staying tonight?
                           SYLVIA
                 He doesn't have to stay...
                           ANNA
                 You like him, he should stay.
                           SYLVIA
                 Okay... you know he doesn't realize
                 the things he does sometimes.
     
                                                             62.


                             ANNA
                 I know.
                           SYLVIA
                 Go take a shower.

     Sylvia walks out.

81   INT. LUCIEN. DAY                                              81

     Sylvia and Saul are looking at the menu in a fancy
     restaurant. The waiter approaches.

                           WAITRESS
                 Welcome, it's been a while.
     Saul nods, and smiles at Sylvia.
                           WAITRESS (cont'd)
                 The usual appetizers?
                           SAUL
                 We'll take a look at the menu,
                 thanks.
     The waiter leaves.
                           SYLVIA
                 What are the usual appetizers?
                           SAUL
                 I have no idea.
     Sylvia can't help but laugh.
                           SYLVIA
                 You do remember the waiter?
     Saul shake his head. They both laugh out loud.

82   INT. LUCIEN. DAY                                              82
     Sylvia comes out of the bathroom and joins Saul at their
     table. They're done eating. The waitress brings the bill.
     Saul gestures that he wants to pay with his smartphone.
                           WAITRESS
                 I'll get the terminal.
                             SYLVIA
                 Thanks.
     
                                                              63.


                           SAUL
                 My pleasure.
     The waitress comes back with the card machine. Sylvia gives
     Saul his card, but the payment is declined.
     They try again: declined.
     Sylvia takes out her card, but Saul won't allow it.
                           WAITRESS
                 Would you like us to check with
                 your bank and see if we can
                 validate the payment?

                           SAUL
                 Yes, please.
     The waitress leaves. Sylvia calls a different WAITER over.
                           SYLVIA
                 Can we have the check, please?
     The waiter takes a moment to come back with the card
     machine. Sylvia's card passes instantly.
                           SAUL
                 Hold onto the receipt. I'm paying
                 you back.
                           SYLVIA
                 Are you crazy?
     They get up and put on their coats. The waiter comes back.
                           WAITRESS
                 I've been told the account is
                 blocked.
                           SAUL
                 He's an asshole.
     They thank the waiter and leave. Sylvia looks worried.

83   EXT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - GARDEN. DAY                               83
     The family is having a picni c. Robert and Mark are passing a
     baseball around. Olivia is grilling. Lucy, Ashley and Anna
     play with the dog, pretending to throw a ball, the dog is
     confused.
     Samantha sits down on the grass. The dog jumps on her. Lucy
     goes to Samantha's rescue.

                                                            64.


                        SAMANTHA
            Anna!
Anna has taken a liking to Samantha - she enjoys spending
time with her. They sit next to each other while Lucy and
Ashley continue playing with the dog.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            You don't drink with friends, do
            you?
                      ANNA
            No. My mom hardly ever lets me go
            out. But I don't like drinking.

                      SAMANTHA
            Does Ashley smoke or just drink
            alcohol?
                      ANNA
            I think she stopped smoking.
                      SAMANTHA
            You're a good girl.
                       ANNA
            Wh y did you let mom drink?
                      SAMANTHA
            You think she asked for permission?
Anna remains quiet, Samantha strokes her hair.
                       SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            Sylvia was a sweet child... Olivia
            was always jealous of her. Your mom
            was my favorite. But when she hit
            her teens she started looking for
            trouble...
                      ANNA
            Did she get along with Grandpa
            better?
                      SAMANTHA
            She didn't.
                      ANNA
            Too bad we never met.
Mark interrupts, handing Anna a hotd og.
     
                                                                65.


84   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                84
     Sylvia and Saul enter the house. She drops her purse on the
     couch. There's tension in the air.
     They enter her bedroom and they start kissing and undressing
     each other and make love in an awkward way.

85   INT. SAUL'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR TO BEDROOM. DAY                   85
     Saul unlocks the front door and enters. Sylvia follows him
     to his bedroom. He takes a suitcase ou t of the closet.
     Sylvia helps him pack.
     Isaac walks in.
                           ISAAC
                 Why are you packing?
     They ignore Isaac and continue packing.
                           ISAAC (cont'd)
                 You are not sufficiently aware of
                 what you're doing to make rational
                 decisions...
                           SAUL
                 Unblock my account! Or I swear I'll
                 kick you out of my house!
     Isaac walks out. Saul and Sylvia continue packing in
     silence. Saul sees the A Whiter Shade of Pale vinyl on his
     chest of draw ers, but decides to leave it there.

86   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                86
     Saul and Sylvia have eaten dinner naked in bed. We see the
     remaining crackers, salmon and cream cheese on a tray.
     Sylvia's phone - it's Anna. She answers, putting Anna on
     loudspeaker.
                           SYLVIA
                 Hi sweetie, how are you?
                           ANNA (V.O.)
                 Hi mom... can I stay over at
                 Ashley's again tonight?

                           SYLVIA
                 I thought we were going to ha ve
                 dinner the three of us...
     
                                                                66.


                           ANNA (V.O.)
                 C'mon mom. Olivia will drive me
                 over tomorrow after lunch.
     Saul looks at Sylvia, convincing her to let Anna stay at her
     cousin's.
                           SYLVIA
                 OK. See you tomorrow then.
     She hangs up.

                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 She is gonna stay at Olivia's
                 again.
     Saul opts to cheer her up.
     Sylvia smiles.
     INSERT: SYLVIA WRITES HER NAME AND INFORMATION DOWN ON A
     CARD.
     Sylvia takes off the old card from Sara's handmade necklace
     and attaches the new one with her address. She hangs it
     round his neck.
                           SYLVIA (cont'd)
                 I have made myself your new
                 emergency contact.
                             SAUL
                 Nice.
     He models his look. They laugh.

87   INT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE. DAY                                         87
     Robert and Olivia watch TV while Mark and Lucy play Twister
     with Samantha.
     We hear Anna and Ashley play with the dog in one of the
     rooms.

     The doorbell rings. Olivia gets up from the couch and opens.
     S he's surprised to see Sylvia and Saul. They walk in - Saul
     carries an ice cream tub.
     Sylvia notices Samantha.
                           SYLVIA
                 Where's Anna?

                                                           67.


Olivia feels caught out. She doesn't know what to say in
order to avoid a fight.
Sylvia's nerves threaten to break under her mother's gaze.
                      SAMANTHA
            Why don't you sit down?
                        SYLVIA
            Anna!
Samantha remains calm.
                      SAMANTHA
            Hello. You must be Saul.
Saul looks but doesn't answer.
Anna comes out of Ashley's room - with Ashley beside her.
                      SYLVIA
            Where did you get that dress?
                      ASHLEY
            Grandma gave it to her.
                       SYLVIA
            You'l l take it off at home. Let's
            go.
Sylvia grabs Anna by the arm and pulls her away. The dog
barks, Lucy calms him down.
                      SAMANTHA
            Anna, tell your mom you want to
            spend time with me.
Sylvia shouts back.

                      SYLVIA
            Don't you go near her!
Samantha stays calm.
                      SAMANTHA
            You'll make her live with a man
            who's mentally ill?
Saul grins, bitterly.
                      SYLVIA
            You protected a pedophile for
            years.

                                                           68.


                      ROBERT
            I will not accept that kind of talk
            in my house.
Sylvia ignores Robert's remark, and continues staring at
Samantha.
                      SAMANTHA
            I hoped you'd finally stop making
            things up after so many years...
Sylvia shuts her eyes - she feels dizzy. She sits down. Anna
looks concerned.
                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
            Stop lying.
Sylvia looks at Olivia. The sisters stare at each other.
                      SYLVIA
            Are you finally going to remember
            or are you going to keep saying
            nothing happened?
Olivia stays quiet.
                      SYLVIA (cont'd)
            You saw us inside his room more
            than once.
                      OLIVIA
            I was eight years old.

                      ANNA
            What happened?

Anna's question goes unanswered.
                        ANNA (cont'd)
            Mom?
                        SYLVIA
            Tell her.
Olivia doesn't say a word.
                      SAMANTHA
            Anna, would you rather live here
            with Olivia?
                      SYLVIA
            I hate you.

                                                      69.


                      SAMANTHA
                (calmly)
            I always loved and took care of
            you, and what do I get in return?
                      SYLVIA
            Tell them how dad used to abuse me
            when I was a little girl.
                      ROBERT
            That's enough.

                      SAMANTHA
            You've been lying since you learned
            to talk. Your sister never gave us
            any problems. You gave us nothing
            but grief - at school, at home.
            Drinking since you were twelve...
            You're the only alcoholic in this
            family.
                      SYLVIA
            Olivia wasn't raped since she was a
            kid.
                      ROBERT
            That's enough. Get out.
                      SAMANTHA
            Is it my fault you're a failure?
Sylvia looks broken - Anna is upset.

                      SAMANTHA (cont'd)
                (to Saul)
            Do you want to be with a sick
            woman?
Saul doesn't respond. He tries to comfort Sylvia.
                      OLIVIA
            Dad used to take her to his room
            and shut the door. He'd say they
            were going to watch a film
            together. But he never let me in.
They all stare back at Olivia, then Samantha.
                      SAMANTHA
            So you remember how they used to
            watch films together?
     
                                                                 70.


                           OLIVIA
                 You knew what was going on in that
                 room.
                           SAMANTHA
                 Then why didn't you say anything?
                           OLIVIA
                 I was confused... I always thought
                 he loved Sylvia more than he loved
                 me. I told you once what I saw and
                 you slapped me.
                           SYLVIA
                 You slapped me every single time I
                 told you I didn't like being with
                 dad.
                           SAMANTHA
                 He never touched you.

     Robert stares at Olivia - she stares back. She looks
     ashamed. A silence settle s in the room.
                           SAUL
                 Let's go home.

     Saul helps Sylvia up.
                           SYLVIA
                 Anna, let's go.
     Anna hurries to grab her stuff. The trio walk out.

88   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT - SYLVIA'S BEDROOM. DAY                   88
     Sylvia is lying down - she looks exhausted. Anna is lying
     next to her, comforting her.
     Saul brings some cookies to Sylvia. The doorbell rings. Saul
     answers.
                             SAUL (O.S.)
                 Yes?
                           OLIVIA
                 It's Olivia.
                           ROBERT
                 We were just hoping to talk to
                 Sylvia.
     
                                                              71.


                           SAUL
                 She is not available right now.
                            ROBERT
                 Oh okay. Please tell her that we're
                 thinking about her and that we'll
                 come back.
     Anna hugs her mother in the bed.

89   INT. SYLVIA'S HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.                             89
     Saul and Anna are washing dishes together. They hear Sylvia
     crying from the bathroom. Saul goes to check on her.

90   INT. SYLVIA'S HOUSE. BATHROOM. DAY                             90
     Saul sits next to Sylvia in the bathtub. She is cryin g and
     hurries to hug Saul. Accidentally she pulls him over and he
     fells into the bathtub.
     They start laughing and kissing.

91   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. DAY                                   91
     The door bell rings. Anna opens the door and finds Olivia.

                           ANNA
                 She is sleeping.
                           OLIVIA
                 That's why I knocked.
                           ANNA
                 Why did you keep talking to
                 Grandma?
                           OLIVIA
                 It's not that simple.
                           ANNA
                 You knew all along and never said
                 anything.
                           OLIVIA
                 I was a child Anna .
                           ANNA
                 That's not an excuse. If I had a
                 sister I would never do that to
                 her.
     
                                                                72.


     Olivia remains quiet.
                           ANNA (cont'd)
                 I don't want to see Samantha ever
                 again. I don't even think I want to
                 talk to you, either.
     Olivia leaves and Anna closes the door behind her.

92   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.                         92

     Sylvia is sleeping in the middle of the night.

93   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                                  93
     Saul wakes up in the middle of the night and tries to go to
     Sylvia's bedroom. He sees the rooms of Sylvia and Anna
     closed and he can't remember which door is the one he is
     looking for.
     Saul sits on a chair, frustrated.

94   INT. ADULT RESIDENCE - MAIN ROOM. DAY                            94
     Sylvia is helping a resident to pick her clothes for the
     day. From the reception, Sylvia is called.

                           SYLVIA
                 I'll be right back, okay?

     Sylvia goes to the reception and finds Karen.
                           KAREN
                 Woodhull hospital called. Saul is
                 there. You need to go.
                           SYLVIA
                 Saul? Is he okay?

                           KAREN
                 I don't know. You will have to go
                 there. Keep me posted.
     Sylvia rushes to the hospital.

95   INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION. DAY                                   95
     Sylvia waits for a receptionist to finish her conversation
     on the phone - and approaches her after she hangs up.
     
                                                              73.


                           SYLVIA
                 Excuse me, I'm looking for Saul
                 Shapiro.
                           HOSPITAL RECEPTIONIST
                 Just a second.
     The receptionist checks her computer.
                           SYLVIA
                 They took him in a few hours ago.

                           HOSPITAL RECEPTIONIST
                 What's your name?

                           SYLVIA
                 Sylvia Sanders.
     The receptionist makes a phone call.
                           HOSPITAL RECEPTIONIST
                 Sylvia Sanders is here... Yes...
                 OK. You can wait over there.

     She points to a bench.
     Sylvia sits. She waits a few moments. Sh e looks up and sees
     Isaac walking towards her - livid. She stands.
                           SYLVIA
                 How is he?
                             ISAAC
                 Go away.
                           SYLVIA
                 Can you at least tell me if he's
                 OK?
                           ISAAC
                 They found him lying unconscious in
                 the street outside you're house.
     Sylvia looks shocked. Isaac stares at her.
     Sylvia tries to think of something to say. She realizes it's
     pointless, and leaves.

96   INT. SYLVIA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT                                 96
     Sylvia can't sleep. She take s her phone from under her
     pillow and dials Saul. He doesn't answer. She tries again
     but it goes straight to voicemail.
      
                                                                  74.


                            SYLVIA
                  Hi. I just want to know if you're

                  accept the things that we cannot
                  change; the courage to change the
                  things we can; and the wisdom to
                  know the difference.
