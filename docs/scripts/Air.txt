INSERT - TV COMMERCIAL

The unmistakable smile of MAGIC JOHNSON - he's holding a
CONVERSE SNEAKER and rapping along to a cheesy jingle.

                    MAGIC JOHNSON
          The Converse Weapon - that's the
          shoe that let Magic do what he was
          born to do!

ISAIH THOMAS.

                    ISAIH THOMAS
          That may be so, but that's not
          all... they let Isaih play like
          he's ten feet tall!

LARRY BIRD. This could be a commercial for the NBA Hall of
Fame.

                    LARRY BIRD
          You already know what they did for
          me. I walked away with the MVP!

"Converse - the official shoe of the NBA!"

EXT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

BEAVERTON, OREGON

Even if you don't know what the modern Nike headquarters
looks like, you can imagine it. A sprawling green campus.
Lots of glass. Lots of money.

An "employee first mentality". Great benefits. Unlimited
vacation (unless you take too much). They match the fuck out
of your 401k.

Now... imagine the exact opposite of that.

TITLE CARD READS: 1984, NIKE WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS

Two buildings. They look more like IRS offices in Iowa than
the headquarters of a sneaker company.

                    STRASSER (V.O.)
          Well... Orwell was right. 1984's
          been a tough year.
                                                         2.


We drift down the hall, passing framed pictures of Olympic
athletes hoisting gold medals, track stars, runners, etc.
Notably absent are pictures of basketball, football, or any
other sport an average American would consider popular.

Until we reach...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

                     STRASSER
           Sales down. Growth down. Ratings
           down. But I know I'm not worried.

ROB STRASSER, VP of Marketing. 6'3, 280 pounds with an extra
helping of shoulders. His red beard a bonfire on his face.

Giving a presentation to...

                     STRASSER (CONT'D)
           How about you guys?

...the bored group that makes up Nike's Basketball Division.
Pencil pushers. Collared shirts. Note pads. Coffee mugs.
Yawns.

                     STRASSER (CONT'D)
           Bids are going in next week. Let's
           run through ideas?

He looks around the room....

Nothing.

                     STRASSER (CONT'D)
           Alright. Olajuwon is off the table.
           #1 pick isn't coming here. We're
           not getting Jordan either. Word is
           he's going Adidas. Maybe Converse
           if they're willing to pay. So...
           same plan as always: we'll identify
           three players, and split the baby.
           We know we're going after Barkley
           and Bowie. Any other ideas?

Pencils TAP. TAP. TAP.

                     STRASSER (CONT'D)
           Anyone?

                     BILL
           I like Melvin Turpin.
                                                         3.


                    STRASSER
          Great. Let's get him on the board.

Strasser writes TURPIN across the board.

                    STRASSER (CONT'D)
              (off dead air)
          Anyone else?

                    TIM
          What about John Stockton?

                    STRASSER
          Interesting. From Gonzaga?

                    TIM
          Yeah.

                    STRASSER
          Alright. Well, let's go into...

                    SONNY (O.S.)
          Why do you like Melvin Turpin?

Everyone at the table turns. Their gazes drifting to the very
back of the room, where we find...

JOHN PAUL VINCENT VACCARO. To make it easy, we'll call him
what everyone else does: SONNY. 45. Short and squat. Italian-
American. A determinism in his eyes, the bags under which
tell us how much sleep he gets (none).

                     SONNY (CONT'D)
          Melvin Turpin. What do you like
          about him?

                    BILL
          Me?

                    SONNY
          You're the one who said you liked
          Melvin Turpin, right? Jim?

                    BILL
          Bill.

                    SONNY
          Bill. Right. Bill the big Melvin
          Turpin fan.

                    BILL
          He made the Final Four last year.
                                                            4.


                     SONNY
           So did forty other players.

                     BILL
           Kentucky puts good players in the
           NBA. I mean, he was the fifth
           pick...

                     SONNY
           Have you watched him?

                     BILL
           Of course, I...

                     SONNY
           So what do you like about his game?

                     BILL
           He's got a good feel for the court.
           Good vision.

                      SONNY
           He only had 33 assists last year,
           which would tell most observers
           otherwise.

                     BILL
           Listen, I...

                     SONNY
           No, actually I agree with you. Mel
           Turpin is going be good.
               (wait for it)
           In Europe, when he's out of the
           league in four years. Maybe we can
           sign him then. We have an office in
           Paris, right? You like Mel Turpin
           because he was the fifth pick in
           the draft. You like him because
           it's an easy answer and no one is
           going to give you shit for saying
           you like the fifth pick in the
           draft.

                     STRASSER
           Alright, alright. Any other ideas?

Silence.

Strasser looks to Sonny, who sticks two fingers up to his
temple. BANG.

                     STRASSER (OVERLAP) (CONT'D)
           What the hell is wrong with you?
                                                            5.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CAFETERIA - DAY

A sea of faces in line for the same slop. Corporate lunch
hour.

Sonny and Strasser sit across from each other. Strasser
already eating what everyone else is in line for.

                    SONNY
          So who are we thinking?

                    STRASSER
          We just sat in a conference room
          for an hour trying to answer that
          exact question.

                    SONNY
          I like Stockton some.

                    STRASSER
          That would have been nice to
          discuss in the meeting. He was
          brought up.

                    SONNY
          I didn't want to discuss it in the
          meeting. I wanted to discuss it
          with you. What happens in there is
          bullshit.

                    STRASSER
          That's because people are scared to
          speak.

                    SONNY
          Why would they be scared?

                    STRASSER
          Because you chew their heads off!

                    SONNY
          I wouldn't do that if they had good
          suggestions. Mel Turpin?

                     STRASSER
          I didn't say Melvin Turpin was a
          good idea.

                    SONNY
          Then why defend it?

                    STRASSER
          Team mindset, Sonny.
                                                         6.


                    SONNY
          I prefer the truth.

Strasser lowers his voice, taking a more serious tone.

                    STRASSER
          We have 250k for three players. How
          do we want to spend it?

                    SONNY
          Can we get more?

                    STRASSER
          No chance. I'd say Barkley is the
          most interesting, the most
          marketable... the round mound of
          rebound. It's there already. We
          don't have to do anything - just
          have to print it on a billboard.

                    SONNY
          What about Jordan?

                    STRASSER
          Converse or Adidas. For sure. I sat
          in Falk's office for three hours
          last month. Just too expensive.

                    SONNY
          Guy never shuts up.
              (pivoting)
          I do like Stockton some.

                    STRASSER
          Gonzaga though...? I don't think
          people even know where that is.

                    SONNY
          I'm not saying it's ideal.

Sonny looks out the window. Gazing through the flat fields
surrounding the office.

                    STRASSER
          Listen, what I said in there? About
          not being worried? I was lying.

                     SONNY
          No shit.

                    STRASSER
          You saw the numbers. One of these
          three needs to be star.
          Otherwise...
                    (MORE)
                                                           7.

                    STRASSER (CONT'D)
          Nike may well be out of the
          basketball business. And we'll be
          out of jobs.

                    SONNY
          I'm out of a job. You'd be fine.
          We're on the brink. It's just a
          matter of time before we hit on the
          right player.

                    STRASSER
          Unfortunately, time is the one
          thing we're short on.

A deep sigh. Strasser stares a hole through the ceiling.

                    STRASSER (CONT'D)
          OK. So, Barkley. Stockton. And
          Bowie.
              (trying to convince
               himself)
          These are good players.

                    SONNY
          Yeah. They are.

                    STRASSER
          Then what's wrong?

                    SONNY
          Just a feeling.

                    STRASSER
          The time for feelings was six
          months ago. Now it's time to pick
          players. Nike needs a basketball
          icon. It's as simple as that. But
          icons are like money... they don't
          grow on trees.

                    SONNY
          Money's made with paper. Paper
          comes from trees.

                    STRASSER
          Yeah, well I...

                    RICHARD
          Excuse me. Mr. Strasser...

He's interrupted by RICHARD, who screams middle management.
Beige green button up with khakis.
                                                         8.


                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
          I... sorry to interrupt you.

                     STRASSER
          That's fine, it's good to see
          you...
              (trying to figure out who
                the hell this is)
          Uh...

                    RICHARD
          I just wanted... could I get some
          time on your calendar next week?
          We've been discussing some
          marketing strategies on the Air
          Sole expansion and I'd love to pick
          your brain on it.

                    STRASSER
          Of course. Just stop by my office
          and we'll get it on the books.

                    RICHARD
          Great. Great! Looking forward to
          it!

Richard walks off. Proud of himself.

                    STRASSER
          I have no idea who that is.
              (off Sonny's laugh)
          You know there was a time I could
          name everyone who worked here?

                    SONNY
          Things change. Places grow.

Strasser looks around the cafeteria. Everyone milling about.
So many people. All going about their day.

                    STRASSER
          I guess so.
              (looking up at the
               counter)
          You want dessert? Sundae bar today.

                    SONNY
          Can't.

                    STRASSER
              (surprised)
          What, you have other plans?
                                                         9.


                    SONNY
          Have a meeting.

                      STRASSER
          With who?

                    SONNY
          The shoe dog.

Off Strasser's raised eyebrows. Shit.


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

PHIL KNIGHT, CEO and FOUNDER of Nike. Orange-red beard and
long hair. He doesn't look like a CEO - he looks like a long
distance runner. A bohemian capitalist.

                      PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny.

Sonny makes the long walk from the door to Phil's massive oak
desk. Picks up a plastic basketball resting on it. Tosses it
up and down.

There's an OREGON DUCKS mini-hoop on the wall. Right next to
the infamous WAFFLE IRON - the one that produced the first
Nike shoe.

                    SONNY
          I'm missing the sundae bar, Phil.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Who's this lunatic that keeps
          skateboarding in the parking lot?

They both look out the window, where there is indeed a MAN
SKATEBOARDING around the parked cars.

He's wearing a leather jacket and a large cowboy hat, both
look designer even from the second floor.

                      SONNY
          No idea.

The SKATEBOARDER jumps OVER the back of a car.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
              (back to business)
          How was the strategy meeting?
                                      10.


          SONNY
Oh, just enlightening.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Do we have a plan in place?

          SONNY
Well, if you ask Strasser, the plan
in place is the plan that's always
been in place. Split our budget in
three, sign three players... and
cross our fingers. Maybe we can try
pressing the Magic Money Button
while we're at it.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Don't fuck around, Sonny. First
quarterly loss in history. I just
had to lay off a quarter of the
fucking company.

          SONNY
There's no escape hatch, Phil. We
need to increase spending.

          PHIL KNIGHT
That's not going to happen.

          SONNY
Is Strasser's number right? 250k?

          PHIL KNIGHT
Yes.

          SONNY
What about five?

          PHIL KNIGHT
No. Profits have dropped, we should
be dropping the budget along with
it. You're lucky to have 250 as is.

          SONNY
It's not enough. We need to invest
more in basketball.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Why? We took four golds at the
Olympics.

          SONNY
No one gives a fuck. That's a
morale boost. Kids don't care about
running.
          (MORE)
                                       11.

          SONNY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, but it's the truth. Not
everyone is you, Phil. Track and
field doesn't sell.

          PHIL KNIGHT
But at least we know what we're
getting with a runner. Their
performance and fame isn't reliant
on the team that's around them.

          SONNY
I know you--

          PHIL KNIGHT
    (cutting him off)
People don't know what you do here.

          SONNY
You know what I do here.

          PHIL KNIGHT
That's not the point. I have a
board to answer to. And guess what
they're asking me about?

          SONNY
The rules of basketball?

          PHIL KNIGHT
You.
    (frustrated)
You don't make shoes, you're a pain
in the ass in meetings, you don't
work normal hours. You're off
running high school tournaments
half the year. So... Sonny... What
the hell do you do?

          SONNY
    (spinning the basketball
     on the desk)
I bring you players. I find
basketball players.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Then where are they? I brought you
in to grow our basketball business
and it's shrunk every year.

          SONNY
I'm telling you, we just need more--
                                                12.


                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I would have hired a parrot if it's
          only job was to ask for more money.
          I've got the board on my ass asking
          why we even need basketball. It's a
          wasted investment.

                    SONNY
          Because basketball is the future.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny, the NBA finals are on tape
          delay. They don't tape delay the
          future.

                    SONNY
          This is why I told you not to go
          public. These things happen when
          you go public.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Investing in basketball is not a
          reason to put off going public.
          It's done now, there's nothing--

                    SONNY
          It's called plateauing. It happens
          to every company. Well, almost
          every company. Every boring company
          for sure. Every company with
          limited aspirations. Every company
          that doesn't see the bigger
          picture. That only cares about the
          P and L statement and the board
          being happy.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Don't use the company's failings to
          mask your own. Personal ambition is
          a danger.

                     SONNY
          The line between personal ambition
          and group success is thinner than
          you think.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          That's what someone who values
          personal ambition would say.

Phil leans back in his chair. Breathes out.

                    PHIL KNIGHT (CONT'D)
          Do you run?
                                                        13.


                    SONNY
          Is this going to lead to some
          Buddhist aphorism I don't want to
          hear?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Do you run?

                    SONNY
              (gesturing to his stomach)
          Phil, look at me.

                     PHIL KNIGHT
          It's painful, it's hard. The act
          itself is a destination. It's
          suffering.

                    SONNY
          There's a thought within the
          Catholic Church that suffering is
          the only true path to salvation.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          And are you willing to suffer?

                     SONNY
          I don't know, Phil, but the longer
          you have me at this desk the more
          I'm thinking the answer is yes.
               (looking up at his shoes)
          So are you going to tell me why you
          run?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Because the alternative is
          stopping.

They're interrupted by PHIL'S SECRETARY, who peeks her head
through the large doors.

                    SECRETARY
          Mr. Knight? Your 1pm...

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Tell them just a moment. Mr.
          Vacarro was just seeing himself
          out. And can you have security
          figure out why there's a cowboy
          skateboarding in our parking lot?

                    SECRETARY
          Of course, sir.

As Sonny exits...
                                                        14.


                       PHIL KNIGHT
             You cannot travel the path until
             you become the path.

                       SONNY
             Don't pull your Namaste bullshit on
             me, Phil.

Sonny finally SHOOTS the plastic basketball.

It misses.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The WHIRRING of a carpet cleaner. Soap and cleaning solution
SPIN.

A uniformed JANITOR nods his head to whatever he's listening
to on his headphones.

He's the only one in the office.

Or so he thinks...


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

You can hardly see Sonny among the MOUNTAINS OF VHS TAPES
stacked all around the office.

Each has a strip of masking tape across it with a player's
name written in sharpie.

He's chewing through tape. Watching STOCKTON. Watching BOWIE.
Watching BARKLEY.

Old standard definition highlights. Sonny replays Stockton
going to the hoop. Forward and backward. Examines his jump
shot. Forward and backward.

Yawns. Leans back in his chair. Looks up at his wall, where
Nike's MISSION STATEMENT is neatly framed. Ten rules. The
commandments.

#1. Our business is change.

#3. Perfect results count - not a perfect process. Break the
rules: fight the law.

Sonny piles a few of the tapes up. Puts them in his bag and
heads out.
                                                        15.


INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Sonny wanders the pale aisles of the grocery store. The wheel
of his plastic red cart squeaking.

He passes boxes of cereal, in all of their neon 80's glory.
Stops to gaze at...

A BOX OF WHEATIES - LARRY BIRD on the cover. He's holding...

CONVERSE SNEAKERS.

                       GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE
          Sir...?

Sonny turns around. An EMPLOYEE waits with a cart full of
milk gallons, ready to stock.

                    GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE (CONT'D)
          Can I help you?

                    SONNY
          No, sorry... just...

                    GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE
          We're closing soon.

                    SONNY
          Got it. Thanks.

She continues rolling down the aisle....

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Hey... do you know where Gonzaga
          is?

                       GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE
          Excuse me?

                    SONNY
          Gonzaga. Do you know where it is?

                    GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE
          ...Switzerland?

                    SONNY
          Never mind. Thanks.

As Sonny makes his way back down the aisle... he catches his
altered reflection in the slightly tinted glass of a freezer.

And what he sees is what he feels... tired and old.
                                                           16.


INT./EXT. SONNY'S CAR - NIGHT

Sonny sits in the front seat of his car. Driving home...

He pulls over. Parked on a suburban street.

He takes a deep breath. Reaches into one of the grocery bags
in the backseat. Takes out a box...

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE ICE CREAM BARS. He tears the box open
and removes one. Rips open the wrapper...

Technicolor pink. Undoubtedly some sort of poisoned food
coloring, but childlike in its artificial wonder.

SONNY SCARFS IT DOWN. Four or five bites, but he eats it so
fast it's hard to tell.

He chews and chews. Like he's racing against someone
invisible sitting shotgun. Finally swallows. And then...

Reaches for another one. Same routine. Rips it open. Devours
it down in just a few bites. Gulps it down. Takes a breath...

Starts his car again. He drives slow. Turns the wheel as we
see...


EXT. VACARRO HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

He was right around the corner from his house. He pulls into
the driveway and steps out of the car.

He rips the strawberry shortcake box into so many pieces,
you'd never know what it was in the first place.

He disposes the pieces in the trash can outside the garage
along with the four uneaten bars.


INT. VACARRO HOUSEHOLD - SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sonny sits in his armchair, his two TV's the only light in
the room.

He's watching tape on one. ESPN on in the background of the
other one.

Close on Sonny's face, bathed in the blue light of the
television. Flickering as we hear the sound of a crowd
CHEERING.

Something on the other TV catches his attention...
                                                          17.


A TENNIS COMMERCIAL, featuring ARTHUR ASHE. Sonny turns up
the volume.

                    ARTHUR ASHE
              (holding up a racket)
          This is the racket I won Wimbledon
          with. And you could've bought it.
          Really.

Sonny digests what he's watching. He turns back to the other
screen.

We can see his wheels spinning as he watches the tape. He
leans in closer.

It's almost otherworldly. A moment of   transcendence that only
comes a few times in one's life. When   everything seems to
click together, if only for a second.   It all makes sense.
When you finally see what you've been   missing this whole
time.

We see the empty VHS case. The tape he's watching. It reads:

JORDAN


INT. STRASSER'S OFFICE - DAY

You can learn who a person is by what they keep on their
desk. Strasser's a lifer. A native Oregonian. The type of guy
who knows that what he's doing can be bullshit, but does it
anyway.

Framed pictures of him with NBA players, standing with his
son at the Finals, the Olympics, etc.

He sits across from an EXECUTIVE, we'll call him RICH. Climb
the corporate ladder long enough and you are.

                    STRASSER
          Unfortunately, our commitment will
          have to come down this year.
          Budgets and all. But that doesn't
          mean...

The door opens. Sonny pokes his head through.

                    STRASSER (CONT'D)
          I'll be done in twenty.

                    SONNY
          I need you done now.
                                                           18.


                    STRASSER
          Sonny.

                    RICH
              (getting up)
          No worries at all. I understand.
          It's the busiest time of year.

                    STRASSER
          Sorry about this. Thanks for
          coming, Rich. We'll follow up.

                    SONNY
              (almost shooing him out)
          Yeah, we'll follow up.

                    STRASSER
          What the hell is--

                    SONNY
          I found the icon tree.

                    STRASSER
          I don't care what you found, we
          have relationships to--

                    SONNY
          It's in North Carolina.

He clicks on the TV. Pushes in a VHS. A beat as it loads
before--

Michael Jordan's game winning shot against Georgetown.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          It's Jordan.

                    STRASSER
          He hits the shot. I've seen it.
          We've all seen it.

                    SONNY
          No. Stop. Don't watch the shot.
          Don't watch Jordan.

                    STRASSER
          You don't want me to watch Jordan.

                    SONNY
          Correct. In fact, watch everything
          except Jordan.
              (as he lets the tape
               continue)
          Look at Dean in the huddle.
                    (MORE)
                                                        19.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Look at how he draws up the play.
              (he lets a little more
               play before pausing the
               tape again)
          That's James Worthy. First overall
          pick, as you know. Another player
          we had no chance at signing.

                     STRASSER
          Correct.

                    SONNY
          So why isn't he taking the shot?
          Why is this skinny freshman from
          Wilmington, North Carolina taking
          the shot?

                    STRASSER
          Because he was open.

                    SONNY
          The play was drawn up that way. No
          one else was taking that shot. It's
          because they saw the same thing I'm
          seeing.

He lets the tape play out. Jordan catches the pass. Seventeen
seconds left. Seventeen feet from the basket. Pulls up for
the jumper. It's good.

Sonny pauses the screen. Close on Jordan's face.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          You can see it in his eyes.

                    STRASSER
          Sonny... There's no way we can...

                    SONNY
          If Nike wants to get serious about
          the basketball business then Nike
          needs to get serious about the
          basketball business.

                    STRASSER
          I... don't know what that's
          supposed to mean.

                    SONNY
          I don't want to sign three players.
          I want to sign one.
                                      20.


          STRASSER
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you high?

          SONNY
No. It all came to me last night.
We can build a shoe line around
him. Just him. Think about it...
the shoe deal has hardly changed
since the beginning of time. Why
are we beholden to this archaic
model? We can tap into something
deeper... the player's identity.

          STRASSER
    (dumbfounded)
You're looking to personify... A
shoe.

          SONNY
Yes! Have you seen that Arthur Ashe
commercial?
    (switching to Arthur Ashe
     voice)
"This is the racket I won Wimbledon
with. And you could've bought it."
What if we do that with a shoe?

          STRASSER
Even if Jordan wanted to come here,
it would cost too much.

          SONNY
That's not true. We have 250k. We
can get him for 250k.

          STRASSER
And what's your genius pitch?

          SONNY
I told you, we can offer him
something that no one else can.

          STRASSER
Which is...?

          SONNY
Nike doesn't have a strong
basketball department.

          STRASSER
    (hands in his face)
Oh, good god.
                                     21.


          SONNY
Think about it. It's what Converse
won't do. They can't upset any of
their players by elevating one
above the other. We can. Converse
has Magic, Bird, Dr. J. But the
sneakers aren't theirs. Every
player wears the same Converse
Weapon... there's only one Jordan.

          STRASSER
Sonny he wore converse in college.
Adidas is the hot commodity. I
mean, god, Spot-Bilt can probably
offer him more money.

          SONNY
That's not--

          STRASSER
He got cut from his High School
team.

          SONNY
Exactly - people missed on him
before, and they're missing on him
again.

          STRASSER
That's an interesting perspective
to take on it. Come on, we have to
be realistic. What happened to
Stockton?

          SONNY
No one knows where Gonzaga is.

          STRASSER
Enough. We're going to distribute
it to three or four players. If
Jordan wants 75k... maybe 100k. We
can discuss. But...

          SONNY
It's the only way. You want an
icon... let's go get a fucking
icon.

          STRASSER
Phil will never go for this.

          SONNY
Let me handle that.
                                                        22.


                    STRASSER
          You really couldn't have brought
          this up yesterday?
              (off Sonny)
          Have you slept?

                    SONNY
          Not really.

                    STRASSER
          Please don't take us on a wild
          goose chase, Sonny. This is too
          important...
              (off Sonny)
          I mean have you even talked to--

He's cut off by a RINGING PHONE.

                    SONNY
          Jordan's agent?

                    STRASSER
          Yes.

                    SONNY
              (calling outside)
          Who's on?

                    SECRETARY
          David Falk.

Strasser shakes his head. Trying not to smile.

                    SONNY
          Coming!

Off Strasser. Worry overtaking. Thinking...


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny sprints into his office, some disheveled papers falling
off his desk as he does. He picks up the phone.

Waiting on the other line, as promised, is...


INT. PROSERV AGENCY - DAVID FALK'S OFFICE - DAY

DAVID FALK, Jordan's agent. Shiny bald head, five figure
pressed suit. The prototype power agent. He came out of womb
negotiating commission structures.
                                      23.


          DAVID FALK
Sonny, Sonny, Sonny. Here comes the
Sonny.

          SONNY
Good morning, Falk.

          DAVID FALK
It's afternoon for those of us in
the real world. Regardless, I've
been waiting to hear from my
favorite Italian in Oregon. I hear
Nike is getting out of the
basketball business.

          SONNY
Who told you that?

          DAVID FALK
You know I have clients in other
sports. I just signed Boomer
Esiason.

          SONNY
You heard wrong. I'm calling
about...
    (taking a deep breath)
Jordan.

          DAVID FALK
    (laughing)
I talked to Strasser about Michael
in June. He's not signing with you.
In fact, he's not taking a meeting
with you.

          SONNY
What do you mean?

          DAVID FALK
A meeting? A group of two, maybe
four to five, executives in a room?
They discuss business? Hear a pitch
from a company? Does any of this
sound familiar? Michael's not going
to be doing that at Nike.

          SONNY
Falk, don't fuck with me here. What
are the bids looking like?

          DAVID FALK
It's not about the money.
                                      24.


          SONNY
Of course it is.

          DAVID FALK
We've decided to stretch the
envelope. It's not just about
dollar value. We want to hear what
each company can do to promote
Michael.

          SONNY
OK, we're thinking along the same
lines then. All I'm asking for is a
meeting.

          DAVID FALK
He's the #3 pick in the league,
Sonny. #3 picks don't wear Nikes.

          SONNY
Just get us in the room. What's one
more flight? One more day?

          DAVID FALK
I have one directive from Michael:
do whatever it takes to get me with
Adidas.

          SONNY
You're fucking with me.

          DAVID FALK
Frankly, Sonny, I'm too busy to
fuck with you. Off the record -
even though UNC's a Converse
school, Michael wore Adidas during
practice. He would put on Converse
just before the game started. The
second the final buzzer sounded?
Adidas' back on.

            SONNY
Bullshit.

          DAVID FALK
On my word. Ask Dean.

          SONNY
I thought that was off the record.

          DAVID FALK
I didn't say you had to tell him
where you heard it.
          (MORE)
                                                        25.

                    DAVID FALK (CONT'D)
          And trust me, Converse isn't happy
          about it either. I've already seen
          a mockup of their presentation.
          It's something. Three words: state
          of the art.

                    SONNY
          That's four words. But I get it.

Falk counting. 1. 2. 3. Fuck.

                    DAVID FALK
          Now, if you're interested in
          submitting an offer that I can use
          to drive up Adidas' price, by all
          means... go ahead. Makes my job
          easier.

                    SONNY
          What are they offering?

                    DAVID FALK
          Offers aren't in yet. But we're
          anticipating anywhere between 200
          and 250.

Sonny holds his hand over the receiver. Silently mouths FUCK.

                    DAVID FALK (CONT'D)
          Why? What's your budget?

                    SONNY
          We can be... competitive.

                    DAVID FALK
          That's annually. Not total comp.

                     SONNY
          I'm aware.
              (takes a breath)
          Come on, it's a shit show over at
          Adidas. Has been ever since Adolf
          croaked.

                    DAVID FALK
          Adi, Sonny. He went by Adi.

                    SONNY
          His name was Adolf. That's not my
          fault.

                    DAVID FALK
          He was a good man.
                                                        26.


                    SONNY
          Well, he died all the same. Wife's
          running the show now?

                    DAVID FALK
          We're meeting with the whole
          family.

                    SONNY
          She's rich, has five heirs, and
          probably isn't long for this earth.
          Do you think her spawns are
          thinking about shoe endorsements or
          succession plans?
              (off silence)
          When's his Adidas meeting?

                    DAVID FALK
          What time is it?

                    SONNY
          11:02.

                    DAVID FALK
          71 hours and 58-minutes from now.

                    SONNY
          OK. Let me get back to you.

Sonny hangs up. Bites his lip. Paces back to...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - STRASSER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny slips back in. Strasser is watching Jordan tape. Re-
evaluating. Looking for whatever it is that Sonny sees.

                    STRASSER
          What'd he say?

                    SONNY
          We have a great shot. He'd been
          waiting for my call for weeks.

                    STRASSER
              (rolling his eyes)
          How much?

                    SONNY
          I already told you. Our entire
          budget.
                                                        27.


                    STRASSER
          Jesus, Sonny. You're really going
          to take this to Phil?

                      SONNY
          Yes.

                      STRASSER
          When?

                    SONNY
          After my lunch.

                    STRASSER
          What lunch?

                    SONNY
          The one I'm going to.

                      STRASSER
          With who?

                    SONNY
          The man who already passed on
          Jordan.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Some upscale bullshit restaurant that was the hardest
reservation in Portland for two years before going out of
business. Sonny sits across from...

STU INMAN, General Manager of the Portland Trailblazers.
Sleight, the frame of a former power-forward, which he was. A
pressed collar lapping over a well-fitting sweater.

A WAITER stands over them, ready for their orders.

                    STU INMAN
          Two steaks. Medium rare?

                    SONNY
          No red meat.

                    STU INMAN
          You're off red meat?

                    SONNY
          Yeah, for my heart.

                    STU INMAN
          Bullshit. You don't have a heart.
                                      28.


          SONNY
Chopped salad please. With grilled
chicken.

            WAITER
Yes, sir.

          SONNY
Thanks for meeting last minute.

          STU INMAN
I hear Nike is getting out of the
basketball business.

          SONNY
Why is everyo...
    (catches himself)

          STU INMAN
Honestly, it makes sense. I never
saw how you could compete with the
big boys. Not enough capital.

          SONNY
We have capital.

          STU INMAN
Yes. Just not enough. Gossip aside,
you strike me as a Stockton-guy.

          SONNY
Why's that?

          STU INMAN
Because Gonzaga is risky and you
like rolling the dice.

          SONNY
He's a hell of a player. I would
have taken him ten picks sooner,
for sure.

            STU INMAN
But...?

          SONNY
But nothing. I like him.

          STU INMAN
Who's on your mind?

          SONNY
Why'd you pass on Jordan?
                                      29.


          STU INMAN
Oh, come on, Sonny. You're not
signing Jordan.

          SONNY
But what do you think of him? As a
player?

          STU INMAN
I think he's a good player. Have
you talked to Falk?

          SONNY
Then why didn't you draft him?

          STU INMAN
My advice would be to leave it
alone. The Bulls are a mess. He's
not going to be in the playoffs for
years.

           SONNY
A player can transcend his
situation.

          STU INMAN
Sure, but this isn't a situation.
It's a mess. And the playoffs are
where the money is. You know that.
You want to pay top dollar for a
player that's going to be on
national television once a year?
Twice with the all star game if
you're lucky?

          SONNY
I mean, you watched the tape?

          STU INMAN
Of course we did. We knew he'd be
there at #2. We have Drexler and
Paxson. We didn't need another
guard - we needed a center.

          SONNY
I don't think you can draft based
on needs that high... you have to
draft on talent.

          STU INMAN
He's not going to be better than
Drexler.
    (frustrated)
What do you see in Jordan?
                                                        30.


                    SONNY
          It's in his eyes.

                    STU INMAN
          I see two brown eyes. 60% of the
          world has brown eyes, Sonny. It's
          the most common eye color in the
          world.

                    SONNY
          It's not the color. It's something
          else.

                    STU INMAN
          So you came all the way down here
          to tell me you didn't like our
          draft pick?
              (off Sonny)
          What, you think I'm going to be
          remembered as the man who passed on
          Michael Jordan? Come on, Sonny.
          Players come and go. No one's
          remembered for just one player.

Close on Sonny. His eyes tell us differently.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY

Sonny paces up to Phil's office, where Phil's secretary sits
expectantly.

                    PHIL'S SECRETARY
          They're already in there.

                    SONNY
          Who?

                    PHIL'S SECRETARY
          Phil said he had a meeting with you
          and Mr. Strasser?

Sonny shakes his head as he opens the door to...


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

Strasser sits across the desk from Phil. An empty chair next
to him - like it was waiting for Sonny.

Strasser turns to him. Mouths "sorry". Sonny can only shake
his head.
                                      31.


          PHIL KNIGHT
I hear you had lunch plans.

            SONNY
Hi, Phil.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Before we get into things, let me
just say this: no.

          SONNY
Let me explain.

            PHIL KNIGHT
No.

          SONNY
You told me something the day you
hired me: We're not in the shoe
business, we're in the
entertainment business.
    (off Phil)
This is entertainment. Michael
Jordan is the guy we've been
waiting for.

          PHIL KNIGHT
You both said the exact same thing
about Bobby Jones and Artis
Gilmore.

          SONNY
If perfection is the goal than we
were doomed from the start. You
can't expect us to be right every
time

          PHIL KNIGHT
How about some of the time?

          SONNY
That's part of gambling. You don't
win every hand. It's time to change
our strategy.

          PHIL KNIGHT
This is a business, Sonny, not a
craps table. We don't have
unlimited checks to write.

          SONNY
I'm not asking for unlimited, I'm
asking for 250.
                                      32.


          PHIL KNIGHT
You want to pay him $250,000?

          SONNY
Yes. More if possible.

          PHIL KNIGHT
A rookie. Who hasn't set foot on an
NBA court yet?

          SONNY
That's the literal definition of a
rookie, yes.

          PHIL KNIGHT
A player who was cut from his High
School team?

           SONNY
Yes.

           PHIL KNIGHT
Magic Johnson doesn't even have a
shoe line.

           SONNY
Exactly.

          PHIL KNIGHT
    (thinking it over)
No. I can't justify paying one
player that much...

          STRASSER
Phil, we're thinking this has a
chance to--

          SONNY
Let me put it like this: I'm
willing to bet my career on Michael
Jordan. If this doesn't work... I'm
gone. No questions asked.

          PHIL KNIGHT
This isn't the time for theatrics.

          SONNY
I'll put it in writing. No
severance. Gone like I was never
here at all.

           PHIL KNIGHT
Why?
                                                        33.


                    SONNY
          Because you asked me what I do
          here... and this is what I do here.
          I find players. And I feel it right
          now. I wish I could explain it
          better... I just know. We can't
          split the baby. Not this time. When
          you were slinging sneakers out of
          the trunk of your Plymouth Valiant
          under the name Blue Ribbon
          Sports... I know you envisioned
          more than this. You had grander
          dreams. Strasser's in the cafeteria
          booking meetings with people he
          doesn't even know... we can't
          afford to play it safe. Not this
          time. Not now.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
              (begrudgingly)
          What's the competition?

                    STRASSER
          The Germans.

                                                   CUT TO:


EXT. ADIDAS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Even if you don't know what the modern Adidas headquarters
looks like, you can imagine it.

But you don't need to. Because in 1984, this place already
looks like it will in 2020.

A monolithic building, an almost cartoonish Soviet-style
fortress, topped by a neon blue trefoil spinning in the fog.
The finest German glass reflecting water shimmering.

The Adidas Museum: Spikes worn by Jesse Owens at the 1936
Olympics in Berlin. Boxing shoes worn by Muhammad Ali. Stan
Smith's Stan Smiths, and the pair of soccer cleats that would
become known as the Copa Mundial.


INT. ADIDAS HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The Adidas braintrust sits around a conference table, each
with a folder and neat stack of paper in front of them.

KATHE DASSLER - the matriarch. She's not in good health, but
is running the company anyway.
                                                        34.


HORST DASSLER - her son, controlling everything behind the
scenes (or trying to), round face anchored by a square jaw.

FOUR DAUGHTERS - they all look vaguely similar, only twelve
years between the youngest and the oldest. Almost like each
one was cloned three years apart and now they're growing up
in order.

JOHN O'NEIL - Adidas' Head of Operations in the States, sits
at the end of the very long table.

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          I know the last thing we want to be
          discussing is business.

They all turn to a giant portrait of ADOLF "ADI" DASSLER.
Founder of the company, recently deceased, his presence still
looming from the grave.

                    JOHN O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          I can only imagine the grief.

                    KATHE DASSLER
          As Adi would say... We must go on.

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          Yes. We must. And we have an
          incredible opportunity in front of
          us.

They all flip to the first page and we see...

JORDAN.

                    JOHN O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          We believe we have a real chance.

                       HORST DASSLER
          Very good.

                    PHIL KNIGHT (V.O.)
          Anyone else?

                       STRASSER (V.O.)
          Well...


EXT. CONVERSE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

NORTH READING, MASSACHUSETTS. A towering brick artifice. A
refurbished factory. CONVERSE HQ. Their STAR logo imprinted
on the building.
                                                          35.


"CONVERSE ALL STAR" in big letters. Coincidentally, or
perhaps not, it describes the type of players they endorse.


INT. CONVERSE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

JOHN O'NEIL - CEO and JOE DEAN - VP of Basketball. Converse's
top execs. The guys who signed Bird and Magic.

Their big board. OLAJUWON is already circled. The top name on
the list. They don't fuck around.

Continue down the list. BOWIE is already crossed out. The
next name is unavoidable: JORDAN.

They look at each other. Nod.


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          So everyone's in.

                    SONNY
          Yeah... everyone's in.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Can we get a meeting?

                    STRASSER
          You're signing off on this?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I didn't say that. I said can we
          get a meeting?

                                                     CUT TO:

                    DAVID FALK
          No.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sonny's on with Falk. The twisted phone cord wrapped around
his clenched his fist. Trying to play it cool.

INTERCUT with Falk in his office. It's late.

                    SONNY
          Falk. Come on.
                                      36.


          DAVID FALK
Submit an offer and then we can
talk meeting.

          SONNY
I just had Phil give the exact
opposite order.

          DAVID FALK
Chicken or the egg?

          SONNY
    (biting his lip before...)
The offer is 250k.

           DAVID FALK
No shit.

           SONNY
Shit.

          DAVID FALK
Can you get me that in writing?

          SONNY
Do you need it?

          DAVID FALK
It's not an offer if it's not in
writing. It's a long ass plane
ride. Why can't you get a base on
the east coast like a normal
company?

          SONNY
They love it here.

          DAVID FALK
Well, great, I'm glad they're
happy.

          SONNY
How're the parents?

          DAVID FALK
Good family. No funny business. No
clingers. Smart as hell. You're not
going to pull any bullshit on them.
They don't want to be sold to.

          SONNY
Are they home now? In Carolina?
                                      37.


           DAVID FALK
Why?

          SONNY
I'm just asking.

          DAVID FALK
You don't need to call them. That'd
be extremely unprofessional.

          SONNY
So is outright refusing a meeting.

          DAVID FALK
That's just business.

          SONNY
Let me ask you something. Why does
Michael want Adidas?

           DAVID FALK
Sonny.

          SONNY
Why does Michael want Adidas?

          DAVID FALK
Because he likes their tracksuits.

           SONNY
Come on.

          DAVID FALK
I'm serious.

          SONNY
We will give him every tracksuit
he's ever wanted.

          DAVID FALK
He's a kid. He's not thinking about
what he will have, he's thinking
about what he doesn't have right
now.

          SONNY
How'd you sign him? He could have
gone with anyone. Pro Serv? What'd
you see in him?

          DAVID FALK
The exact same things you're
seeing. Let me make some calls.
          (MORE)
                                                        38.

                    DAVID FALK (CONT'D)
          I'll have an answer for you
          tomorrow at the latest.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Sonny walks into the conference room. Strasser leans back in
his chair and takes a deep breath.

                    STRASSER
          What's the word?

                    SONNY
          Holding pattern. But I think we
          have a shot.

                    STRASSER
          Did he ask for an offer?

                    SONNY
          I'm thinking of reaching out to the
          parents.

                    STRASSER
          I don't know if--

                    SONNY
          And 250k. That was the offer I gave
          him.

                    STRASSER
          Jesus Christ, Sonny.

                    SONNY
          It will get them in the door.

                    STRASSER
          No shit. But it's not real.

                    SONNY
          Should I call the parents?

Sonny SNEEZES and COUGHS. Strasser looks at him. "You OK?"

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Just got a cold.

                    STRASSER
          Sounds like a nasty one.

                    SONNY
          Thank you, Doctor. Any
          recommendations?
                                      39.


          STRASSER
More sleep.

          SONNY
Something realistic.

             STRASSER
Any sleep.

          SONNY
Why does Michael want Adidas?

          STRASSER
They have cache. They have style.
They're cool.

          SONNY
It's the track suits. That's what
Falk told me. How do we fight
against track suits?

          STRASSER
It's not the track suits. Track
suits aren't just track suits.

          SONNY
There has to be something. I feel
like if I could just talk to
them...

          STRASSER
Don't chase the rabbit, Sonny. It's
not worth it.

          SONNY
This isn't a fucking rabbit,
Strass.

          STRASSER
How do you know? You're halfway
down the fucking rabbit hole
telling me we're not chasing
rabbits.

          SONNY
You run at all?

          STRASSER
Run? God no. Why?

          SONNY
Phil asked me if I did.
                                      40.


          STRASSER
Phil asked you if you run?

          SONNY
Yeah.

          STRASSER
So what? Everything between you and
him is a fucking game of code.

          SONNY
So I'm asking you the same thing.

          STRASSER
No. No, I don't run.

          SONNY
Why?

          STRASSER
Look at me.

          SONNY
That was my answer. But you don't
think it's funny? We work at a
running company and we don't run.

          STRASSER
Doctors are the people most likely
to smoke. Cops break the laws.
Therapists have the highest rates
of divorce. No, I don't think it's
weird.
    (sighs)
You know my birthday's in two days?
What should I ask for?

          SONNY
The fuck do I care? A blowjob.

          STRASSER
    (laughing)
What about a boat?

          SONNY
A boat? What the fuck are you going
to do with a boat?

          STRASSER
I don't know. Fuck it, maybe I'll
just go for a run.
    (getting up)
Alright, I gotta get outta here.
          (MORE)
                                                        41.

                       STRASSER (CONT'D)
                 (off Sonny, not getting
                  up)
             You coming?

                       SONNY
             No, gonna stick around for a little
             bit longer. Work on some strategy.

                       STRASSER
             Got some sleep you crazy mother
             fucker. And Sonny?
                 (off Sonny)
             Whatever you do, don't call the
             parents.

Close on Sonny as the door clicks shut.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sonny picks up the phone. The DIAL TONE sounds increasingly
loud in the silence of the office.

He hangs up. Leans back in his chair. Thinking.

Picks the phone up again. Dials.

                       OPERATOR
             Operator, how can I connect you?

                       SONNY
             Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan
             residence... James Jordan?

                       OPERATOR
             One moment sir.
                 (after a long beat)
             I'm putting you through now.

                       SONNY
             Thanks.

A LONG BEAT. The silence is potent. We're waiting to hear
that first RING.

But before we do...

Sonny hangs up.

Looks out the window. The moon shines bright over the only
car in the parking lot. His.

TIME LAPSE
                                                           42.


We hold on the car as the sun rises above it. A new day.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - SONNY'S OFFICE - MORNING

We're angled on the door to Sonny's office. It OPENS.
STRASSER pokes his head in. Raises his eyebrow. We see why...

Sonny's not in the office. Strasser looks back to the
secretary.

                    STRASSER
          Where is he?

                    SECRETARY
          He hasn't been in this morning.

                    STRASSER
          Is he home? He was feeling sick
          last night.

                    SECRETARY
          I haven't heard from him.

                    STRASSER
              (looking out the window)
          What the hell... his car is in the
          parking lot.

A faint RING from down the hall. Strasser looks back. It's
his office phone.

He hustles back. From his form, it's quite clear why he
hasn't taken up running.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - STRASSER'S OFFICE - MORNING

RING. RIN---

He grabs the phone off the cradle. Just in time.

                    STRASSER
          Hello?

                    SONNY
          Strass.

                    STRASSER
          Where the hell are you?

Great question. We're tight on Sonny, so we know as little as
Strasser. But it's clear he's at an indoor PAYPHONE.
                                                43.


                    SONNY
          Listen, I don't have much time.

                    STRASSER
          Sonny what the hell is going on?

                    SONNY
          I need you to hold Phil off. Just
          for another day. I... I made up my
          mind.

                    STRASSER
          What? On what?

                       SONNY
          I'm going.

                    STRASSER
          Going where??

                    SONNY
          To Carolina.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL--


INT. PDX TERMINAL - DAY

SONNY IS IN THE AIRPORT.

                    STRASSER
          Sonny, no... this is... What
          happened to a phone call?

                    SONNY
          You were right. Calling out of the
          blue would have been
          unprofessional.

                    STRASSER
          So you're going to show up at their
          door??

                    SONNY
          I gotta run. I'm about to miss
          boarding.

                       STRASSER
          Good!

                    SONNY
          If anyone asks I'm sick.
                                                          44.


                    STRASSER
          You are sick.

                    SONNY
          I'll be back for your birthday,
          don't worry.

The line clicks dead. Strasser looks like he's seen a ghost.

AND OVER THE SOUND OF AN ENGINE WE...

                                                   SMASH TO:

TITLE CARD READS: WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA


EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - DAY

Sonny exits the sliding glass doors of the airport.

He looks around. This is a whole other world. A humid August
afternoon. The muggy air of a long Indian Summer.


EXT. RENTAL CAR PARKING LOT - DAY

Sonny walks across the rental lot, trailed by...

                    RENTAL CAR EMPLOYEE
          Sorry, sir! We don't usually get
          walkups.

A RENTAL CAR EMPLOYEE, a pimpled college-grad, bad hair gel
and even worse cologne. His Southern accent is so strong it
sounds fake.

                    SONNY
          This is really all you have?

They both turn to see Sonny's rental:

A MINIVAN. Toyota's 1984 "The Van". It looks like a divorced
dad-mobile crossed with an oversized taxi-van. Truly hideous.

                    RENTAL CAR EMPLOYEE
          I kind of like it. My step-dad
          drives one.


INT./EXT. - SONNY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY

THE MINIVAN, NOW ON THE HIGHWAY. Cruising down the wooded
freeways of North Carolina. U.S. Highway 117. The Blue Ridge
Mountains off in the distant horizon.
                                                        45.


Sonny has a MAP folded out across the entire dashboard. He
looks at the highway exit signs. Examines the map closer.

                    SONNY
          Where in the hell...

Continues down the highway....


INT./EXT. - SONNY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY

He pulls up to a gravel driveway. The low hum of cicadas in
the air.

And gazes upon...


EXT. JORDAN RESIDENCE - DAY

4647 Gordon Road.

A middle-class, split-level house. It's surrounded by woods
on all sides. Patches of shade provide the only respite from
the hot summer sun.

A CAR sits in the front lawn, its hood propped up. As Sonny
approaches, he sees...

JAMES JORDAN, 48, thin mustache, wrench in hand, twisting
something on the engine.

He sticks his tongue out as he concentrates on the inner-
workings of the machine, a habit passed on from his
grandfather.

He finally hears Sonny's footsteps on the gravel. Looks up
and sees the VAN.

                    JAMES JORDAN
          Hell of a ride you got there. Can I
          help you?

                    SONNY
          Sorry to bother you... I'm looking
          for the Jordans.

                    JAMES JORDAN
          Well, you're in the right place.

                    SONNY
          You must be James.
              (reaching out his hand)
          Sonny Vaccaro. I'm with Nike.
                                                        46.


                    JAMES JORDAN
          Oh, here we go.

                       DELORIS JORDAN (O.S.)
          Who is it?

They both turn to see...

DELORIS JORDAN, 43, bobbed hair, thin frame, small
intelligent eyes.

                    SONNY
          Mrs. Jordan. My name's Sonny
          Vaccaro. I'm here with Nike.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          I believe that Mr. Falk made it
          clear that we weren't interested.

                    SONNY
          Yes, I was told not to call.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Do you typically make a habit of
          showing up at people's front doors
          if they don't answer the phone?

                    SONNY
          Only if I feel I have no other
          choice.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          We do have an answering machine.

                    SONNY
          It may be the worst of all my
          faults, and, trust me, there are
          many, but... I don't like to take
          no for an answer. And I believe
          Michael should be endorsed by
          someone with that same mindset.

A long beat as both Jordans consider. Sonny looks back and
forth between James and Deloris. Does he have a chance?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Well, come back and take a seat Mr.
          Vaccaro.

Yes. He smiles.

                    SONNY
          Please... call me Sonny.
                                                        47.


EXT. JORDAN RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - DAY

Sonny sits alone at a table in the forested backyard.
Waiting. He stares deep into the trees.

Deloris emerges from the back door. Notices Sonny looking at
the trees.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Five generations of Jordan have
          lived and died in this forest by
          the highway. Been here since the
          Civil War. Some of these cypress-
          tupelos trees are 800-years-old.

                    SONNY
          This place, it seems... personal.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Well, every history is deeply
          personal, Mr. Vacarro.
              (takes a breath and looks
               at him)
          It's quite presumptuous of you to
          show up at our door.
              (but....)
          But I believe that saying you want
          something is fine and well, a good
          start, but doing something about it
          is what really counts.

                    SONNY
          Is he... here?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          He is. But you don't need to see
          him.

Sonny looks to the house. Michael Jordan is in there. Like a
ghost. You can't see them, but you can always feel them.

                    DELORIS JORDAN (CONT'D)
          How'd you get that name? Sonny.

                    SONNY
          My mother had trouble bearing
          children. Went through two
          miscarriages. Bad ones. And when it
          finally happened... I wasn't easy
          either. Delivery took almost twenty-
          four hours. She said all she saw
          looking up into that hot bright
          light in the hospital room was the
          sun.
                    (MORE)
                                      48.

          SONNY (CONT'D)
She said it was the first thing
that came to mind when she saw my
face. The sun. Sonny.

          DELORIS JORDAN
And is she still with us?

             SONNY
She's not.

          DELORIS JORDAN
I'm sorry to hear that.

          SONNY
It's OK. It was... a long time ago.

          DELORIS JORDAN
And your father?

          SONNY
Worked in the steel mills. Long
days. Long nights sometimes. Hard
life. But he raised us the best he
could.

          DELORIS JORDAN
I find it honorable. To give your
life for your family's. You give
and you give until you have nothing
left to give. Then you give some
more. But it's worth it.

          SONNY
You're good at this. Somehow we're
talking about my parents instead of
you.

          DELORIS JORDAN
Well, I've had practice. There's no
doubt about that. You do
understand, Mr. Vaccaro, that
Michael's intention is to sign with
Adidas. With Converse as a second
option.

          SONNY
I do. And, respectfully, I think
that would be a mistake. Listen...
here's what I want to tell you:
take the Converse and Adidas
meetings. I'll tell you exactly
what they're going to say to you.
What they're going to sell you. And
if I'm wrong...
          (MORE)
                                                49.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          then don't take the Nike meeting.
          But, if I'm right... you and
          Michael come.

Deloris smiles. Not explicitly agreeing.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
              (mock businessman voice)
          Mrs. Jordan, it's a pleasure to
          meet you.
              (back to Sonny voice)
          This is Converse by the way. He'll
          have his hair gelled up like an
          asshole, excuse my French. I'm
          guessing a red tie, for the Bulls.
          Rolex for sure.
              (back to mock voice)
          We sure do appreciate you making
          the long trip out here. You look
          beautiful today, Mrs. Jordan. I've
          seen a lot of basketball, and the
          feeling I get when I see Michael
          play... there are only a few other
          players that gave me that feeling.
          And those players are here at
          Converse... they're the best of the
          best. It's that simple. Magic
          Johnson. Larry Bird. Michael
          Jordan. Those names all belong in
          the same sentence. And they belong
          at Converse.
              (back to Sonny voice)
          Now, here's the important part. I
          want you to ask them a question.
          Will you do that for me?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          It depends on what the question is,
          Mr. Vacarro.

                     SONNY
          How will Michael stand out when
          he's next to the best players in
          the world? How will he be
          different?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          And what will they say?

                    SONNY
          That he'll be amongst hall of
          famers and that's enough.
                                                50.


                       DELORIS JORDAN
          And is it?

                    SONNY
          You tell me what you think your son
          is capable of.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          And what about the Adidas meeting?
          Michael's top choice is Adidas.

Sonny thinks about it for a moment.

                    SONNY
              (a different mock
               businessman voice)
          Mrs. Jordan, welcome to...

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          You can just tell me.

                    SONNY
              (shaken a little, giving a
               thin smile)
          Here's what they'll tell you: we
          have the best shoes. Plain and
          simple. You're not going to see
          another style like this. All
          leather. Converse isn't cool.
          Michael, you're the next
          generation. You don't want to be
          grouped in with Magic and Bird.
          They're on the way out. You want to
          stand apart.
              (takes a breath)
          Just to clarify - this is now me
          talking not Adidas. They're not
          wrong. I get why Michael is
          interested in them. But...

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          And what should I ask them?

                    SONNY
          Ask them who's in charge of the
          company. Who has the final say?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          And what will they say?

                    SONNY
          Well, I think four different people
          in that room will give you four
          different answers.
                                                         51.


                     DELORIS JORDAN
          Very well.
              (she takes a sip of her
               drink)
          And, finally... the most important
          question.
              (off Sonny, who's unsure)
          What should I ask you?

Sonny takes a breath. Thinks about. Looks her in the eye.

                    SONNY
          Ask me why I'm in Wilmington, North
          Carolina.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Why are you in Wilmington, North
          Carolina?

                    SONNY
          Because I believe in greatness. I'd
          travel anywhere for it. New York,
          Beaverton, the moon... or
          Wilmington, North Carolina.

Deloris doesn't tip her hand. Her poker face could take her
far in Vegas. Close on Sonny. Did he get her?

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Well, Mr. Vacarro, thank you for
          coming. It was very kind of you to
          make the trip all the way out here.

                       SONNY
          Of course.

They get up from the table. Walk back up the driveway,
towards the mouth of the property.

JAMES JORDAN closes the hood on the car. Tries the engine. It
starts. He smiles. A job well-done.

Sonny SWATS away a WASP as he gets close to the van.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          They're everywhere here. Michael
          and his brother shot up a nest just
          over there when they were young.
          Hundreds of these wasps flew out -
          stingers at the ready. The boys had
          so many welts. Everywhere. It took
          weeks to heal. Thought they might
          miss some of the season.
                                                         52.


                    SONNY
          But they healed.

                     DELORIS JORDAN
          That's the truth. I believe that,
          you know... life is all about what
          we do with our pain.
              (as Sonny arrives at the
                van)
          Goodbye, Mr. Vacarro. And good
          luck.

Sonny wipes a layer of sweat off his forehead. Nods as he
gets into the front seat. He turns the key to start the car
and...

It SPUTTERS.

Tries again. SPUTTERS.

                    SONNY
              (under his breath)
          Shit.
              (looking to the Jordans)
          Just takes a second.

Deloris and James look back. Nodding.

He tries once more. And...

The engine sputters to life. Barely.

Close on the Jordans as the car drifts away...


EXT. CAROLINA HIGHWAY - DAY

Sonny's back on the 117. He gazes out the window. Cemeteries
and industrial parks. Spanish moss hangs from the trees.

The afternoon sun hangs high, just beginning it's long
descent into night.

Sonny takes an exit. Into a suburban neighborhood. He glides
past cookie cutter homes. Finally parks the car at a curb.


EXT. EMSLEY A. LANEY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

A big blue sign welcomes him to EMSLEY A LANEY HIGH SCHOOL -
home of the Buccaneers.

CONGRATS SENIORS 84 - GO BUCS spelled out crookedly.
                                                           53.


INT. EMSLEY A. LANEY HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Sonny wanders the halls. The metal lockers. The art projects.
The trophy cases.

As he drifts past blue and yellow classroom doors, Sonny's
ears perk up, like a dog hearing a distant echo...

The sound of basketballs dribbling against a gym floor.

He presses his way through the wooden doors at the end of the
hall to...


INT. EMSLEY A. LANEY HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY

It's every high school gym you've ever seen. You can smell
it. The aging wooden bleachers, the laundered gym uniforms,
the stale floor.

THE BASKETBALL TEAM scrimmages up and down the court. Looks
to be the JV Squad. All the players lanky and uncoordinated
in their adolescence.

COACH POP HERRING. Tall and slender, his thin black mustache
a shade darker than his skin, stands in the center of the
court, the field general for these boys.

                    POP HERRING
          Pass the ball, Stevens! Man, if I
          was half as good as you think you
          are then I'd be in the god damn
          league.

Sonny smiles as he watches the team run through drills. This
is the game at its purest. Before the complications. Before
money. Before you're told you can't play anymore.

It's just the game. An orange ball going through a hoop.

Pop blows his whistle. Looks at Sonny in the stands. He's
casual. Like he's used to strangers showing up in his gym.

                    POP HERRING (CONT'D)
          Alright, fellas. That's good for
          today. We got two-a-days tomorrow.
          8am.

                    SONNY
          Coach Herring?

                    POP HERRING
          Can I help you?
                                                        54.


                    SONNY
          Yes, I think you can. I wanted to
          talk to you about...

Pop rolls his eyes. He's heard this question a hundred times.

                    POP HERRING
          I already told them I'm not doing
          any interviews about Michael. No
          journalists.

                    SONNY
          Well, I'm not a journalist. My
          name's Sonny Vacarro. I'm with
          Nike.

                    POP HERRING
          Nike? You come with some free
          shoes?

                    SONNY
          No, but I'm sure we could arrange
          that.

                    POP HERRING
          You came all the way out here and
          didn't bring free shoes?

                    SONNY
          It was a last minute trip.

                    POP HERRING
          Michael's favorite shoes are his
          Adidas. You know that already?

                    SONNY
          I do.

                    POP HERRING
          You got five minutes.


INT. EMSLEY A. LANEY HIGH SCHOOL - POP'S OFFICE - DAY

You can learn who a person is by what they keep on their
desk. Pop has seen it all. Been through Carolina wars. The
walls are littered with framed photos, shelves with trophies.

                    POP HERRING
          I know why you're here.

                    SONNY
          You didn't even know who I was.
                                      55.


          POP HERRING
I don't need to know who you are to
know what you're doing here.
    (a beat)
You want to know why I cut Michael
Jordan.

          SONNY
I think that's simplifying the
matter, but...

          POP HERRING
Good. Because I'm all about simple.
We complicate simple things all too
often for no damn reason. People
like the narrative... Michael
Jordan cut from his high school
basketball team. But you're a smart
guy. You're an ad man. You know why
people like that story. Because it
means Michael Jordan is a human,
just like them. They like the story
because they can see themselves in
it. If Michael Jordan got cut and
made it... then I can fail and
still make it. But that's just a
story to sell shoes. The truth
is... Michael was always going to
be great. He was already great. You
could tell. And that was the
problem. He knew he was good.
Nah... we saw his talent. But he
was too young. So we put him on JV
so he could grow... so he could
play more. Thought it might light a
fire. Which it did. When people
tell that story... the story that
Michael Jordan was cut from his
high school basketball team... what
they fail to mention is he was back
on Varsity eight months later.

          SONNY
What did Michael say when you cut
him?

           POP
What do you think? He said he was
quitting basketball.
    (laughing)
But that's how he is - takes
everything personally. But it makes
him work harder. That's what makes
him great.
           (MORE)
                                                        56.

                    POP (CONT'D)
              (leaning back in his
               chair)
          So, listen. I just told you why you
          were here... But let me phrase the
          question this way... what are you
          looking for here? What are you
          trying to find?

                    SONNY
          I don't know.

                    POP
          Confirmation?

                      SONNY
          Could be.

                    POP
          Your five minutes were up two
          minutes ago. But let me just say
          this: confirmation's a dangerous
          thing to go searching for. You
          already know Michael's good. That
          he's special. You don't need me to
          tell you that. You don't need
          anyone to tell you that. So what
          are you here for? Just so the man
          who cut Michael Jordan could look
          you in the eye and tell you that
          what you're doing is right?

                    SONNY
          I guess so.

                    POP
          Then here you go: I'm the man who
          cut Michael Jordan. And what you're
          doing is right.

Sonny nods. Takes in what Pop is saying. A moment of shared
silence.

                    POP (CONT'D)
          Free shoes really wouldn't have
          hurt though.


INT./EXT. RENTAL CAR - EVENING

Sonny's VAN drifts down the highway... gliding back towards
the airport. He looks into the trees that surround the road.
                                                         57.


A Southern night begins to come alive with the low
disembodied drone of insect life. A thin layer of mist
drifting through the trees.

Time moves differently in the woods.


EXT. RENTAL CAR PARKING LOT - EVENING

Sonny pulls the VAN back into the parking lot. Who's waiting
but...

The same employee. Sonny gives a salute as he drops off the
keys.


INT. PLANE - NIGHT

A FLIGHT ATTENDANT rolls the beverage cart down the aisle.
Taking orders. Looks at Sonny.

                       FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Peanuts?

                       SONNY
          No thanks.

                       FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Drink?

                    SONNY
          Ginger ale please. No ice.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Here you go...

                    SONNY
          You know what? I'll take the
          peanuts. Changed my mind.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
              (smiling)
          No problem.

She reaches back into the cart and hands him said peanuts.

Attached to the bag is A PAIR OF PLASTIC CAPTAIN'S WINGS.
Sonny takes them off. Turns the wings in his hands. The gold
plastic shining. Something about it...

He drops them into the front pocket of his shirt. Leans back.
Looks out the window.
                                                         58.


Rolling clouds against the purple twilight. Like stock
footage of heaven.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - MORNING

The sun's rising over HQ. Sonny's in the office before
everyone else. Car still in the parking lot. He hasn't gone
home.

Those same eyes open. Tap. Tap. Tap. Waiting by the phone.

RING. RING.

                    DAVID FALK
          You have a lot of balls, you know
          that? What the fuck is wrong with
          you? You show up at the house?

                    SONNY
          Well, you said it would be
          unprofessional to call.

                    DAVID FALK
              (sighs)
          What the hell did you say to her?

                    SONNY
          That she should find Michael a new
          agent.

                    DAVID FALK
          How's Tuesday?

                      SONNY
          For?

                    DAVID FALK
          They're coming to Beaverton. Don't
          make me ask twice.

Sonny covers the receiver. PUMPS HIS FIST.

                    DAVID FALK (CONT'D)
          And don't get ahead of yourself.
          Michael's not going to be excited
          to be there. I get the sense that
          Mom's making him go.

                      SONNY
          I get it.

                    DAVID FALK
          I hope you're ready, Sonny.
                                                        59.


Sonny looks out the window, across the vast expanse of Oregon
woods.

Is he ready? He doesn't have time to think about it.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY

Strasser walks down the hall, coming in for the morning. He
passes Sonny's office. Looks in. Empty.

He shakes his head. Continues down the hall to his office.
Opens his the door to find...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - STRASSER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny sitting at his desk.

                    STRASSER
          Jesus fucking christ.

                    SONNY
          Pack some pajamas tomorrow. We're
          not leaving the office.

                    STRASSER
          Tomorrow's Saturday.

                     SONNY
          Michael Jordan's coming to
          Beaverton.

                       STRASSER
          Holy shit.

                    SONNY
          Also, we need to get some shoes to
          Pop Herring.

                    STRASSER
          To who? Sonny, Phil hasn't approved
          anything.

                    SONNY
          Let me worry about that. Now that
          it's official... I thought we could
          go see Pete.

Strasser shakes his head. Can't help but to smile. Game on.
                                                        60.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - ELEVATOR - DAY

They shuffle into the elevator. Sonny presses the "B" below
"1" and "G". The elevator churns to life and heads...

Down.

Down.

Further down.

DING. The doors open to...


INT. NIKE SHOE LAB - DAY

THE LAB. A shoe head's dream. Computers everywhere. State of
the art (for 1984). Sonny and Strasser snake their way back
to the desk of...

PETER MOORE, LEAD DESIGNER. Peter, 29, is a wizard. A mad
scientist. His laboratory just happens to be in a basement in
Beaverton.

He's prematurely balding, a thin ring of hair all that's left
above his sharp jaunt cheeks. He turns in his swivel chair.

                    PETER MOORE
          Suits?? Down in the cave? To what
          do I owe the honor?

                    SONNY
          We need a shoe.

                    PETER MOORE
          I would assume as much.

                    SONNY
          Ideally the most beautiful shoes
          you've ever seen.

                    PETER MOORE
          OK, easy enough.

                    SONNY
          We're going up against Converse and
          Adidas.

                     PETER MOORE
          Even easier. Gentlemen... step into
          my office.
                                                          61.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - SHOE LAB - DESIGN ROOM - DAY

Sonny and Strasser trail behind Pete as he sits at the end of
a long table. Shoe designs pinned all over the walls.

                    SONNY
          It has to be individual. Think of
          it like this - Converse are plain
          shoes, right? Nothing much to them.
          Every player wears the same shoe.
          The only thing that changes is the
          color. The difference with this one
          is that instead of having the
          athlete wear one of our shoes,
          we're going to create the shoe
          around the athlete.

                    PETER MOORE
          OK, I see where you're going. The
          shoe has to speak to an individual.
          Yet it needs to be marketable to a
          mass audience.
              (thinking)
          Tinker will have some ideas. In
          fact, he should be in by now...

                       SONNY
          Who?

                       PETER MOORE
          Tinker.

                    SONNY
          Who the fuck is Tinker?

As the words leave his mouth, we hear...

A SKATEBOARD.

                       TINKER HATFIELD (O.S.)
          Am I late?

The Cowboy. From the parking lot. Same designer jacket.
Different designer hat. TINKER HATFIELD.

                    PETER MOORE
          You haven't met?

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          No, sir.
              (extending his hand)
          The pleasure is mine.
                                                62.


                    SONNY
          Tinker?

                    PETER MOORE
          Started two weeks ago. He's a
          wizard.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          You're too kind, Mr. Moore.

                    SONNY
          You're from the parking lot.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          Well, I do have a home.

                    SONNY
          Phil sent security to get you.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          Yeah, I talked them out of it.

                    SONNY
              (shaking his head - who
               the hell is this guy?)
          Well, I was just telling Pete that
          we need to create the most
          beautiful sneakers on the planet.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          OK. Easy enough. Form or function?

                    SONNY
          Uh...

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          Something can be beautiful or it
          can be pragmatic. Rarely both. And
          even then, the balance is never
          perfect.

                    SONNY
          Let's go for form then. At least to
          start.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          Beauty over brains. You know what
          they say - poetry only makes the
          world bearable, it's engineering
          that gets us to the moon.

Sonny's BEEPER starts to sound.
                                                        63.


                    SONNY
          Fuck, I'm late.
              (looking to Pete and
               Tinker)
          Take the day to start. We'll check
          in tomorrow.

                    PETER MOORE
          Tomorrow's Saturday...

                    SONNY
              (beginning to head out)
          And the day after is Sunday.

                    PETER MOORE
          Sonny.
              (Sonny turns)
          Who's the player? For the shoe?

                    SONNY
          Michael Jordan.

                    PETER MOORE
          Jesus Christ.

Pete's jaw on the floor. Mouth agape as the elevator doors
slide shut in front of Sonny and Strasser.


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny sits across from Phil, who preemptively reaches for the
PLASTIC BASKETBALL on his desk. He moves it away from Sonny,
placing it on the windowsill behind him.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          So, I hear we have a meeting on
          Tuesday.

                    SONNY
          We need a firm offer.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          And your suggestion is...

                    SONNY
          Our entire budget. 250 this year.
          1.5 million over five years.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny, that's just irresponsible.
                                      64.


          SONNY
It's not. Converse will offer 100
at least. The Germans could match
250 easily.

          PHIL KNIGHT
You really think we can buy him?

           SONNY
No. We need to do more. But it
starts with the money. It always
does. The right amount of money can
get you in good with many people.
But the special ones? The special
ones are the ones that you can't
buy.
     (deep breath)
I want to give him a percentage of
revenue.

          PHIL KNIGHT
No. What are you talking about? No
player has that deal.

           SONNY
Exactly.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Sonny, why him? Magic Johnson,
Larry Bird... they don't have that.

          SONNY
The game is changing. That's their
agents' fault. We can get out ahead
of this.

          PHIL KNIGHT
You told me the same thing when
convincing me to give away shoes to
colleges.

          SONNY
The principle still stands: we
can't pay college players, we can't
pay to endorse them, so we give the
shoes directly to the school
because the media is well worth the
cost of a few dozen shoes.

          PHIL KNIGHT
We're paying to do so.

          SONNY
It's working!
                                      65.


          PHIL KNIGHT
Theoretical value that can't
actually be measured.

          SONNY
What was my first idea? A high
school all-star game. Pretty soon,
every shoe company in the world is
holding their own branded all-star
game. You think the Adidas Classic
just appeared out of thin air? That
was my idea and I have zero equity
in it. I'm giving away my ideas for
free. This place used to value
ideas. It's been a while since that
was true.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Stop seeking attention for
yourself. Self is the enemy. The
self does not exist. Self is a
mirage, a fever dream. To truly
know the self is to forget the
self.

          SONNY
Again, if I wanted a meditation
retreat, I'd go sign the Dalai
Lama. Half these kids, probably
more, don't pan out. There are a
thousand reasons why. Don't have
the work ethic. Don't have the
confidence. The mental fortitude.
Their priorities are in other
places. There's no math formula.
That's the point. There's no
science to life. Some people
succeed, others fail. All I can
fucking do is give you my
recommendation. And this is the
strongest one I've ever had.

          PHIL KNIGHT
Why are you pressing this? What are
you trying to prove?

          SONNY
That I'm right! That I'm right, god
dammit! And that I care. That's the
only reason I do what I do. And I'm
not going to fucking apologize that
I care more than rest of you.
          (MORE)
                                                66.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          And, by the way, people have been
          trying to do exactly what you're
          doing to me for the last twenty-two
          years.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Which is what?

                    SONNY
          Telling me that they don't know
          what the fuck it is I do.
              (worked up, breathing
               heavy)
          How much of life is being in the
          right place at the right time? The
          thing about that moment? You don't
          get to choose when and where it
          happens. All you can do is
          recognize it when it's here. You
          don't choose the time... the time
          chooses you. So here it is: we're
          in the right place and it's the
          right time. Now it's just a
          question of what the fuck we're
          going to do with that opportunity.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          You know they teach that linear
          thinking is nothing but a delusion,
          one of the many that keep us
          unhappy. Reality is nonlinear. No
          future. No past. All is now.

                    SONNY
          Which is why we need to act... now.

He looks up to the WAFFLE IRON on the wall.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Do you want to be the guy that was
          great at selling shoes he found in
          Japan or do you want to be someone
          who changes the world? You can be a
          household name in the apparel
          industry or you can be a household
          name full stop.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny, enough.

                    SONNY
          I, mean, hey, it will be great
          speaking at sales seminars the rest
          of your life.
                    (MORE)
                                                67.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          It's a good living, who could fault
          you? But you want more. I know you
          want more because I want more. And
          if I want more for a company I
          didn't even fucking start then I
          sure as hell know that you want
          more.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Tell me if I'm wrong.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I'm trying to have faith.

                    SONNY
          And what are you doubting?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          The opposite of faith is not doubt
          but certainty. And you're too
          certain.

                    SONNY
          There are hills I'm willing to die
          on.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Give me the weekend. We can always
          cancel on Monday. You don't need a
          firm offer to prep the rest of the
          meeting.

                    SONNY
          It wouldn't hurt.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          You know the first time I met you I
          thought you were in the mob.

                    SONNY
          Phil, I have connections with men
          who wear tacky suits, but they're
          basketball coaches - not mobsters.
          I just want to win. Whether that
          makes me the godfather or not is up
          to you. But we can still make
          Jordan an offer he can't refuse.

Close on Phil. Thinking.
                                                           68.


EXT. CONVERSE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A LIMOUSINE pulls up right in front of the gaping glass doors
of Converse HQ.

Falk steps out first. He looks up at the big CONVERSE logo.
Smiles a shark's smile.

                    DAVID FALK
          Here we are.

The Jordan family gets out of the car. Deloris followed by
James. They turn and wait for Michael to step out. Two long
legs emerge from the car... but we don't see Michael's face.

Waiting for them is... JOHN O'NEIL. He has his hair gelled up
like an asshole. Red tie (for the Bulls). Rolex heavy on his
wrist.

Next to him is JOE DEAN, VP of Marketing.

                    JOHN O'NEIL
              (extending his hand)
          Mrs. Jordan, it's a pleasure to
          meet you. We sure do appreciate you
          making the long trip out here.


INT. CONVERSE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The lights dimmed in a conference room. Everyone sitting
around the table.

Even though everyone in the room is looking at him. We still
can't see Michael Jordan.

The same CONVERSE COMMERCIAL we saw at the beginning is just
finishing.

                    LARRY BIRD
          You already know what they did for
          me. I walked away with the MVP!

"Converse - the official shoe of the NBA!"

The lights go up...

                    JOE DEAN
          I've seen a lot of basketball,    and
          the feeling I get when I see
          Michael play... there are only    a
          few other players that gave me    that
          feeling. And those players are    here
          at Converse...
                    (MORE)
                                                69.

                    JOE DEAN (CONT'D)
          they're the best of the best. It's
          that simple. Magic Johnson. Larry
          Bird. Michael Jordan. Those names
          all belong in the same sentence.
          And they belong at Converse.

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          Michael, we're going to treat you
          like our superstars. Before you
          even step onto an NBA court.

                    DAVID FALK
          We're looking for a shoe that holds
          appeal beyond the basketball court.

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          What could hold more appeal than
          the shoe worn by the best players
          in the game? Every kid wants to
          wear what the stars wear.

Head nods. Fair point.

                    JAMES JORDAN
          What's coming down the pipeline?
          What's the new shoe for Michael
          going to be?

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          If I may... tradition and history
          are paramount at Converse. How does
          the saying go? Don't fix something
          that's not broken.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          You have an impressive roster. The
          best three players in the league in
          Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and
          Julius Erving. But the other way to
          look at that is... the best Michael
          will be with you is number four. No
          matter what he does. How do we know
          that you're going to put Michael
          above them?

Looks around the room. Above them?

                    JOHN O'NEIL
          Well... frankly, ma'am... we're
          talking about Magic Johnson and
          Larry Bird here.
                                                        70.


                    JAMES JORDAN
          Right, so how is he going to stand
          out when you have Bird and Magic?

                    JOE DEAN
          He's going to play like them. He's
          going to be mentioned in the same
          sentence as them. What could be
          better than that?

Off Deloris and James... searching for an answer. Posters of
Magic and Bird behind them. Almost towering.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - SHOE LAB - DESIGN ROOM - DAY

Sonny and Strasser flip through designs. Nods of approval.
Setting certain ones aside.

Pete and Tinker watch them carefully. Waiting for any
indication on their work. Did they get it?

Sonny finally sets the papers down. Looks up.

                    SONNY
          What can we do to make it special?

No.

                    PETER MOORE
          What's missing?

                    SONNY
          That's the million and a half
          dollar question.
              (thinking)
          I think they're too bland. There's
          too much white - not enough color.
          Can we get some more red in there?

                    PETER MOORE
          If we're going by the book they
          literally can't have any more
          red...

                    STRASSER
          Is that true? What's the actual
          rule?

                    PETER MOORE
          51 percent rule. Majority of the
          shoe has to be white. NBA is
          extremely strict about it. They'll
          fine him.
                                                71.


                    SONNY
          The NBA will fine him...

                       STRASSER
          Yes.

                       PETER MOORE
          So no red.

They all turn to Sonny. Still thinking.

                       STRASSER
          Sonny?

                    SONNY
          What about more red.

                    STRASSER
          You just said they'd fine him.

                       SONNY
          Exactly.

                    STRASSER
              (not following)
          And... that's a good thing?

                    SONNY
          What if we just pay the fines? It's
          only, what, 5k per game? That's
          nothing. We can make a commercial
          out of it. It will make headlines.
          They're going to fine us for being
          too colorful.

                       STRASSER
          Huh.

                    PETER MOORE
          OK, we'll go more red. At least to
          start.

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          I like the way you think.

                    SONNY
              (looking at Tinker)
          You know, I was so caught up on
          your first name, that it didn't
          occur to me that your last name
          sounded familiar. You're not... an
          actual Hatfield, are you? Not like
          the Hatfield and the McCoys...
                                                           72.


                    TINKER HATFIELD
          My Grandfather shot Mccoy. Does
          that make me an "actual" Hatfield?

Sonny shakes his head. Holy shit.

                    SONNY
          He teach you to design shoes, too?

                    TINKER HATFIELD
          No. He taught me to ask questions.

Something catches Peter's eye...

                    PETER MOORE
          Let me see those?

                    SONNY
          What?

Moore reaches across the table and into Sonny's shirt
pocket...

THE PILOT WINGS FROM WHEN SONNY FLEW TO CAROLINA.

He turns the plastic in his hand before resting it right in
the center of his palm. And now, it's impossible not to see
the image that's running through Moore's mind...

The center of the wings... a perfect circle... it could
fit...

A basketball.

                    PETER MOORE
          OK, gents, give us another day. I
          think we're close.


EXT. PORTLAND ROAD - DAY

Phil Knight walks out from his house. Dressed in running
clothes - Nike shirt, shorts, and shoes. 80's fashion.

Stretching. Fingers to toes. Rotating his ankles. Clockwise
and counter.

A light layer of fog drifting in. Almost mystical.

Why is it so difficult to get started?

Breathe in. Breathe out.

Go.
                                                        73.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sonny and Strasser wander the dark hallways. Weekend at the
office. The entire building seemingly empty.

                    STRASSER
          How are you, me, and Pete the only
          ones here on a Saturday?

                    SONNY
          Here's the real question: why do we
          divide the week into seven days?
          All the other calendar units come
          from astronomical cycles. A year is
          the time it takes the earth to
          orbit the sun once. Months are one
          full moon cycle. Days are one
          rotation of the earth. But... a
          week? You can't even divide 365 by
          7. It's a prime number. It has no
          correlation to anything.

                    STRASSER
          I don't know.

                    SONNY
          So not wanting to work on a
          Saturday is just as arbitrary as
          Saturday even existing in the first
          place.

They pass a window overlooking the CAFETERIA. Sonny looks out
on the wide expanse of tables and stacked trays. It seems
even bigger when empty.

                    STRASSER
          If this doesn't work... Our jobs
          are gone. Our checks are gone.

                    SONNY
          My job is gone. Phil will keep you.
          Worst case you can just go work for
          Adidas or Converse.

                    STRASSER
          My family is here.

                    SONNY
          Where's here? Beaverton?

                      STRASSER
          Portland.
                                                           74.


                     SONNY
          You have geographic inferiority
          complex. If Oregon is famous for
          anything it's an old trail and
          dysentery.

                    STRASSER
          It's American history.

                    SONNY
          It was just a dirt road, Strass.
          Same as all the others.

                       STRASSER
          It's home.

                    SONNY
          Home's an illusion. Just like your
          job and your security. They're
          words we invented so we could sleep
          better at night. Besides... I'm the
          one who has to worry. What I do...
          you can't put it on a resume.
          Adidas would hire you in a second.
          Me? Not so much.

                    STRASSER
          Who wants a resume? You want to
          dress in nice suits like the rest
          of us? Sit at tables and discuss
          bullshit?

They arrive back to...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM

Sonny sits down. Strasser paces to the window. Looks out
across the wide campus. The parking lot. The forest.

                    STRASSER
          I never imagined this is what we
          would become. It feels impossible.

                    SONNY
          The amoeba never imagined it would
          evolve into a frog. And that frog
          never imagined it would sing. You
          can draw a line from the beginning
          of time to right now. And it all
          feels impossible.
                                                        75.


                    STRASSER
          The thing is... I don't know if I'm
          proud or depressed as shit. Because
          we got to where we wanted. But it
          doesn't feel like I thought it
          would. Like it was supposed to. It
          hasn't solved any of the other
          problems.

                    SONNY
          You know the phrase "meaningful
          work" didn't even exist until ten
          years ago? Used to be a given that
          work was miserable but we did it
          because we had to. The point is:
          it's not supposed to solve anything
          else.

                    STRASSER
          I guess not. But they tell you it
          will.

                    SONNY
          The problem is believing them. Let
          this play out, Strass. Stop
          worrying so god damned much. We're
          going to change the paradigm with
          these.

                    STRASSER
          I mean I'd love to believe that.
          But it's just a shoe. And he's just
          a player.

                    SONNY
          A shoe is always just shoe until
          someone steps into it.

Sonny removes a small square BOX. It's bright pink. He slides
it across the table to Strasser, who opens it to reveal...

A CUPCAKE. A single candle in the top.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Happy birthday, Strass.

Sonny reaches into his pocket for a LIGHTER. Snaps a flame to
life.

                    STRASSER
          How old is this?

                    SONNY
          It's younger than you.
                                                          76.


Strasser shakes his head. Smiles. Blows out the candle.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          What'd you wish for?

                    STRASSER
          I'm not using my wish on you.

                    PETER MOORE (O.S.)
          Hey... Sonny?

Peter leans against the door.

                    PETER MOORE (CONT'D)
          We're ready.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - SHOE LAB - DAY

Sonny and Strasser follow Moore into the lab, Strasser still
carrying his cupcake. Tinker is straddled across a chair.

                    PETER MOORE
          It's your birthday?

                    STRASSER
          Yes. And don't ask the next
          question.

                    PETER MOORE
          Well... Here it is.

And for the first time, we see...

THE AIR JORDAN 1's. They're beautiful. One-of-a-kind.

High-cut. The color blocking giving the appearance that its
made of individual pieces.

The Nike swoosh is displayed prominently, and toward the top
sits the Air Jordan logo, in the shape of the plastic pilot
wings. The shoes look at once timeless and like they've been
sent from the future.

On the bottom: AIR SOLES - made up of concentric circles,
like ripples in a pond.

                    SONNY
          Wow.

                    STRASSER
          Yeah... wow.
                                               77.


                    TINKER HATFIELD
          It has the logic of water. It's
          natural. Like the shoe was always
          here. Before any of us. Like it
          always existed.

                    SONNY
          Let's get prototypes processed
          immediately.

                     TINKER HATFIELD
              (sounds like his mouth is
               full)
          When is he coming again? Tuesday?

They turn to see...

Tinker's eating the cupcake.

                    TINKER HATFIELD (CONT'D)
          This is really good.


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny back across Phil's desk.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          You were here all weekend?

                    SONNY
          Yeah. To be honest with you, we
          were the only ones.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Well, it's a big company, Sonny.
          We're far past the days of needing
          everyone to work through the
          weekend.

                    SONNY
          I asked Strasser about that.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          And what did he say?

                    SONNY
          That this place doesn't feel like
          it used to.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          He's right.
              (a beat)
          So what would you name it?
                                                78.


                       SONNY
          Name what?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Our Michael Jordan Line.

                    SONNY
          You're implying that we're going to
          have a Michael Jordan line.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          If we're going to make him the
          offer we're planning to make him
          then we damm well better have a
          Michael Jordan Line.

                    SONNY
          So we're good?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          We're good.

                    SONNY
          Full budget?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Full budget.

                    SONNY
          How'd you come to that solution?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I went for a run.


INT. STRASSER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny comes blazing into Strasser's office.

                    SONNY
          We need a title. For the line.

                    STRASSER
          You talk to Phil?

                    SONNY
          We need a title.

He looks at Strasser. And that says it all.

                    STRASSER
          Wow. OK. I mean I thought we'd
          just keep it simple? Michael
          Jordan.
                                                        79.


                    RICHARD (O.S.)
          We're signing Michael Jordan?

Sonny and Strasser both turn immediately, heads on a swivel,
to see...

RICHARD - the guy who approached Strasser in the cafeteria.
Standing at the door like he has his hand in the cookie jar.

                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
          We had that meeting scheduled...
          About the air sole expansion?

                    SONNY
          We're not signing Michael Jordan.

                    RICHARD
          No, of course not. I figured you
          were talking about... uh, the other
          Michael Jordan.

                     STRASSER
          Listen...
              (trying to remember his
               name)
          Could we reschedule? I'm sorry.

                    RICHARD
          No, that's totally fine. I... OK.

He nods and leaves the office. Sonny and Strasser get back to
the designs. Until...

RICHARD PEEKS HIS HEAD BACK IN.

                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
          Just... speaking strictly
          hypothetically here... because
          we're not signing Michael Jordan...
          but if we're going to be using air
          soles in all the shoes... what
          about... Air Jordan?

Sonny and Strasser look at each other right away. That's it.

                    JOHN FISHER (PRELAP)
          We have the best shoes. Plain and
          simple.
                                                           80.


INT. ADIDAS HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The ADIDAS meeting is in full swing. Deloris, James, and
Michael sitting at the end of the table from the Adidas
execs.

And there's a lot of them. John Fisher and his team along
with the entire Dassler family. A small army.

We still don't see Michael's face.

                    HORST DASSLER
          Michael, you're the next
          generation. You don't want to be
          grouped in with Magic and Bird.
          They're on the way out. You want to
          stand apart.

They show Michael SHOE PROTOTYPES.

                    JOHN FISHER
          You're not going to see another
          style like this. All leather.
          Converse aren't cool any more.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          What color could the shoes be?

                    JOHN FISHER
          Well, the NBA has rules on that.
          But there are always alternate
          versions we could create.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          What about black shoes? Michael's
          favorite colors are black and red.

                    JOHN FISHER
          Well, Michael, we're a family
          company. Black shoes... could send
          the wrong idea. Not to mention...
          black is banned in the NBA. You'd
          get fined every game for wearing
          those shoes.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          There are a lot of people at this
          table. Who makes the final
          decision?

Everyone at the table looks around. And in that split-
second... we already know...
                                                        81.


                    JOHN FISHER
          Well, unfortunately, the family is
          dealing with a great loss. Not only
          a father, but a founder. Kathe is
          calling the shots.

                    KATHE DASSLER
          Yes, that's right.

                    HORST DASSLER
          It is collaborative though.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Collaborative?

                    JOHN FISHER
          Well, hang on there...
          collaborative may not be the right
          description.

                    HORST DASSLER
          No, that's what it is. A group
          decision.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Sonny sits with Strasser, Phil, and Pete. Meeting prep. The
night before.

                    SONNY
          People make the most important
          decisions in a matter of seconds.
          Research shows that on a blind
          date, you know within five seconds
          whether there will be a second
          date. That's it. Walk in the
          restaurant. See the other person.
          You know. That means we have five
          seconds to make sure Michael Jordan
          wants a second date.

                    STRASSER
          So people do judge books by their
          cover.

                    SONNY
          Of course they do. That doesn't
          mean it's the only factor. But it's
          the most important one.

                    STRASSER
          Are you saying I should wear my
          nicest suit tomorrow?
                                                        82.


                    SONNY
          If it makes you confident, wear it.
              (moving on)
          Phil, you're going to come in seven
          minutes after the meeting starts.

                    STRASSER
          Shouldn't Phil be there from the
          beginning...?

                    SONNY
          No. That looks desperate. Phil has
          a million things going on. But
          that's not apparent unless he has
          to step in late. Then it really
          seems like he's taking time out of
          his day.

Everyone looks towards Phil. Waiting for his opinion. Phil
takes a breath. Sighs.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          He's right.

Sonny keeps going. He knew it.

                    SONNY
          Let's print and bind the shoe
          designs.

                      PETER MOORE
          How many?

                      SONNY
          One.

                      PETER MOORE
          Really?

                     SONNY
          Yup. Just one. You diminish the
          value the second you have
          multiples.

Strasser nods. He's right. Again.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
              (looking at the designs)
          I thought the NBA had a rule on
          color?

                    SONNY
          They do. We're going to pay the
          fines. At least at first.
                    (MORE)
                                                        83.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          See how the NBA responds. The press
          will cover it. It's free
          advertising.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Theoretical value can't be
          measured...

                    SONNY
          Come on, you have a soft spot for
          iconoclasts. You can't deny that.
          He aligns with your rebellious
          ethos.

Phil gives a thin smile. He's not denying it.

                     SONNY (CONT'D)
          Everyone wants to be a part of the
          revolution. Doesn't matter so much
          where or what it is. People want to
          feel like they're breaking the
          rules. Because it's exciting. It's
          not the same old thing. Every bored
          teenager is going to be asking
          their parents for $65 because they
          feel like they're breaking the
          rules when they're wearing the
          shoes. Like they're making a
          statement.

                     STRASSER
          I like it.
              (looking around)
          What else? We have a video.

                    SONNY
          Do we have to show it?

                    STRASSER
          Marketing put good time into it.

Strasser and Peter get up. Sonny sits still. Phil lingers
behind with him.

                       PHIL KNIGHT
          You ready?

                    SONNY
          I think so.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          You think so?
                                                         84.


                    SONNY
          No future. No past. All is now.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Buddhist bullshit.
              (looks at the clock)
          I'll see you in fourteen hours and
          seven minutes.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sonny still at his desk late. Moonlight visible through the
half-drawn blinds. Strasser passes by the doorway, peeks in.

                       SONNY
          What's up?

                    STRASSER
          You should go home. Get some sleep.
          There's nothing more you can do at
          this point.

                    SONNY
          How are you feeling?

                    STRASSER
          Same way I did seventy-two hours
          ago. I think you're fucking crazy.
          And I'm now 35 instead of 34.

                    SONNY
          Other than that?

                    STRASSER
          Other than that, I think we're
          good. Don't kill yourself over
          this. Many have died for less.

                    SONNY
          And some for more.

                    STRASSER
              (under a thin smile)
          And some for more.

Hold on Strasser. Waiting to say something. Searching.

                       STRASSER (CONT'D)
          Sonny?

                       SONNY
          Yeah.
                                                          85.


                       STRASSER
             You don't have to be right.
                 (Off Sonny, biting his
                  lip)
             You don't have to be. It's OK if
             you're not.

                       SONNY
             Stop with that shit, Strasser.

                       STRASSER
             Say it. You don't have to be right.

                       SONNY
             No.

                       STRASSER
             You don't have to be right.
                 (a beat)
             You don't have to be right.

He brings Sonny in. Wraps his arms around him.

                       STRASSER (CONT'D)
             You've done enough.


TIME LAPSE

The sun rises over Nike.

It's just another day. Another Tuesday in a lifetime of
Tuesdays.

Time is a man-made construct.


EXT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Sonny waits outside in the parking lot.

He stares up into the sky. The bright sun shining. He watches
a plane high in the sky. Just a dot from where he's standing.

It floats through the air in a straight line, as if it was
being pulled by a string.

He breathes in. Breathes out.

A LIMO PULLS UP.

FALK steps out first. Gives Sonny a thin smile and a nod.
Like he can't even believe they're here.
                                                        86.


Deloris and James next.

                    SONNY
          You made it.

                    JAMES JORDAN
          Long time no see. You got that van
          up here?

                    SONNY
          Had to return it unfortunately.

                    JAMES JORDAN
          Damn shame.

Sonny goes to give Deloris a hug. She takes a step back.
Reaches out her hand. Sonny nods. OK, not an ideal start.

                     DELORIS JORDAN
              (leaning closer to Sonny)
          He doesn't want to be here. But
          he's going to listen. He promised
          me that. So... you have our
          attention.

And from behind them... out walks...

MICHAEL JORDAN. You know what he looks like. He doesn't need
description. Jordan is the sun of the solar system that is
any room he's in.

                    SONNY
          Michael or Mike?

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          Whichever you'd like, Mr. Vacarro.

                     DELORIS JORDAN
          Michael.

Nods. Deloris has spoken. They head through the front doors
to...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - ENTRANCE - DAY

A banner hangs across the entrance: "THE NIKE FAMILY WELCOMES
THE JORDAN FAMILY"

A table with a full spread from Hardee's. A feast. Everything
on the menu. Maybe more.
                                                        87.


                    DELORIS JORDAN
          I didn't know they had Hardee's in
          Oregon.

                    JAMES JORDAN
              (discreetly)
          They don't.

Strasser waits for them by the table.

                    STRASSER
          Take whatever you'd like. Right
          this way, Michael.

The party all make their way to...


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The same conference room Sonny and Strasser have been sitting
in over the past few days. They all find their seats.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          I'm gonna be honest... I liked the
          Lakers. I like Marques Jordan. And
          I like Adidas. I like Adidas shoes.

The AJ1's. They look even better in person. High cut leather.
Pristine condition. The red and black almost radiating.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN (CONT'D)
          Wow.

                    STRASSER
              (handing the shoes to
               Jordan)
          Go ahead, take a look.

                    PETER MOORE
          I know you like the shoes low to
          the ground. We skived the
          cushioning down so you'll be as
          close to the floor as possible. We
          can tailor them however you like,
          but these are pretty damn low.
              (off Jordan, nodding)
          The shoe will be designed
          specifically for you. We'll build
          it off a cast of your foot.

                    STRASSER
          What do you think?
                                                           88.


                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          That shoe is red and black.

                    STRASSER
          Yeah.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          You have to wear white in the NBA.

                    STRASSER
          Says who? Adidas?

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          Well, yeah... those are the
          rules...

                    STRASSER
          Well, we'll see about that.

PHIL gives a knock at the door and walks in.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Hello. I'm sorry I'm running a bit
          behind. Phil Knight.

                    STRASSER
          Let's roll the tape...

The lights dim. The projector boots up. And on the screen...

A highlight tape of Jordan's UNC highlights set to the
Pointer Sisters "JUMP".

Sonny watches the Jordan family closely. Examining their
faces for any sign or hint.

And it's clear to him. They look bored. They don't look
impressed.

Sonny looks around. At Strasser. At Phil. We see it in his
eyes. He needs to do something.

                    SONNY
          Hey. Hey. Shut the video off.

Everyone at the table starts to look around. What the hell is
going on?

Sonny stands up. The video abruptly halts.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Hold on. Forget all this. Forget
          where we are. Forget Nike.
                                                           89.


                     PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny...

                    SONNY
          Let's stop with the bullshit.

Sonny looks right at Jordan.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Forget about the shoes. Forget
          about the money. You're going to
          make so much money that it's not
          going to matter. You'll never want
          again. Money can buy you almost
          anything... but it can't buy you
          immortality. That... you have to
          earn.

Sonny stares Michael Jordan right in the eye. He's not
scared.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          I'm going to look you in the eyes
          and tell you the future.

INTERCUT YOUNG MICHAEL PLAYING - HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          You were cut from your high school
          basketball team. Willed your way to
          the NBA. You're going to win
          championships. It's an American
          story. And that's why America will
          love it.

INTERCUT FLASHES OF THE FUTURE:

The Michael Jordan we all know. Skinny as a rookie, streaking
down the court in iconic Bulls red.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          People are going to build you up,
          god are they going to. Because when
          you're new... We love you. Man, we
          build you up into something that
          doesn't even exist. The entire
          nation is going to say they want to
          be like a black man from rural
          North Carolina. You're going to
          change the god damn world.

Battles with the Bad Boy Pistons. Isaiah Thomas. Heartbreak.
                                                           90.


The first title. Beating Magic Johnson. Sobbing with the
Larry O'Brien Trophy.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          But you know what? When they've
          built you as high as they possibly
          can... they're going to tear you
          back down. They're going to say,
          alright let's find out what's wrong
          with you. It's the most cyclical
          pattern with fame, we build you
          into something that doesn't exist
          until we find your flaws and then
          we rip you to shreds.

The death of his father. Found murdered in a car.

His retirement from Basketball. Taking hacks in the minors
with the White Sox. Jordan rides the bus.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          This person that we built into God
          isn't a God, and that makes us feel
          better about ourselves, because
          we're not Gods. Because that's how
          it works. We can't help but fall in
          love, we pretend it's something
          that it isn't, because we're
          flawed.

Coming out of retirement. The "I'm back" press release.

The second three-peat.

Hitting the final shot of his Bulls career. The leap. The
fist pump.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          A shoe is just a shoe until
          somebody wears it. Context is
          everything. Boring running shoe
          right? What if I told you it was
          the shoe that took the gold medal?
          Changes everything. Context is
          everything. All we're doing is
          providing that context from the
          start. A shoe that serves as a
          method of expression. A converse
          will always just be a converse.
          Your name isn't on it. Yeah, you
          could be mentioned in the same
          sentence as Magic and Bird. But you
          know what's better than that?
              (off MJ)
                    (MORE)
                                                        91.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Being mentioned all on your own. A
          tier of one. We're going to NAME
          the shoe after you. No one else has
          that. No one. Not Magic. Not Bird.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Everyone at this table will be
          forgotten as soon as our time on
          this cold spinning rock is over.
          Except for you. You will be
          remembered forever. Because some
          things are eternal.
              (a long pause as he goes
               for the finish)
          You're Michael Jordan... and your
          story is going to be the history of
          flight.

The lights come up. Strasser looks to Phil and Pete. Holy
shit.

Sonny places the shoe on the table.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          We've shared our offer with Mr.
          Falk. But if you'd like to take a
          look...
              (he slides stapled paper
               across the table)
          This would be the largest
          endorsement deal in basketball
          history.

                    DAVID FALK
          We're expecting others to bid in a
          similar range.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Yes, thank you, Mr. Falk. My point
          stands: Nike has been in search of
          a basketball star, and we believe
          you are that star, Michael.

                      DELORIS JORDAN
          Well... thank you, Mr. Vaccaro.
               (she looks around the
                room)
          Mr. Knight. Mr. Strasser. Thank
          you.

                    DAVID FALK
          We'll be assessing everything
          tomorrow. And we should have an
          answer for you shortly after that.
                                                        92.


Sonny catches their eyes on the way out. Nods.

Everyone waits until the Jordan party is out the door. They
look around.

Sonny is just standing there. Almost in a daze.

                    STRASSER
          Where did that come from?

                    SONNY
          I don't know.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I think we got him.

                      STRASSER
          I do too.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          All we can do is wait for the call.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Moonlight shines through the blinds.

He sits down at his desk. Leans back in his chair. And for
the first time...

Sonny closes his eyes.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Those same eyes, now startled awake by...

THE RINGING PHONE.

                      SONNY
          Hello?

                    DAVID FALK
          What the fuck is this? You're
          trying to pull a fast one over us?

                    SONNY
          What are you talking about?

                    DAVID FALK
          The contract. Did you think we were
          going to just miss the clause? Our
          lawyers have six figure retainers.
                                                          93.


                    SONNY
          What clause? Falk, what are you...

We can hear Falk flipping through pages over the phone.

                     DAVID FALK
              (reading directly from the
                contract)
          If Jordan doesn't achieve one of
          following three accomplishments --
          win Rookie of the Year, become an
          All-Star or average 20 points per
          game -- in his first three years,
          Nike has the option to void the
          deal.

                    SONNY
          What the fuck? Falk, this wasn't
          me. I had--

                    DAVID FALK
          Well, guess who I just called?
          Adidas.

                    SONNY
          Falk, come on. We can work this
          out. Don't fuck me here.

                    DAVID FALK
          Fuck you??? I'm not the one who's
          trying to slip clauses into the
          contract at the twenty-fifth hour.
          Besides... they're matching. 250k.

                    SONNY
          You're shitting me.

                    DAVID FALK
          Sorry, Sonny.

                    SONNY
          I thought it wasn't about the
          money?

                    DAVID FALK
          Of course it's about the money.
          It's always about the money.

                    SONNY
          Hang on. What if we can get him a
          percentage of sales?
                                                 94.


                     DAVID FALK
          You and I both know that's not
          happening.

                    SONNY
          Give me a beat.

                    DAVID FALK
          You have sixty minutes.

                    SONNY
          Give me one-hundred-twenty.

                    DAVID FALK
          Sixty.

Sonny grits his teeth.


INT. NIKE HEADQUARTERS - PHIL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sonny barges through the door.

                    SONNY
          Who was it??

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny.

                    SONNY
          You're throwing away the biggest
          bargain you'll ever make.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Sonny... There's nothing
          unreasonable in there.

                    SONNY
          Unreasonable is not telling them it
          was going to in there. How could
          you not let me know??

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Because we knew this would be your
          reaction.
              (deep breath)
          If they can't accept it, then so be
          it. You can't stay at the table too
          long. At some point you have to
          fold. You're gambling recklessly.
                                                           95.


                    SONNY
          Adidas matched. We need to give him
          a percentage of sales. I wrote it
          in.

Sonny drops the revised contract on Phil's desk.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Absolutely not.

                    SONNY
          Phil. We don't have any other
          choice.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          We're breaking too many rules.

Sonny gets up from the chair. Walks over to Phil's wall.
TAKES A FRAME OFF IT.

                     PHIL KNIGHT (CONT'D)
          Sonny...

Sonny turns the frame over. Releases the hatch on the back.
Takes the paper out.

Places it on Phil's desk. Grabs one of Phil's pens. And
circles something. Phil looks down...

It's the NIKE TEN COMMANDMENTS. The circled sentences reads:

BREAK THE RULES: FIGHT THE LAWS.

                    SONNY
          What's the difference between a law
          and a rule? Laws are penalties by
          governance. Rules are made
          arbitrarily by a small group
          without any electoral power. You
          have no legal recourse to follow
          the rules yet they directly
          influence and control almost every
          facet of our lives. So why are we
          taught to follow the rules from the
          first day of school? Follow the
          rules. You know what the difference
          is between you and all the schmucks
          out there living in their two
          bedroom houses in the suburbs
          waking up every morning wondering
          where the hell their lives went?
          Dreading going to work?
                    (MORE)
                                                    96.

                     SONNY (CONT'D)
           Counting down the days until they
           can retire and make it all stop?
           They followed the rules and you
           didn't.

Sonny holds the commandments back up.

                     SONNY (CONT'D)
           Writing these rules down is easy.
           You know what's actually hard? What
           actually takes suffering? Living
           them. Believing them. Acting like
           they're more than just greeting
           card aphorisms on an eight-and-a-
           half by eleven piece of paper.
               (he puts the paper down)
           What'd you always tell me about
           rules?

                      PHIL KNIGHT
           Sonny...

                      SONNY
           Say it.

                      PHIL KNIGHT
               (reluctantly, sighing)
           You are remembered for the rules
           you break.

                     SONNY
           It's time to be remembered. Sign
           the paper, Phil.

Phil picks up his pen. Looks at Sonny.

Signs the paper.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny on his phone. Waiting as it rings. Until...

                     DELORIS JORDAN
               (from the phone)
           Hello?

INTERCUT

                     SONNY
           Mrs. Jordan. Is Michael there?
                                                97.


INT. JORDAN RESIDENCE - KITHCEN - DAY

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          So this time you decided you could
          call?

                    SONNY
          It was time sensitive.

                    DELORIS JORDAN
          Let me get him.

A beat as we hear her call for Michael.

                      MICHAEL JORDAN
          Hello?

                    SONNY
          Michael. It's Sonny. From Nike.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          I just don't know about these
          clauses. It's a lot to live up to.

                    SONNY
          You're going to be rookie of the
          year. Trust me.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          How do you know?

                    SONNY
          The offense is going to run through
          you. Even Hakeem isn't going to
          have that. Not right away.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          What if I get hurt?

                    SONNY
          Then you'll come back and be an all
          star. Adidas will void their
          contract if you get hurt - I
          promise you that.

                      MICHAEL JORDAN
          I just...

                    SONNY
          OK. Look around you. You're sitting
          in your childhood room right now.

                    MICHAEL JORDAN
          I'm in the kitchen.
                                                98.


                    SONNY
          OK, well your childhood room is
          upstairs.

Michael laughs.

                    SONNY (CONT'D)
          Think of all those trophies. All
          the accolades. No one handed those
          to you. You earned them. Despite
          the odds... despite everything
          against you... you earned them.
          We're asking you to take another
          risk. Is there a danger in that?
          Hell yes, there is. Believe me, I
          know. This contract... you're going
          to get out of it what you put in.
          And I know what you're going to put
          in. You'll regret a lot of things
          in life... but you're never going
          to regret betting on yourself. No
          one can take that away from you.

Close on Michael. Biting his lip. Thinking.


INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sonny's back on with Falk.

                    DAVID FALK
          At the buzzer. Always at the
          buzzer.

                     SONNY
          Faxing it now. Signed, sealed, and
          delivered.

                    DAVID FALK
          Percentage of sales?

                    SONNY
          Read it. I'm told your lawyers have
          six figure retainers.

                       DAVID FALK
          Very good.

                    SONNY
          And what about Adidas?

                    DAVID FALK
          They won't give a percentage of
          sales.
                    (MORE)
                                                     99.

                    DAVID FALK (CONT'D)
              (Sonny pumps his fist)
          They're pivoting.

                    SONNY
          To who?

                    DAVID FALK
          Mel Turpin.

                    SONNY
              (a thin smile)
          Interesting.

                    DAVID FALK
          How's Phil feeling?

                    SONNY
          Like a million bucks. Actually a
          million and a half.

                    DAVID FALK
          Well, I'd say it's been a pleasure
          doing business with you, but it
          never really is.

                    SONNY
          You better get me on speed dial. At
          least the next five years.

                    DAVID FALK
          Five years, huh? That's a long time
          for you to be anywhere.

                    SONNY
          Talk to me next week, I guess. Or
          next year. Or the next time you're
          representing a once in a generation
          talent.

                    DAVID FALK
          I have my eye on Ewing at
          Georgetown. What do you think?

                    SONNY
          I think you can get any player in
          the world after the deal we just
          signed. You're welcome.

Sonny hangs up. Takes a deep breath in. He did it.
                                                       100.


INT. PHIL KNIGHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Phil sits alone at his desk. Tossing the plastic basketball
up and down.

A KNOCK at the door. He turns to see Sonny standing in the
open frame.

                    SONNY
          You got a second?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Were you ever born?

                    SONNY
          Was I ever born?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          It feels like you just walked in
          here one morning. You know, most
          people... you can picture them as
          children. Kind of get an idea what
          their parents were like... how it
          shaped who they are today. But
          you... I can't imagine you any
          different than you are right now
          this very moment. You're going to
          be sneaking through the pearly
          gates of heaven... and the first
          thing you'll be looking for is a
          6'9 kid with a good jump shot...
          and you're going to be looking to
          make a deal.

                    SONNY
          You know I thought it was
          pronounced "Nicky" the first time I
          saw the word.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          I wanted to call the company
          Dimension Six.

                    SONNY
          That's horrible.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          You think the company still
          succeeds if it's named Dimension
          Six?

                    SONNY
          Who's to say?
                                                101.


                    PHIL KNIGHT
          We named it after the God of
          Victory.

                    STRASSER
          Is that true?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          No, a team of consultants told us
          to choose Nike because people like
          four-letter words - but I'd like to
          think we would have found it
          anyway.

                    SONNY
          What about the swoosh?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Well, it's supposed to be a sound.

                    SONNY
          A sound of what?

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          The sound of someone moving past
          you.

He shoots at the basket. It misses.

                    PHIL KNIGHT (CONT'D)
          So... we may be out of business...
          but you did it. I... might even say
          it felt like the old days. Just for
          a second there.
              (off Sonny)
          Do you want to say "I told you so?"

                    SONNY
          No. Maybe tomorrow. We got the
          happy ending.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Only if you believe in endings.

                    SONNY
          I... I can bullshit you all day,
          but... no one else would have hired
          me. That's the truth. You're going
          to take this place to the top or
          you're going to die trying.

                    PHIL KNIGHT
          Damn straight.
                                                       102.


                    SONNY
          And, fuck it... you might as well
          buy Converse one day.

                     PHIL KNIGHT
          Why?

                    SONNY
          Because you can.

Sonny leaves the room. Phil sits alone, reflecting.

He cracks a smile.

TITLE CARD READS: THREE MONTHS LATER


INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Sonny back at the grocery store.

A BOX OF WHEATIES....

Michael Jordan is on the cover. Holding Nikes.

Sonny smiles. He knows. This is just the beginning.


EXT. VACARRO HOUSEHOLD - EVENING

Sonny steps out of the door. Almost like he's sneaking out.
He quietly shuts it behind him.

He's dressed in... sweatpants? And a drab gray nike
sweatshirt.

He leans down. Tries to touch his toes, unsuccessfully.
Breathes in. And it's just about now when we understand...

He's going for a run.

He takes off. Breathing heavy. Faster. Faster.

INTERCUT TITLE CARDS:

Nike's revenue goal in year one of Air Jordan was $3 million.

SONNY SPRINTS DOWN THE STREET. The humid air heavy in his
lungs.

They sold $162 million.

He's panting. Drenched in sweat.
                                                          103.


Today, Air Jordan brings in over $3 billion in annual revenue
for Nike.

HE STOPS. Puts his hands on his knees. Gasping for air.

Looks up. The summer sun shining through the leaves.

He looks back...

He only made it a block.

But that's a start.

TITLE CARDS CONTINUE:

Phil Knight retired in 2015 after 51 years serving as CEO and
Chairman of Nike. Nike acquired Converse in 2003.

Rob Strasser left Nike in 1987 to serve as CEO of Adidas
America. He died of a heart attack in 1993.

Sonny was fired from Nike in 1991. He went on to work at
Adidas, where he helped court another once-in-a-generation
talent... Kobe Bryant.
