INT. THEATER - DAY

A MAN on a stage. Bathed in a lone spotlight, standing in a
grove of trees. Butterflies flutter around him. A soft breeze
crackles through the speakers.

He looks around at the swaying branches. And speaks.

                    MAN ON STAGE
          For aught that I could ever read,
          could ever hear by tale or history,
          the course of true love never did
          run smooth.

He stares out into the darkness of the theater and resumes
his monologue.

                    MAN ON STAGE (CONT'D)
          But either it was different in
          blood or else misgraffed in respect
          of years. Or else it stood upon the
          choice of friends. Or, if there
          were a sympathy in choice. War,
          death, or sickness did lay siege to
          it. Making it momentany as a sound.
          Swift as a shadow. Short as any
          dream. Brief as the lightning in
          the collied night. That, in a
          spleen, unfolds both heaven and
          Earth. And, ere a man hath power to
          say "Behold!" The jaws of darkness
          do devour it up. So quick bright
          things come to confusion.

The man bows his head. The spotlight goes dark.

A roar of APPLAUSE erupts in the theater.

In the darkness onstage, the man is joined by the rest of the
cast. They join hands, smile and nod to each other.

The lights flood the stage and they take their bows to the
roar of a standing ovation.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. BACKSTAGE - A LITTLE LATER

The man is holding a slice of cheese pizza in his teeth while
he changes out of his costume. INTO A GREEN JUMPSUIT.

The rest of the cast don identical jumpsuits while TWO
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS watch over them.
Yet still, the excitement among the company is electric --
everyone congratulating each other, hugging.

Soon the whole company lines up on the wall. A CORRECTIONS
OFFICER starts counting them. One after another, the cast and
crew call out their numbers.

We draw closer to the man who gave the monologue, waiting his
turn. We see the contours and shadows of his face in sharp
relief, his eyes bright despite the years on his face. This
is JOHN "DIVINE G" WHITFIELD.

                                                  CUT TO:

                         TITLE CARD.


EXT. SING SING CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - MORNING

Sing Sing Correctional Facility is rooted on the shore of the
Hudson River. Red brick, ancient stone, razor wire. The lull
of water on the bank, the breeze through forest trees.

The only prison in the U.S. where a commuter train whips
through the yard heading to Cold Spring, to Poughkeepsie, to
towns beyond.

The walls of Sing Sing barely tremble.


INT. B BLOCK - EARLY MORNING

First light. Sing Sing's infamous B BLOCK - 4 stories tall
and housing over 800 men - is raucous and echoes with noise.

As we move down the corridor we hear the sound of typing.

We arrive at Divine G's cell. He's seated in front of a
TYPEWRITER, headphones on as he types. He slides a fresh
sheet of paper, sets the margins, and continues his work.


INT. CELLBLOCK CORRIDOR - MORNING

A long line of men snaking through corridors and gates. Each
gate thundering open before them, pounding shut behind. A
sound felt in the bones.


INT. MESS HALL - LATER

Divine G moves his fork through runny powdered eggs. His
instant coffee steaming.
A man stands next to him. Divine G doesn't look up.

                    BOOK FAN
          Excuse me. I've been trying to
          catch you in the yard, but...

Divine G looks up at him. The man holds out a BOOK: a
bedraggled copy of MONEY GRIP by Divine G.

                    BOOK FAN (CONT'D)
          Mind signing it?

Divine G warms up.

                     DIVINE G
          Of course.
              (sees the title)
          You from Rikers?

                    BOOK FAN
          Spent two years there. How'd you
          know?

                    DIVINE G
          This one was very popular there for
          a while. Got a pen?

Divine G signs the book, then returns to his breakfast. The
man is still there. Standing awkwardly.

                    BOOK FAN
          Man I can't believe Puck did you
          dirty like that.

                    DIVINE G
          Hell of a twist.

                    BOOK FAN
          But hey man, for real...

He doesn't know how to say it, but he fumbles through an
AWKWARD THANK YOU to Divine G for the emotional scene on
stage.

                    BOOK FAN (CONT'D)
          I hadn't seen anything like that
          before.

Divine G removes his glasses and looks up at the man.

                    DIVINE G
          Releasing those tears is healthy
          for you. Don't tamp that shit down.
EXT. YARD - AFTERNOON

Divine G stands against a wall in a corner of the yard. He
pulls out a baggie of carrots and green beans and shakes it
out on the ground.

A GROUP OF GEESE gather around him. They know Divine G, they
eat greedily. Divine G scolds one of them.

                    DIVINE G
          Come on. Don't hog it all from your
          brothers.

He watches the patterns of men in the yard.

Then a SIREN WAILS and Divine G drops onto his belly, puts
his hands on the back of his head along with everyone else in
the yard.


INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Divine G -- reading glasses low on his nose and a notepad in
his lap -- sits with a group of four other men in a cramped
classroom. This is the STEERING COMMITTEE.

Inspirational posters hang askew on the walls around them:

    You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

     Attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?

                    DIVINE G
          Alright gentlemen. Beautiful work
          last night. Let's hear those kudos.

The men discuss their favorite parts of the production. The
beautiful moments, the standout performances, the gaffes, the
reactions from the crowd.

                    JJ
          But G. That monologue... I never
          heard population that quiet.

                    DAP
          When you looked around at those
          butterflies...

The group murmurs in appreciation of the moment.

                    DIVINE G
          It's because I forgot the rest of
          the monologue. I was thinking.
They all laugh.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Dropped two lines though. I'll
          never forgive myself.

Divine G flips the page on his clipboard.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Now, uh, we also need to talk about
          what we can do better. Those
          transitions were... rough.

                    MIKE MIKE
          Man. I'm still riding high. Already
          miss stepping on the wood.
              (looking around)
          Maybe talk about improvements at
          the next meeting.

The others nod. So Divine G flips another page.

                    DIVINE G
          Alright. Well, Want to go over the
          waitlist? See if there's anyone to
          pull up?

They review the waitlist. Debate different men vying for
acceptance into the program. Who they think has the most to
gain from the work.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          What about Curtis Cross?

                    MIKE MIKE
          I talked to some people about him.
          He's not serious. He's just wants
          to be a star. Steal the show.

                    DIVINE G
          Alright. Maybe he stays on the
          waitlist one more round. Then we
          revisit him?

They agree.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          One more. This is his second
          request. Divine Eye.

The others are wary of the idea. Divine Eye has a reputation
for running the yard.
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I know it. But he's teaching a
          history class with the NAACP. He's
          smart. He just needs something
          better than yard work to channel
          his talents into.

The others still aren't convinced.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Isn't that why we're here? To go
          after the ones who need this
          program?

They get quiet.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Let's just interview him. See
          what's what.

They agree.


EXT. YARD BERM - ANOTHER DAY

Divine G and Mike Mike are talking on the edge of the yard.
Both scanning the yard, looking for someone.

                    MIKE MIKE
              (looks at the sky)
          It's too hot for this. Let's look
          for him another day.

Divine G just watches the yard.

                    DIVINE G
          There he is.

Divine G starts walking, Mike Mike follows.


EXT. YARD COURTYARD, 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

They approach a man walking across the yard. He's broad-
shouldered and muscular, yet graceful: like he could dance as
well as he could fight. This is CLARENCE "DIVINE EYE" MACLIN.

                    DIVINE G
          Excuse me, could I have a word? I--

                    DIVINE EYE
          Be with you in a second. I gotta
          take care of something right quick.
Divine Eye keeps walking. He descends some steps into the
lower courtyard. Divine G and Mike Mike stand there, annoyed,
and watch what unfolds below.


EXT. YARD COURTYARD, 1ST LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Divine G and Mike Mike watch from a distance as Divine Eye
approaches a YOUNG PRISONER -- clearly new here -- who has
been waiting for him. This is CLAY. Divine Eye steps close to
him.

                    CLAY
          Oh hey man.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Yo. Nice layup out there.

                    CLAY
          You saw that?

                    DIVINE EYE
          What you mean? Of course I saw
          that.

Divine Eye leans closer.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          You got what I left with you?

                    CLAY
          Yeah, of course. I held it all day
          just like you told me.

                     DIVINE EYE
          And you didn't tell no one you had
          it, right?

                    CLAY
          No, no, of course not.

They stand there awkwardly a moment.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Well let's see it then.

                     CLAY
          Oh yeah.

Clay scrambles in his pockets. Brings out SQUARE OF TIN FOIL,
folded tightly around something. Hands it to Divine Eye.
                    DIVINE EYE
          Appreciate you helping me out like
          that. I won't forget it.

Divine G and Mike Mike just watch as this unfolds.

Divine Eye opens the packet just enough to check the
contents. A ROUGH-CRUSHED WHITE POWDER.

Divine Eye looks confused at it. Then at the Young Man.

                     CLAY
          What...?

                    DIVINE EYE
          What the fuck is this?

                     CLAY
          What?

                    DIVINE EYE
          What do you mean, what? This ain't
          what I gave you.

Divine Eye tastes some on his finger. Shakes his head.

                    CLAY
          Huh? Yes it is, I just--

                    DIVINE EYE
          What is this, fucking aspirin? What
          the fuck are you trying to pull?

                    CLAY
          Hey man, I didn't... I put it in my
          pocket just like you told me and--

                    DIVINE EYE
              (quietly livid)
          You think I'm a fucking fool?

                    CLAY
          No man, I swear to God.

                    DIVINE EYE
          You saying I'm lying then? That I
          don't know what I'm looking at?
          Taste it.

                    CLAY
          No, I believe you, I just--
                    DIVINE EYE
          This is aspirin. You know what I
          fucking left with you?

                      CLAY
          No.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Not fucking aspirin.

Divine Eye shoves it back to him. He steps close. The other
man is trying hard to stand there.

                      DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          I don't   know what you did or didn't
          do, and   I don't care. That was five
          hundred   dollars. You fucked me. Now
          you owe   me five hundred dollars.

                    CLAY
          Oh please man, come on--

                    DIVINE EYE
          Next time I see you, you better
          have a plan for how to get me my
          money.

Divine Eye leaves Clay there, stunned.


EXT. YARD COURTYARD, 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Divine Eye is laughing as he climbs the stairs back to where
Divine G and Mike Mike wait for him.

                    MIKE MIKE
          That's fucked up.

                     DIVINE EYE
          He's gotta learn what it's like
          around here. Can't be going around
          trusting people. What can I help
          yall with?

                    DIVINE G
          You signed up for RTA. We've got a
          couple openings for our next
          production. Maybe you could put
          your acting talents to better use
          than hustling people.

                    DIVINE EYE
          What, that? That was nothing. You
          haven't seen acting yet.
Divine G seems to be studying him.

                    DIVINE G
          Why did you sign up for the
          program?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Heard yall got chick volunteers.

Divine G just stares at him. Sees through the act.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          Do I need a reason?

                    DIVINE G
          No. You just have to be honest.

Divine Eye looks around.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm bored. Tired of this yard shit.
          I came across this book that fell
          off the library cart. Read a couple
          lines. When we are born, we cry
          that we are born to this great
          stage of fools. I thought, this cat
          must've done some time. He knows
          what's going on.

                    DIVINE G
          So King Lear just happened to fall
          off the library cart? And you just
          read a few lines.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Yeah well, life's funny, isn't it?

Divine G tries to hide his smile.

                    DIVINE G
          We'll be in touch.

Divine G and Mike Mike leave.


EXT. HUDSON RIVER - MORNING

The water is gentle over the Hudson. Sing Sing's walls paint
the shoreline. CO's move between guard towers like toy
soldiers. A sailboat lists by lazily.
INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

The classroom is now bustling with 15 MEN who have been
selected for the program.

A few actors filtering coffee through a sock. Others are
warming up with vocal exercises.

Divine G catches a glimpse of Divine Eye stepping into the
classroom. Circling the room, not sure where to stand or who
to talk to.

Soon, a civilian VOLUNTEER strides in, wearing work boots and
aviator pants. A gold post earring and a long white ponytail.
This is BRENT.

                    BRENT
          Hello everyone. I see some familiar
          faces, but for those of you who
          don't know me, my name is Brent,
          I'll be at your service as your
          director for, whatever you decide
          to do for your upcoming production.
          But there's plenty of time for all
          that later. For now, let's start
          with a warmup.

He gathers everyone into a circle and moves to the center. He
tells them to start moving.

Then he gives them cues to perform different walks: Walk like
an old man. Like a model. Like a zombie. Like someone who's
won the lottery.

The awkwardness fades from them and everyone loosens up.


INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

The company are all seated in chairs in a big circle.

                    BRENT
          Gentlemen. Congratulations on
          Midsummer. You did beautiful work.
          You should be proud. Have you
          decided what's next?

The men start to discuss a range of shows. From On The
Waterfront to A Few Good Men to Candide to...

Then one of the men speaks up. Says it's time they finally
put on one of Divine G's plays. Novelist. Memoirist. Winner
of four national writing competitions.
                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          I love it. Do you have something in
          mind, G?

                    DIVINE G
          Well, I don't know...

The company pushes him, tells him to spit it out.

Divine G starts to pitch it.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          OK. I just finished one actually.
          It's called, Fine Print. It's the
          saga of Zabar Turner, a record
          producer, who gets tricked into
          signing over his record company by
          the conniving Fast Freddy. It's a
          story of his journey to get his
          studio back. It's about friendship,
          the dangers of overzealous
          ambition, betrayal, and the power
          of perseverance. And how all
          relationships under heaven
          contain... Fine Print.

The company eats it up.

                    BRENT
          Wow. Sounds amazing. Well, do we
          have a any other ideas? Or should
          we take a vote?

Divine Eye raises his hand.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Yes, a new face. Hi.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Yeah, I don't want to step on
          anybody's toes in here, and I don't
          mean no disrespect, but does every
          play have to be so serious?

                    MIKE MIKE
          What do you mean?

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm just saying, every day in here
          is a drama. Every day is a tragedy.
          Might be nice to do, I don't know,
          a comedy. Population might
          appreciate it.
Divine G just listens.

                    BRENT
          How does everyone else feel?

The rest of the men are warming to it.

                    DIVINE EYE
          With a comedy, you could really
          turn it up. Have music numbers,
          dance numbers. Make it big.

                    DIVINE G
          What kind of comedy would you
          propose doing?

                    DIVINE EYE
          What do you mean, what kind of
          comedy?

                    DIVINE G
          Do you want to do something broad?
          Want to be more low-key and do
          satire? Is it musical or not?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Man I don't know. I'm just saying--

                    DAP
          A cowboy comedy.

Everyone goes quiet and looks at him.

                    DAP (CONT'D)
          I've always wanted to do a cowboy
          play.

This opens the floodgates. The men start throwing out random
ideas for the comedy: Pirates, Ancient Egypt, Robin Hood.
Freddy Krueger.

                    MIKE MIKE
          OK hold on. Does anyone know a
          comedy out there has all that?

Someone suggests Divine G write it.

                    DIVINE G
          That's not really in my wheelhouse.

                    BIG E
          It could time travel.
                    DIVINE G
          I know, but--

                    BRENT
          That's true. It could time travel
          through all these places. Have a
          ton of roles to get more people up
          on stage. Have a message.

All eyes go to Brent.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          I uh... I could write it if you
          aren't feeling it, G.

                    DIVINE G
          Doesn't bother me. If everyone else
          is on board.

                    BRENT
          I'll run it by Katherine and if the
          script is bad, we can always pivot
          to something else.

                    MIKE MIKE
          Well. I guess let's take a vote.
          All in favor of this original
          comedy...

Everyone raises their hand.


INT. DIVINE G'S CELL - LATER

Divine G is at his desk after lights out. Trying to repair
the bent arm of his glasses without breaking them.

A voice comes from the cell across from his.

                    MIKE MIKE (O.C.)
          I've read five drafts of Fine
          Print. It's good man. And I mean...
          it could be funny. With the right
          take. Or maybe you could write a
          musical number in it.

                    DIVINE G
              (laughs)
          It's a straight drama. No point
          trying to change that.
                    MIKE MIKE (O.C.)
          Do you have another play that's
          funnier? Maybe we can take another
          vote.

                    DIVINE G
          Appreciate it brother. But--

                    MIKE MIKE (O.C.)
          I think it's important that we do a
          play written by one of our own. It
          would say a lot. And I hate to see
          you get passed over when--

                    DIVINE G
          Mike Mike. Please. I'm really OK
          with it. When the time is right --
          if the time is right -- we'll do
          one of mine. If not, it's fine man.
          Besides, it's not like we're short
          on time in here.

He hears Mike Mike sigh.

                    MIKE MIKE (O.C.)
          OK OK. Not trying to be pushy.

Divine G sets the glasses down. Thinks.

                    DIVINE G
          I can't remember the last time
          everyone was that excited about a
          play. Maybe he's right. Maybe a
          comedy will take the edge off
          around here.

                    MIKE MIKE
          I'll say one thing, it'll be easier
          than all that dying stuff from the
          last production.

Divine G resumes his work resurrecting the glasses.

                    DIVINE G
          Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.


INT. CLASSROOM - ONLY DAYS LATER

The theater group is together again. Brent is passing out
scripts for the play. He looks exhausted from jamming this
play out in just a few days.

Divine G looks at the title page. BREAKIN' THE MUMMY'S CODE.
                    BRENT
          I took everything you all wanted
          and put it in here. Ancient Egypt,
          pirates, Old West Gunfights. And I
          sprinkled in the Black Plague and
          Roman Gladiators because it seemed
          like a good idea at the time.

                    DIVINE G
              (thumbing through)
          A hundred and forty-seven pages...

                    MIKE MIKE
          ...over the weekend?

                    BRENT
          It was a lot to fit in. It's got
          some dance numbers, some songs, a
          Hamlet soliloquy. But at its heart,
          it's the story of an Egyptian
          prince who follows clues through
          time to find his Mummy.

The men are trying to follow along. They start asking
questions about the plot, about how Hamlet fits in to Ancient
Egypt, is Freddy Krueger in there.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Yes. Freddy is in there. It will
          make sense when you read it. For
          now, just find a character you
          identify with. Cast list is on the
          board. Pick an audition slot.
          There's enough for everyone to have
          at least one role in here.


INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Brent sits at a long table with Divine G and the Steering
Committee. Each with a notepad and a script.

The door opens and one of the men steps in. They thank him
for coming and ask him what role he's going out for. He names
three characters.

                    BRENT
          OK. Whenever you're ready.

The man stands quietly a moment, readying himself. Then he
bursts into an incredibly intense rendition of "HAPPY
BIRTHDAY".

In Divine G's notes, he just puts a question mark.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

AUDITION MONTAGE.

Actors step in one after another. Their auditions range from
the silly to the profound.

They act out gonzo scenes from the play. Tell stories from
their childhood. Sing. Dance. Freestyle rap.

They are all range of ages and talents.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

And finally we land on Divine G as he FINISHES HIS AUDITION.

He went to the bottom of the well to pull out what he just
brought.

The Committee is speechless. Divine G is still recovering.

He goes to take his seat but they tell him he can't observe
the next audition since they're going out for the same part.

                    DIVINE G
          Someone else is going out for
          Hamlet?

                    BRENT
          Divine Eye is.

Divine G nods, pretends it doesn't bother him.

                    DIVINE G
          I'll send him in.


INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Divine G steps out of the classroom. Divine Eye waits on a
bench with his head leaned back against the wall, as if he
might be asleep.

                       DIVINE G
          You're up.

Divine Eye stands.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Sounded good in there. Intense.
                     DIVINE G
          Thanks. Hey... Could I ask you
          something?

                      DIVINE EYE
          Anything.

                    DIVINE G
          You asked to do a comedy.

                      DIVINE EYE
          Yes.

                    DIVINE G
          And now we're doing a comedy.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm excited.

                    DIVINE G
          And yet you're auditioning for the
          only dramatic role in the whole
          play.

Divine Eye thinks a moment.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Comedy's tough, man. I don't want
          to bomb up there.

Divine G nods.

                    DIVINE G
          Good luck then.

Divine Eye steps into the room.

Divine G takes a seat in the corridor, listening to the
muffled audition through the walls.


INT. REC ROOM - DAY

Close on Divine G. Sitting up alert in a chair.

                    DIVINE G
          I would also like to note,
          Commissioners, that I was a
          candidate to become a New York City
          Police Officer.
                    VOICE (O.C.)
          I see that in your packet. I'm just
          going to go out on a limb here and
          guess that that was before you
          became a rampaging drug dealer.

                    DIVINE G
          Well sir, I only hustled that one
          year after my accident and then...
          Mike Mike, can you get your feet
          off the desk?


INT. REC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see Mike Mike now. They're on opposite sides of a desk.

Mike Mike puts his feet down.

                      MIKE MIKE
          My bad.

                    DIVINE G
          It's just hard to get the vibe with
          you lounging like that.

                    MIKE MIKE
          Alright, I got you.

Mike Mike gets back into character, serious again. He talks
like a cop from an old movie.

                    MIKE MIKE (CONT'D)
          We're not interested in what you
          could have been, Whitfield. We're
          here to talk about what you are. I
          see here you were in a group called
          Mix Machine. Is that some sort of
          criminal gang organization?

                    DIVINE G
          No. That was a DJ group. We were--

                     MIKE MIKE
          I'll bet it was funky as hell,
          wasn't it?

Divine G stares at him. Tries to keep a straight face.

                      MIKE MIKE (CONT'D)
          Admit it!

Divine G bursts out laughing.
INT. THEATER - LATER

The theater inside is cavernous, with dramatic arched
ceilings, light pouring in through big windows.

The whole company is gathered on stage. Brent has handed out
the roles to everyone. They're looking over their sides.
Divine G flips through his script, reserved. Divine Eye is
trying to find his part in his.

Most are excited.

                    CARMINE
          Man. How was I cast as a tree?

                    DINO
          I started out as background on my
          first production. Can't have a
          believable Sherwood Forest without
          believable trees.

Brent begins an exercise.

                    BRENT
          OK. I want you all to step into the
          circle, say your name, step out,
          then step back in and introduce
          yourself as your character, in that
          voice.

They begin. Through this we get a glimpse into the
personalities of each man.

It comes to Divine Eye. He steps forward with his own name.
When he steps forward again, it's in the exact same tone.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Prince Hamlet of Denmark.

The others won't accept it. They make him go again. He goes
way over the top sarcastically.

Divine G watches Divine Eye as he steps back into the circle,
barely paying attention.

The exercise circles around finally comes to Divine G. He
steps forward with his name. And then comes forward again
completely transformed. Like he grew two feet.

                    DIVINE G
          Gladiator Goliathon.
INT. THEATER / ONSTAGE - LATER

They have transitioned into the work for the day. Brent gives
an overview of the rehearsal schedule. The big dance and
musical numbers.

An actor RAISES HIS HAND.

                     BRENT
          Yes.

                    MOSI
          I have a question about my
          character. Wouldn't he be freaked
          out by some cat from Ancient Egypt
          time traveling into the Middle
          Ages? I mean, if I put myself into
          the mind of someone from that time,
          I don't even know what a mummy is.
          And do we even have a common
          language?

                    BRENT
          Well, good questions, but remember,
          it's a comedy, so we can take some
          liberties and have fun with it. Why
          don't we workshop it when we get to
          it and see how it plays?

Another actor raises his hand.

                    DAP
          I also had a question. Of what
          nature is the time travel in this
          play?

                    BRENT
          The nature of...?

                    DAP
          Is it via a wormhole? A rip in the
          space-time fabric? I'm just
          wondering how we play it. How hard
          would it be on the human body?

                    BRENT
          Well, again, those are great
          questions, but um... why don't we
          take those scene by scene?

Divine G steps up.

                    DIVINE G
          Brent. May I?
Brent nods.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
              (to everyone)
          Listen. You guys wanted a cowboy
          play, you wanted Ancient Egypt.
          Somebody asked for Freddy Krueger
          for some reason. And Brent gave us
          all that. How did you think that
          was going to happen?

No one has an answer.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Let's just focus on getting our
          scenes up on their feet, focus on
          the emotion of your scene and if
          that's true, then the play will
          start to come together.

                    BRENT
          Well, uh, thanks. That's great. Why
          don't we start with your scene?

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. THEATER / ONSTAGE - LATER

Divine G is with Mike Mike. They're working out a scene,
reading from sides as they act.

Divine G's years of skill shines through in this moment. He
reads from the script as he moves around the stage and
somehow emotion flows out of every moment.

Divine Eye stands in the wings, barely paying attention.

They wrap Divine G's scene.

                    BRENT
          Amazing! Who's next?

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'll do my scene.


INT. THEATER / ONSTAGE - LATER

Divine Eye is center stage with his scene partners. He's
trying to keep up with them as they do the scene, but he
keeps losing his place in the scene, fumbling lines. Squints
at his page. Complains that he doesn't have his glasses.
Someone gives him a pair. Still brutal.
Brent helps him, tells him to move his thumb along the side
of the page by the line he's on.

All of Divine Eye's confidence is gone as he limps through
the scene.

They mercifully reach the end.

                    BRENT
          OK, that was a good start. It will
          get smoother. Who wants to go next?

The group moves on to the next scene.

Divine G watches Divine Eye disappear down to the theater
seats and just wait to leave.


INT. SING SING HALLWAY - LATER

Class is over. Divine G and the other members of the Steering
Committee are standing in line, waiting for a gate to open.

They're talking about how crazy the play is. Asking if
they're in over their heads.

                    DAP
          So is the mummy time traveling too?
          Or just her son?

                    MIKE MIKE
          I thought the mummy was a metaphor.

                    JJ
          Forget that. How are we going to
          get this thing done? It's too many
          props, too much wardrobe.

                    DINO
          And it's going to run four hours. B
          Block will kill us. Right there on
          stage, they'll walk up and murder
          every one of us.

                    MIKE MIKE
          At least we won't have to finish
          the play.

Divine G is just listening.

                    JJ
          Maybe we postpone until the fall.
          Skip this production and give
          ourselves more time to prep.
They look to Divine G.

                    DIVINE G
          I say we go for it. I think this is
          one of those instances where the
          art we are seeking is also seeking
          us. I have no idea why...
              (laughs)
          Trust the process.


INT. THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

The group is in the middle of another exercise: physical
acting. They're "becoming objects": a statue, a tree, a
tomato.

When it's Divine Eye's turn, he declines.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm good man. I'll catch it on the
          next round.

It throws off the energy of the group. But they move on.


INT. THEATER - LATER

Later, they're done for the day. Everyone looks exhausted as
they're straightening the room. Divine G stops Divine Eye on
his way out.

                    DIVINE G
          Yo. Before you leave, let me show
          you something.

Divine Eye looks to others leaving, as if he has somewhere to
be.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          It'll only take a second.

                       DIVINE EYE
          Alright.


INT. THEATER / WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Divine G leads Divine Eye deeper backstage. To a corner with
a LITTLE CAGED WINDOW. Through it they can see rolling green
mountains.

Divine G stands by the window. Divine Eye is looking around
the room.
                    DIVINE EYE
          You know they call this room The
          Steeple. Lotta business gets done
          in here.

                    DIVINE G
          Window's got a nice view too. You
          ever look out there?

Divine Eye stares at him.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I don't look where I can't go. And
          I don't think you brought me up
          here to look at some mountains.

The conversation stops cold a moment.

                    DIVINE G
          Listen. You uh, you seem...
          frustrated with the work. I can see
          you struggling and I've been there.
          It's--

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm not struggling, those exercises
          are just goofy.

                    DIVINE G
          They're leading to something
          bigger. You'll find the depth if
          you lean into it. There's no bottom
          to what the work will give you if
          you--

                    DIVINE EYE
          Is this the speech you give all the
          new guys?

                    DIVINE G
          It's not a--

                    DIVINE EYE
          Listen man, I know your type.
          Always gotta be up front. On top.
          Herding everybody around with your
          lessons. But I don't need that. I
          didn't come here for that.

Divine G is quiet a moment, thinking of how polite to be.

                    DIVINE G
          I've been wanting to put a play of
          mine up for years. Years.
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          But then you walk in and ask for a
          comedy and now... Here we are. But
          I didn't say one word. You know
          why?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Cause I was right. Cause everybody
          likes a comedy.

                    DIVINE G
          Because it's what the group wanted.
          It doesn't matter what I want.
          Doesn't matter if we never do one
          of my plays. No one is bigger than
          the program. No one.

                    DIVINE EYE
              (sarcastic)
          Well you're a real big person.
          That's--

                     DIVINE G
          I know you've got a knife in your
          waistband.

Divine Eye is quiet at that.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          You think it makes you stronger but
          it's a false strength. That yard
          shit is not necessary in here.

                     DIVINE EYE
          I don't need you telling me what's
          necessary.

                    DIVINE G
          You've got your armor up. Afraid of
          what might be underneath it. Afraid
          that if--

                    DIVINE EYE
          You practice that line?

They stare at each other.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          How about this? I do my thing, you
          do yours. And don't take me into
          any dark corners no more. That
          makes a xxxxxx nervous, you feel
          me?
                    DIVINE G
              (quickly)
          Hey we don't say that in here. We
          use beloved. And if I--

Divine G takes a deep breath. Re-centers.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          All I want to say is: you signed up
          for this program. You could have
          the respect for your brothers to
          try a little when you show up. At
          least don't fuck it up for them.

Divine Eye stares at him like he might try taking his head
off shortly.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          This place is sacred. It's fragile.
          This program is on a tightrope and
          if they take it away... They'll
          take any excuse to shut us down. A
          blade would be a pretty good
          excuse. That's all I want to say to
          you. Please remember how much these
          guys need this.

                       DIVINE EYE
          That's it?

                       DIVINE G
          That's it.

Divine G leaves him there at the window.


INT. MESS HALL - ANOTHER DAY

Divine G sits at a table by himself. Jots notes on a legal
pad while he sips his coffee.

Divine G looks up to see Divine Eye moving along a table,
stopping every few men, small exchanges of product and
currency, subtle as sleight of hand.

Divine G returns to his legal pad, tries to ignore it,
frustration starting to burn in him.


INT. THEATER - LATER THAT DAY

The group sits in a circle onstage. They start roll call.
They're missing two.
                    MOSI
          Carlos is on A Block. They've been
          on keeplock all day.

                    BRENT
          What about Divine Eye? Is he on A
          Block?

                    BIG E
          Nope. He's B Block. No idea where
          he is.

They decide to move on with class.

Divine G stares at the empty chair where Divine Eye should
be.


INT. DIVINE G'S CELL - NIGHT

Divine G is back in his cell, working at his desk.

The gates open and a CO appears.

                    CO
          Random contraband check. Step out
          of the cell.

Divine G knows the drill. He sighs. Steps out and holds onto
the bars.

The CO goes in the cell and turns it over, goes through every
drawer, turns over his bed, fans out books and drops them.
Turns meticulous order to chaos.

Divine G just stares off into space.

Finally the CO finishes.

                    CO (CONT'D)
          OK. Go back in.

Divine G returns to his cell and starts to piece it together
as the gate slams behind him.


INT. THEATER - LATER

All the men sit onstage, cross-legged. Brent walks between
them.

                    BRENT
          Close your eyes and go to your most
          perfect spot. Most perfect moment.
                    (MORE)
                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          What are the sounds? Do you hear
          anything? Who is there?

Divine G closes his eyes. Slows his breathing. He hears
someone come in and join the circle late. He sneaks a look.
It's Divine Eye.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Do you feel the temperature? Is
          there a breeze? Are you inside?
          Out? What are the smells? Hold
          yourself there. And... open your
          eyes.

Divine G opens his eyes. The men are squinting at the light.
He sees Divine Eye, his face is serene.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Does anyone want to describe where
          you just were?

The men look around at each other.

Then begin to share their perfect spots...

It comes around to Divine Eye, he makes a joke about how
wherever he was there was hammock there. But even though he
won't admit it, it's clear by his face he really went
somewhere.

Finally it comes around to Mike Mike.

                    MIKE MIKE
          You know uh... I really tried to go
          somewhere else. Squeezed my eyes.
          Sniffed around. And I came up
          empty. Just blank nothing. I guess
          I've been here too long to imagine
          anything out there. But uh...
              (looks around at the
               circle)
          If I gotta be stuck somewhere. This
          is where I'd be here. Right here
          with yall. This spot. This is
          perfect.


INT. THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

Divine Eye is in the middle of blocking his scene. Divine G
is with the rest of the company that circles the stage,
watching on.
Divine Eye is agitated, having trouble focusing. One of the
men walks behind him in the blocking.

                     DIVINE EYE
          Hey hey. He can't walk back there.
          I get nervous with people walking
          behind me.

The guy stops, looks to Brent.

                    BRENT
          Well you're gonna have to get used
          to that. Or act like it doesn't
          bother you.

                    DIVINE EYE
          He could walk in front of me.

                    BRENT
          At some point, someone will walk
          behind you. Do you remember your
          first mark?

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm supposed to be next to
          Gravedigger. Then Leslie and Marion
          magically appear stage left. Got
          it.

                    BRENT
          Great. Let's run it.

Divine Eye tries to calm himself. Begins his soliloquy.
Stumbles.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Shit. Line!

                    BRENT
          Whether `tis nobler... Let's take
          it from the top.

They do, but now it's not just Divine Eye stumbling. The
others in the scene are too. They can't find a rhythm.

It starts to get TENSE. Guys are getting agitated. One curses
himself.

Suddenly Dino's voice cut's through the group.

                    DINO
          Stop!

Dino is quiet a moment, then speaks up from the wings.
[What follows is a real story.]

                    DINO (CONT'D)
          I was a keeplock monster. My anger
          consumed me. I worked everything
          out with violence. But one morning
          at breakfast there was this guy
          sitting across from me -- had a big
          mole on his nose, I'll never forget
          that. I don't know who he was but
          somebody stepped up behind him and
          just cut him. Ear to ear, didn't
          say nothing. The blood, it was...
          everywhere. On the table, on my
          clothes, on my... face. But I
          didn't move. None of us did. We
          just sat there... still. Didn't
          even look at him as he died. Back
          in my cell I realized... that's not
          normal. I started to feel like I
          wasn't even human. After that day
          everything changed. I heard about
          this and my first thought was,
          dressing up in funny outfits and
          dancing around in a max security
          prison is not a great idea. But I
          gave it a shot. First time I felt
          like a human in... since I could
          remember. It showed me the way
          back.

The tension from the room is gone. They get back to work.


INT. SING SING HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY

Divine G stands in a long line of people in a hallway. The
gate ahead is shut -- they're stuck between places.

They've been waiting here a long time. Divine G is clearly
agitated.

One man in line yells out to ask what's going on. A CO yells
back for him to shut the fuck up.

So they continue to wait.


INT. THEATER - LATER THAT DAY

Divine G is sitting in a row of empty seats. He watches the
actors onstage blocking a dance number for a pirate ship
scene. Brent directs the action.
The men aren't off book. They don't know their marks yet. The
choreography is all over the place.

Divine G jots some notes in a notebook on his lap.

Soon, Divine Eye comes and sits in the row behind him,
soaking wet from the rain.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Why ain't you up there?

                    DIVINE G
              (without looking back)
          We're not rehearsing any scenes I'm
          in today.

                    DIVINE EYE
          So you just come through to keep a
          check on everybody?

                    DIVINE G
          I just enjoy watching them is all.

They stumble onstage. Someone curses himself. Brent
encourages him.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          It's a good reminder to see it when
          it's so... rough. But I know,
          somehow someway, it'll all come
          together by opening night. Trust
          the process. That's what we say in
          here.

                    DIVINE EYE
          What are those notes then? Writing
          love letters?

Divine G moves his hand over the notebook, covering the page.

                    DIVINE G
          Nah. Legal work. Some brothers want
          healthier food in the mess hall.
          I'm researching some litigation to
          see if we can fix that.

Divine Eye nods, watches the stage a moment.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          So you just drifted on in, huh?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Yeah...
Divine Eye is quiet a moment.

The ship backdrop onstage almost falls over, the actors have
to hold it up while they devise a way to keep it standing.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          You're telling me that's normal?

                    DIVINE G
          Trust the process.

They watch them scramble onstage.

                    DIVINE EYE
          You got any kids?

Divine G is surprised by the question.

                    DIVINE G
          Two girls and a boy.

                    DIVINE EYE
          What are their names?

                    DIVINE G
          You're all up in my business
          today...

Divine G pauses a moment. As if the memories are painful to
touch.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Divequa, Dinasia, and Karron.
          Karron was just born when I came in
          here. But he's the only one who
          still writes me. He's getting into
          acting, of all things. Been making
          these little movies, putting them
          on that youtube.

                    DIVINE EYE
          You don't write your girls?

                    DIVINE G
          ... They don't... I don't want to
          bother them. They're trying to live
          their lives. We think we're the
          only ones in a prison, but they're
          locked up in here with us. In their
          own way.

Divine Eye watches the action onstage.
                    DIVINE EYE
          When I started my bid, my boy was
          young, but he was taken care of.
          The brothers I used to roll with,
          they looked after him. I mean
          rolled out the red carpet for him
          wherever he went. Treated him like
          a prince. Before long, he was doing
          the same work I was. Now he's
          wearing greens. Just like his old
          dad.

Divine G is quiet now.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          I feel different in here. If I'd
          had this on the outside, I'd've
          done something else, I know it. I
          wouldn't be in here. And he
          wouldn't be in here either.

Divine Eye stands up to leave.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          Keep writing your girls, man. Don't
          matter if they write back or not.

Divine G sits with that. Someone on stage yells for a line
reading. Divine Eye chuckles.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          At least I'm not the only one.

                    DIVINE G
          There's a trick to that, you know.

Divine Eye is quiet a moment, as if maybe he didn't hear him.

                    DIVINE EYE
              (finally)
          What's the trick?


INT. REC ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

Divine G lays his script across a table. It's got notes all
over it, more notes than lines.

                       DIVINE EYE
          Holy shit.

                    DIVINE G
          You can't memorize your lines until
          you know what they mean.
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Gotta get down under them.
          Paraphrase, whatever you've got to
          do to understand what they're
          actually saying. Then...

Divine G pulls out a ROLL OF PAPER. He's taped a bunch of
paper together to make one long scroll. It's filled with
writing.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Then you write. Write all your
          scenes without punctuation. In one
          long sentence. Write your lines and
          write your scene partners' lines.
          It's a mess but trust me.
              (moving down the scroll)
          Then, a week later, start taking it
          down in blocks. Then scenes. Pretty
          soon you're running the whole thing
          in your head. Then out loud. And
          then... Only then can you really
          start to play with it. Then you can
          be present in the moment.

Divine Eye looks lost.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          The point is to make it digestible.
          You do it the same way you eat an
          elephant. One bite at a time.
          Here...

Divine Eye pulls another roll of paper from his stack of
things. He gives it to Divine Eye.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Made one for you.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Thanks. What are those big ones?

                    DIVINE G
          Ah these...

Divine G rolls five posters out. Bigger than the rolls of
paper, each intricately covered in writing. Divine Eye leans
over the table trying to make sense of the maze.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          My lists. Got one for the day. One
          for the week. The month. The year.
          Five years...
                    DIVINE EYE
          Bro. I've met serial killers that
          weren't this organized.

Divine G laughs.

                    DIVINE G
          Helps me fight the slow time.

Divine Eye looks closer at the lists. We drift closer to the
writing. To a series of legal goals, surrounded by a calendar
date.

                    DIVINE EYE
          What's that one?

                    DIVINE G
          The most important one. Other than
          the play. Got a parole hearing
          coming up. A clemency hearing.

Divine Eye thinks.

                    DIVINE EYE
          They say you found a tape. Proving
          you're innocent.

                    DIVINE G
          Took me ten years. But yes.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Well then you got the golden goose.
          I don't even have to say good luck.

                    DIVINE G
          We'll see... Do you feel prepared
          for your date?

Divine Eye is quiet.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I saw the docket. I don't want to
          get in your business, but to be
          successful you have to--

                    DIVINE EYE
              (quick)
          I'm good man. I've gotta take care
          of some business. Thanks for the
          help.

Divine Eye starts to leave.
                       DIVINE G
             Hey.

Divine Eye stops.

                       DIVINE G (CONT'D)
                 (holds out the paper)
             Forgot this.

Divine Eye thanks him, takes the paper and leaves.


INT. THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

ONSTAGE, the actor playing ALOTINCOMMON is walking through
the MEDIEVAL ENGLAND set. A PEASANT appears, says a joke, and
DIES.

More peasants appear and as soon as they see the dead peasant
they die too.

Brent hops onstage.

                       BRENT
             OK OK OK. Umm... We're too
             restrained. Too stiff. This is
             supposed to fly off the rails.

He thinks.

                       BRENT (CONT'D)
             Everyone on stage.
                 (sees hesitation)
             Let's go. Everyone.

The cast steps up on stage, Divine G bringing up the rear.

                       BRENT (CONT'D)
             Pair up. We're going to do a little
             exercise.

As Divine G finally gets to stage, only one other person
doesn't have a partner: Divine Eye.

Divine G ambles over to him. Without saying a word they agree
to PAIR UP.

                       BRENT (CONT'D)
             OK. I want you to die for each
             other. There's no right way, no
             wrong way, anyway you want, the
             only rule is... you have to make
             your partner laugh. Let's go.
Some of them start dying immediately. Others are less sure.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Don't overthink it, just follow
          your instincts!

Divine Eye and Divine G stand there a moment awkwardly.

                    DIVINE G
          You want to go first?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Nah, let's see the pro in action.

Divine G nods. Seems to be thinking. Then suddenly he FREEZES
IN FAUX PAIN, he dies magnificently over-the-top like a
Victorian stage actor.

He falls to his knees and slumps.

When he looks up, Divine Eye is smiling.

                    DIVINE G
          Not bad, huh?

                    DIVINE EYE
          You know when somebody tells a joke
          so bad, that you have to laugh at
          just how bad it is?

                    DIVINE G
          Oh come on. I threw a little
          Laurence Olivier in there.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I never met him. Where's he doing
          his bid?

                    DIVINE G
          OK smartass, show me how it's done
          then.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Alright then, I just have to--

Divine Eye starts choking, gasping for air but none comes.
It's hyper-realistic, veins popping out on his neck. Not
funny at all.

Then he lets out a long fart and starts laughing
hysterically.

Divine G can't help but crack up.
                     DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          Got you!

                    DIVINE G
          You can't use props though, that's
          cheating.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I didn't hear Brent say that in the
          rules. Hey Brent! Did you say
          anything about props?

                    BRENT
              (across the room)
          What?!

                    DIVINE G
          Nevermind that. You can cheat.
          Check this.

Divine G starts miming. It's flawless. He's pulling a rope,
hoisting a piano high into the air. Then something catches
his eye. He watches a passersby, waves, and the piano falls
and crushes him dead.

Divine Eye laughs.

                     DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Ah hah!

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'll give you that one. Reminded me
          of my corny uncle.

                    DIVINE G
          Nuh uh. You're just playing it
          cool. You loved it.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Whatever. But do you know how to
          die like this--

Divine Eye stabs an imaginary blade into Divine G's belly.
Divine G dies spectacularly.

Then Divine G, from the ground, pulls the pin from an
imaginary grenade and it explodes at Divine Eye's feet.
Divine Eye flies off his feet.

We move back now and watch the whole company try to one-up
each other in a "die off". Noble deaths. Vengeful deaths.
Cowardly deaths. Playing like kids.
INT. THEATER - LATER

Divine Eye finishes his monologue but it lands flat, lacking
conviction. Brent watches him.

                    BRENT
          Want to try it again?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Why? Did I do something wrong?

                    BRENT
          Let's just try something.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Long as you don't say anything
          about eating any fucking elephants.

                     BRENT
          I don't know what that means, but I
          won't... OK. Let's start at the
          beginning.

                    DIVINE EYE
          With my first line?

                    BRENT
          No no no. To before you even walk
          onstage. Go to the wing, then step
          into the scene.

Divine Eye looks around.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Go ahead. Let's see it.

Divine Eye sighs. Then trudges off. Comes back in and stands
on his mark.

Brent looks confused.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          Sorry, did you do it already? I
          fell asleep.

The company laughs.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          You're stepping onstage like you
          need permission to be here. If you
          have that mindset, you can't flow.
          You have to take the stage. Show
          the audience it's time to pay
          attention to you.
Divine Eye tries again. It's a little better.

Divine G steps onstage.

                    DIVINE G
              (to Brent)
          May I?
              (to Divine Eye)
          Think about it this way. The world
          out there expects men like you and
          me to walk through a door cowering.
          To bow our head. To feel like we
          don't belong. But not in here. In
          here you're Divine fucking Eye.

Divine G demonstrates.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Walk in big. Like when you step out
          into the yard. Say I'm fuckin here.
          This is my fucking theater!

Divine G nods to him to try it.

Divine Eye steps off. This time he comes back in big.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I'M FUCKIN HERE.

                    DIVINE G
          THIS IS MY FUCKIN THEATER.

                    DIVINE EYE
          THIS MY FUCKIN THEATER!!

                    DIVINE G
          That's how you do it. Alright.
          Now. Where are you going. How do
          you leave the scene. Emotionally...

                      DIVINE EYE
          I'm mad.

                      DIVINE G
          Mad. Why?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Cause Maid Marion left me for him.
          I gave her this rock to remember
          me. And she threw it out like
          garbage.
                    DIVINE G
          But anger. That's easy. It's the
          easiest thing to play. You go big,
          you scream, and wow, he's angry.

Divine G steps close.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          You wanna go deeper. Try playing
          hurt. Hurt makes you look in. Makes
          you name it.

Divine G steps offstage. Divine Eye is lost in thought. His
mind running. Inspired.

                    BRENT (O.C.)
          Let's run it from the top!

                                                  CUT TO:

MONTAGE OF THE PLAY COMING TOGETHER:

Divine G and Divine Eye and other men from the company
rehearse throughout the prison.


INT. REC ROOM - LATER

The group is rehearsing lines from their play as a group as
camera moves around them.


INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

- Rehearsing between cells after lights out.


INT. MESS HALL - DAY

- Rehearsing across trays at chow.


EXT. WEIGHT POUND - DAY

- Rehearsing between reps at the weight pound.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

Brent is fielding a barrage of questions about creative
choices.
                    DAP
          This isn't an Egyptian headband,
          it's clearly Phoenician.

                    BRENT
          Hmm. We'll take a look at that.
          Check with props.

The actor playing Coal steps up holding his script.

                    BIG E
          Brent. Brocolli? I need a six
          shooter. Make it cardboard. Paint
          it in crayons. What am I supposed
          to do with broccoli? No one's gonna
          buy it.

                    BRENT
          It's funny. They're expecting a six-
          shooter. Make em expect a six-
          shooter. Then give em broccoli.

The actor doesn't totally buy it. Then the man playing Freddy
Krueger approaches, tense.

                    JJ
          We've got a serious issue here. The
          RTA principles are not clear in my
          character. And if I don't have a
          motivation and a moral, we'll undo
          everything we've been fighting for.

                    MIKE MIKE
          You're Freddy Krueger dude. Your
          motivation is slicing people up.

                    BRENT
          The moral is in the mummy.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. THEATER / ONSTAGE

One of the stage crew is on ladder rigging a light. Divine
Eye below him standing on his mark.

The stage crew turns it on, but the spot is off by a foot.

                    STAGE CREW (O.S.)
          Can you skooch a tad to the right,
          Eye?
                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm on my mark. Why don't you
          skooch your fuckin light?

The stage crew looks to Brent.

                    BRENT
          We can move the mark a little.

Divine Eye is silent a moment, like he might fight it.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Alright, let's move the mark.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

Brent is with Divine G, Mike Mike and a few other men. He
speaks to them quietly.

                    BRENT
          The Superintendent has some big
          money out in the seats. Money that
          can buy us curtains. We need to
          melt their faces off with this
          fight scene.

                    MIKE MIKE
          We got this.

                    BRENT
          Make it savage.


INT. THEATER / ONSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

They jog onstage to find the Superintendent with WOMEN FROM A
LOCAL CHURCH.

Brent looks to the men. Too late to back out.

Divine G and Mike Mike engage in mortal gladiatorial combat,
moving in slow motion. Stabbing each other with fake swords.
Brent glancing nervously between the women and the scene
unfolding.

They finish and bow to polite clapping from their guests. The
Superintendent walks the women out.

                    BRENT
          Don't worry guys. We can figure it
          out without curtains.

Moments later, The Superintendent returns, shaking his head.
                    SUPERINTENDENT
          I can't believe you chose that
          scene. But... they loved it.


INT. THEATER - ANOTHER DAY

Lunch is brought to the theater so the men can keep
rehearsing.

Divine Eye and Divine G are off to the side in their own row.

Divine Eye is pushing the sad looking meal around with his
fork.

                    DIVINE G
          Need a line reading?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Huh?

                    DIVINE G
          Nothing. Bad joke. You OK?

Divine Eye looks for how to say it.

                     DIVINE EYE
          It's just, Hamlet bro. That
          soliloquy.
              (looks for the words)
          My slings and arrows are on the
          inside. And all this make believe
          ain't gonna change that. If they
          stamp my ticket and crack those
          gates... I'm still a fucking
          gangster. Jail house college
          doesn't change that. Theater ain't
          gonna change it. It's my destiny.
          It was always waiting for me. It's
          like Hamlet, all he wants is Maid
          Marion and he's going to try and
          take on the whole Roman Empire, but
          to what end?

Divine G looks confused a moment.

                    DIVINE G
          I forget how different this version
          of Hamlet is. But listen. That's
          not what I see. You're an artist.
          You always have been.
                    (MORE)
                     DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          This isn't turning you into
          something else, it's revealing the
          parts of you that have been hidden.
          Let it. Let it strip all that other
          shit away.


INT. ONSTAGE - ANOTHER DAY

Everyone is now lined up onstage.

                    BRENT
          Some of you have expressed that a
          traditional curtain call is not in
          the spirit of Mummy's Code.

Brent looks around the company.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          So instead of a bow... we're gonna
          dance. Keys... hit it.

Keys presses play on a boombox in the wings. A CD whirls to
life. Music pulses through the dusty speakers.

No one wants to make the first move.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Fuck it. Let's roll.

Divine Eye starts to move. And like a wave the room bursts
into motion.

The whole cast starts dancing, freestyling down the line.

Motion slows, and score overtakes the track. Swelling with
emotion as the men dance with unbridled joy.



INT. THEATER - LATER

Score continues as the sets are unveiled.

The men push each other around in a ROMAN CHARIOT. Wielding
cardboard swords.

Two long-cut boards are brought in, painted like WAVES ON THE
SEA.

They layer the boards and stand on either end, pulling them
back and forth to make it look like ROLLING WAVES, endless
open ocean.
Everyone is in awe as they watch. Transported.


INT. THEATER - LATER

Divine Eye takes the stage with confidence. The whole company
surrounds the stage watching.

He finds his mark.

Divine G and Mike Mike are on pins and needles with the rest.
Divine Eye starts the soliloquy.

It's flawless. Everyone leaning forward as he nears the end.

But he stumbles on the very last line.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Perchance... Perchaaaance--

Divine Eye reaches out his fist, like he's grabbing for the
last line. But he only catches air.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
              (smiling)
          --aaand there it went.

They all come around him, razzing him and celebrating his
progress. Brent gives him a hug.

                    BRENT
          Very close. And very good. One more
          time from the top?


EXT. YARD - ANOTHER DAY

Divine G is walking the yard, slowly around the perimeter,
deep in thought. He has a folder under his arm.

He sees Divine Eye standing off by himself. He approaches
him.

                    DIVINE G
          Hey. Been waiting for you. Spin the
          yard with me?

Divine Eye follows him and they start walking the path
together.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I know you haven't had a lot of
          time to prep for your parole board
          hearing.
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I don't want to step on your toes,
          but I know you've been busy with
          the play -- I remember how much it
          was my first year -- so I did a
          little prep work for you.

He hands Divine Eye the folder. Divine Eye opens it.

                    DIVINE EYE
          What did I say the last time we
          talked about this?

                    DIVINE G
          I did what I could on the forms,
          you'll just need to fill in the
          addresses and all that. And write
          your essay. The other stuff is just
          a template. You'll need to put it
          in your own words to--

Divine Eye closes the folder. Stops them.

                     DIVINE EYE
          How can you stand here and have all
          this faith in the system? The
          system that put you here. The
          system that won't let you out, even
          with what you have. I got none of
          that and--

                    DIVINE G
          Are you telling me they got you?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Who got me?

                    DIVINE G
          They've got you convinced that you
          belong in here. That this is where
          you're supposed to be--

                    DIVINE EYE
          --That ain't it--

                    DIVINE G
          --and now you can act tough and say
          you're not going to prepare but
          that's what's real, isn't it? They
          got you fooled.

Divine Eye looks around. He's trying to hold in his emotions.
                    DIVINE EYE
          What do I got out there? Got no
          real family to speak of. All my
          friends are in here. Even my son is
          in here. Shit. I've been in so
          long, I don't even know what I'd do
          if they let me out. Maybe this
          is...

                    DIVINE G
          Don't say it. They want you to say
          it. But you're not a lap dog,
          you're a fucking wolf.

They start walking again.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          How we see the world is how it's
          delivered to us.

                    DIVINE EYE
              (slowly)
          If I try and they don't let me
          out...

                    DIVINE G
          Then you try again on the next one.
          It doesn't change who you are or
          where you're supposed to be.

Divine Eye opens the folder. Looks at the papers.

                    DIVINE EYE
          How long does the essay need to be?

                    DIVINE G
          There's no limit. Three to five
          pages is a good length, from my
          research.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I heard sometimes they don't even
          tell you their decision. You just
          wait.

                    DIVINE G
          They always send a letter. If it's
          a thick letter, you didn't get it.
          But if it's thin, just one sheet of
          paper... then you're free. Thick as
          a brick, or light as a feather.

Divine Eye takes all this in.
INT. DIVINE G'S CELL - NIGHT

Divine G and Mike Mike are talking across their cells. Just
sharing stories and chatting.

Mike Mike shares a story about growing up in the Bay, talking
about his childhood. Divine G is listening, laughing.

It reminds Divine G of his youth. He starts talking about his
time at the FAME school. How he danced ballet.

                    MIKE MIKE
          Ballet? Are you joking?

                    DIVINE G
              (laughs)
          Shut the fuck up. I loved it.
          There's no room for lies in ballet.
          Everything is direct, every
          movement is necessary.
              (gets quiet)
          I couldn't tell my friends about--

Silence from Mike Mike.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Hey. You fall asleep on me again?

Still silence.


EXT. DIVINE G'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

                    DIVINE G (O.S.)
              (smiles)
          After I sat through your dumbass
          story.

He rolls over.

                    DIVINE G (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Good night, Mike Mike. You dick.


INT. DIVINE G'S CELL - NEXT MORNING

Divine G is laying on his side, staring at the wall. A sound
fills his space, coming from another cell: cleaning,
scrubbing, shoving contents into trash bags. He just stares
into space, a blank look on his face.

Through the portal in his door we see the source of the
noise: A JANITOR is cleaning out Mike Mike's cell while a CO
stands watch.
The janitor rips down photos, bags sheets and what little
clothing was left.

It's unceremonious. Efficient. Without regard for the life
that once occupied the room.


INT. THEATER - SOME TIME LATER

The whole cast sits in a big circle on the stage. Except for
ONE EMPTY CHAIR. Mike Mike's. We let them sit in silence for
a while. Taking in each face. Their grief.

Finally one of the men speaks up.

                    BIG E
          Man, I can understand a brother
          stringing up. I can understand a
          stabbing. But his brain just shut
          down...

                    PREME
          My dad died of an aneurism. One day
          he was fine, the next just... I
          found him leaned over the sink.
          Toothbrush still in his mouth.

They start to share stories about what Mike Mike did for each
of them.

Divine G tries to nod along and smile but its clear something
is breaking apart inside of him.

They promise to dedicate the show to Mike Mike. To find ways
to support his family in their grief.

The walls begin to tremble from the commuter train.


INT. THEATER - A LITTLE LATER

Divine G is stacking chairs again. Divine Eye comes beside
him to help.

Divine Eye stops stacking.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Do you want to talk about it?

                    DIVINE G
          Everything that needed to be said,
          got said. Right? Do you need to get
          anything off your chest?
                    DIVINE EYE
          I'm only asking because you didn't
          say much earlier and--

                    DIVINE G
              (sharp)
          What's that supposed to mean?

                    DIVINE EYE
          Look man. I didn't mean anything by
          it. I'm just saying, if you need--

                      DIVINE G
          I'm good.

Divine G realizes his tone. Softens a bit.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I gotta go write a dozen letters to
          his family tonight. So I need to
          finish up these chairs. Appreciate
          it.

Divine G steps away with three stacked chairs.


INT. REC ROOM - DAY

MONTAGE: THE NEXT FEW DAYS

We watch Divine G go through life, living in the slow time.

- Watching TV with other men in the common area.


EXT. YARD COURTYARD - DAY

- Divine G circles the courtyard. As he's been doing for
hours. And will continue to do.


INT. THEATER - LIGHTING BOOTH - DAY

- Divine G watches down on the rehearsals. The men onstage
are paired up and waltzing around part of the pirate ship
set.


INT. PAY PHONE - ANOTHER DAY

A singular PAY PHONE hangs on the wall. A long line of people
waiting to use it. Currently, Divine G is on a call, though
his mind seems far away.
                    DIVINE G
          ...No, that's not what I'm saying
          but--
              (listens)
          But you need to tell them that they
          can't talk to you like--
              (listens)
          I hear you, Mama, but--
              (listens, now frustrated)
          Well why are we even talking about
          then? If you don't want to do
          anything about it, then you're just
          wasting your time by--
              (listens, softens)
          I'm sorry, I just... No, I'm not
          nervous, I just want to have it
          done already. Maybe I'm a little
          nervous.
              (listens)
          Yes ma'am. I know. I'm just--
              (chokes up)
          I'm just ready to see you, Mama.
          I'm ready to come home.


INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING - DAY

Divine G sits in a room more befitting a congressman's office
than a prison.

THREE COMMISSIONERS sit in high-backed chairs. Thumbing
through his file.

They make him a wait a long time before speaking to him.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          Mr. Whitfield, this is a Clemency
          hearing for your conviction of
          murder in the second, for which you
          were convicted of 25 to life, as
          well as weapons possession, second
          and third, two counts on each, two
          to seven and five to 15
          respectively. The sentences are
          verdict by trial.

                    DIVINE G
          That's correct.
          LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
You have also served out your
sentence for criminal possession of
a controlled substance, third
degree, one to three year sentence
by plea.

          DIVINE G
Yes.

          LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
I'll note at the outset we were
able to acquire the sentencing
minutes, which will be considered
as well as your parole packet.

          DIVINE G
Did you also have time to review
the letter from the Jeffrey
Deskovic Foundation for Justice? I
received a letter saying there was
some issue with the timing of my
filing, but I sent it within the
submission window.

          LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
No, we have it here. I believe I
saw that. But before we get to
that, we've got to finish defining
what it is that we're talking
about. Now we're talking about the
March 25th, 88 homicide of Rudolph
Migliarese. He had been shot many
times in the head and body.
Correct?

          DIVINE G
As far as I understand.

          LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
And in terms of this offense you
have exhausted your appeals, you
had the Innocence Project look at
this, Legal Aid, you hired an
investigator. Apparently you've
raised other issues of
prosecutorial and police department
misconduct. And there were some...
    (reading)
...other exculpatory statements
made by another person that were
never given to you for your trial.
                    DIVINE G
          Harold Wesley exonerated me on the
          audio tape I submitted.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          But in the end your appeals were
          not successful.

                    DIVINE G
          To date. That's correct.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          You do understand that we cannot
          overturn or invalidate the
          conviction of this court? We can
          only take into consideration your
          assertions of innocence and the
          information presented to support
          your claims.

                    DIVINE G
          I understand.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          This tape that you submitted,
          supposedly proving your
          innocence...

                    DIVINE G
              (excited)
          Yes. Harold Wesley confessed to the
          crime on that tape. But it was
          buried, along with some other key
          evidence.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          Yes, that's part of the issue. It's
          been next to impossible for us to
          verify the authenticity of it
          because the person who made the
          tape is deceased. And we can't get
          the DA's office to return our
          calls.

Divine G is unsure how to respond.

                       DIVINE G
          I don't...

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          You understand that creates a
          complicated legal issue, don't you?
                    DIVINE G
          Well, yes, but I can't control--

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
              (barreling on)
          --Since you've been in custody
          you've been involved in numerous
          programs -- it's too long of a list
          to go over every one -- but I have
          a question about the theater
          program. You've been involved in
          that many years, have you not?

                    DIVINE G
          Yes. I'm one of the founding
          members of that program. I'm very
          proud of it.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          And what part do you play in that
          program? Actor, director...?

                    DIVINE G
          No I'm not a director. I'm on the
          Steering Committee, kind of the
          board that guides the direction of
          the program inside. And yes, I act.
          Usually a few roles per production.
              (growing more proud)
          It seems like just acting in a
          play, but it really opens up
          something inside these men --
          myself included -- that was closed
          off. We all learn to get closer in
          touch with our feelings.

                    LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          So are you acting at all during
          this interview?

The air goes dead. The other Commissioners stare at him.

                    DIVINE G
              (fumbling)
          Well I-- Well no, not here. Of
          course not. I mean this is-- This
          is coming from the heart. I hope
          that's the way it's being
          interpreted, it's coming from the
          heart. I just--
              (stops, takes a breath)
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          The program is designed to help
          individuals learn management skills
          and just, become better human
          beings. That's all I was trying to
          get across.

                     LEAD COMMISSIONER FERGUSON
          I read about the program. It's a
          good program. OK, any other
          questions from the board?
              (none)
          Well thank you for answering our
          questions, Mr. Whitfield. We'll
          take all this into account and
          deliver our decision in two weeks.

                    DIVINE G
          Thank you for the time. And thank
          you for the consideration.

The back door opens. Divine G hangs there a moment as if
there might be more to say. Then he fades out of the room.


INT. PACKAGE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Diving G checks his mail one afternoon. There's a LETTER.
From The Parole Board. It's THICK, HEAVY.

He immediately knows what it says without opening it. We read
it all over his face.


INT. THEATER / WINDOW - A LITTLE LATER

Divine G steps to the small window looking out at the
mountains. Someone else is already there, looking out: Divine
Eye.

He holds his own LETTER in his hand. A single page. PAROLE
GRANTED.

Divine G steps up next to him. Sees tears have been running
down Divine Eye's face. Divine G just looks out the window
and they both quietly stare out a while before speaking.

                    DIVINE G
          You're going home.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I can't believe it. It still
          doesn't feel real.
                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          What about yours man? Have you
          heard anything yet?

Divine G wants to do anything but stamp out Divine Eye's
enthusiasm right now. Struggling over whether to come clean.

He begins to say something, but his words catch in his throat
and he looks back out the window.

Divine Eye looks at his friend.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't be here without you,
          beloved. Thank you.

Divine G smiles. Thanks him without saying a word.

                    DIVINE G
          Come on. They're waiting for you.

They start walking back toward the theater.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          You know you don't have to carry
          that thing everywhere with you,
          right? They'll let you out even if
          you lose it.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I have to keep looking at it to
          make sure I read it right.


INT. THEATER - A LITTLE LATER

A SINGLE CUPCAKE is carried onstage where Divine Eye waits,
everyone gathered around him.

PRE-LAP: Audio of people telling stories of Divine Eye. The
stories continue as everyone congratulates him on getting
parole.

Divine G hangs back in the wings, watching it all.

After a few stories, Divine Eye speaks.

                    DIVINE EYE
          This, um, reminds me of something
          I read on the wall in the box. Got
          me through my longest stretch in
          there.
              (thinks a moment)
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          We the willing, led by the
          unknowing, have been doing the
          impossible for the ungrateful for
          so long, with so little, that now
          we are qualified to do anything
          with nothing.
              (considers the cupcake)
          I love yall man. Every one of you.
          Now come up here and get some of
          this. Everyone gets a taste, even
          if its just a little one.


INT. THEATER - DAY

ONER tracking backstage and frontstage as COSTUMES are
brought in by the program founder Katherine and the buzz is
palpable as everyone tries them on for the first time. The
outfits are eccentric. Outrageous.

Katherine jokes about the strange places she had to look to
find them but says its worth it seeing the men in them now.
Reminds them that every button and every zipper must be
accounted for.

Sets roll past us. Three men in a tree costume struggle to
walk together. Big E practices drawing his broccoli from his
belt. His scene partner a carrot.

We turn a corner as two of the female volunteers greet their
fellow cast like old friends.

We come to a rest on one of the new members wearing a gold
polyester suit, staring at himself in a mirror.

                    PETE
          I haven't worn a suit in fifteen
          years.

Divine Eye guides him away from the mirror.

                    DIVINE EYE
          OK, that's good. Can you move over
          toward the stage, brother? Lotta
          guys need to use this mirror.

We follow Pete around a corner to land on Divine G, standing
beside the curtain, alone in his gladiator outfit. Spinning a
wig in his hands.

                                                  CUT TO:
INT. ONSTAGE - LATER

The cast is onstage. Cheering as every set is shown off and
wheeled in.

We get a beautiful pep talk from Brent. This is the final
dress rehearsal before opening night. He thanks the men for
trusting the process, for trusting him to be part of it.

We now drift across the stage as MOMENTS FROM THE PLAY
UNFOLD.

Throughout these moments WE TRACK DIVINE G as his mind seems
elsewhere.


INT. THEATER - ANCIENT EGYPT SET

The Egyptian Set is wheeled in. The prince does his Egyptian
slide across the stage. Two Egyptian guards stand beside
Mummy in her sarcophagus.


INT. THEATER - WHISKERANDOS TOWER

Leslie, Maid Marion, and a companion walk in place as
Whiskerandos Tower is wheeled closer. Tower is turned and
reveals Whiskerandos, He says his big line.

A remote controlled car brings a clue to their next
destination.


INT. THEATER - FREDDY KRUEGER

The growing shadow puppet of Freddy Krueger looms closer.


INT. THEATER - HAMLET

We enter this scene after Divine Eye finishes his soliloquy.
Now we see the bizarre turns that Mummy's Code has in store
for us.


INT. THEATER - PIRATE SHIP SCENE

Focus on the entrance of the bathtub sailing across the sea,
the pirate ship entering the stage opposite.

We cut to Leslie and Maid Marion waltzing across the sea.
Then the pirates in Hawaiian shirts pair off and join them.
INT. THEATER - LATER

DIVINE G'S SCENE IN THE GLADIATOR COLISEUM IS UP.

He enters the stage with three others. He gives his line
reading, fast and flat.

                    DIVINE G
          Zakariedies has got me locked into
          a 25 year no-pay contract. If I
          don't stay and be his number one
          gladiator, he's gonna kill my wife
          and daughters and feed me to the
          lions.

The timing throws his scene partner, who stumbles. Then asks
for his line.

Brent starts to read the line, but Divine G railroads them.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
              (to first actor)
          You say, We sure could'a used you
          for some serious backup. Then I
          say, Hey, well never fear,
          Gladiator Goliathon is here. I'll
          smash `em, I'll bash `em, whether
          short or tall. Then,
              (to second actor)
          You say, Why, you're just the kind
          of person we need. You could be our
          bodyguard, and hopefully you've at
          least been rehearsing,
              (turning to the theater)
          And then I cap it off by moving up
          and saying the profound line, Look,
          if you can help me escape, consider
          it done. And that's the end of Act
          IV.

Divine G looks out into the empty seats.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Oh yes, and remember, it's a
          comedy. So say it BIG! Say it
          merry! Be HAPPY!

It's dead silent in the theater.

                    BRENT (O.S.)
          Um. Why don't we take five and--
                    DIVINE G
          Why? It's not going to help. More
          time and more time, if we don't
          have it now, we're not going to get
          it, don't you all understand that?
          Don't you get that?

Divine Eye steps onstage. Leans in quietly.

                    DIVINE EYE
          C'mon bro. Let's take a walk.

                    DIVINE G
              (snaps)
          Get the fuck away from me!

He and Divine Eye stare at each other. Everyone in the cast
and crew is frozen.

The Divine G relaxes.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          See? Anger is easy to play.

He looks out to the whole company.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          What the fuck are we doing here?
          These silly fucking outfits.
          Dancing around, for what? So we can
          do it all over again in six months?
          Working our asses off. We kill
          ourselves just to get permission to
          paint cardboard and then what?

The others are looking down, shaking their heads,
disappointed in him, but no one stops him.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          We're just entertaining ourselves.
          Dancing for them while they warm up
          the chair. That's the real fucking
          joke.

                      DIVINE EYE
          You done?

Divine G sighs, holding back tears, looks around.

                    DIVINE G
          No. I'm not.
              (long pause)
          Isn't that hilarious?
Divine G walks off the stage into the darkness until it
envelopes him whole.

In the void a door slams shut.


INT. THEATER - DAY

SING SING - VARIOUS

A series of shots of EMPTY SPACES throughout the prison:

- The THEATER. The stage filled with props, but dark and
empty.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

- A CLASSROOM. Filled with chairs, the lights out.


EXT. YARD - DAY

- The YARD. Wind blowing the dirt around. Little wrens
searching for scraps.


INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

The entire cast sits in a circle of chairs. The conversation
is chaotic, everyone talking over each other. The subject:
Divine G leaving.

Divine Eye sits in a chair at the edge, barely in the circle.

Brent is here too, mostly listening.

The cast is talking about Divine G, mostly talking shit about
him leaving them. Saying he betrayed them, betrayed the show.

Then someone's voice cuts through.

                       DINO
          Hey!

They all stop, turn to him. Dino focuses on one of them.

                    DINO (CONT'D)
          You love this program? You're
          protective of it? How did you get
          in here?

The man doesn't answer, just looks down.
                    DINO (CONT'D)
              (to another)
          And what about you? You were
          running meth through the yard, if I
          remember right. And he fought for
          you to be in this program. When
          some of us didn't think you should
          be in here, to be honest.
              (to them all)
          Everyone has a breaking point, no
          matter how strong they are.

                    JJ
          So does that mean the rules don't
          apply to him? We have clear
          protocols in place for this.

Everyone gets quiet. Divine Eye says nothing. Just observes.

After awhile, Brent speaks. Softly from the side.

                    BRENT
          I remember my first time directing
          a production in here. I decided all
          the roles, who would get what
          parts. It's how you do it on the
          outside, the director decides. Then
          I brought that list in and Divine G
          pulled me aside and said, that's
          not how we do it here. We decide
          together.

Brent smiles. A few smile with him.

Brent thinks.

                    BRENT (CONT'D)
          When the towers fell, I was so
          worried about you guys. I called
          all my friends, a few family
          members, but I couldn't call you. I
          couldn't make sure you were ok. The
          second they let us in I came back
          and Divine G was the first person I
          saw. I cried at the sight of him.
          He just pulled me in and let me get
          it all out. Then he said, you good?
          I said, yeah I think so. He said,
          OK, well get your shit together. I
          don't need you worrying the others.

They all laugh. Then it gets quiet again.

Divine Eye stands and walks out of the room.
INT. MESS HALL - ANOTHER DAY

Divine Eye sits by himself, eating silently, full of
questions.

Someone walks across behind him, DROPS A WAD OF CASH on the
table by his tray. Divine Eye instinctively hides it under
his tray.

He looks up to see who has passed. Clay.

The young man he extorted crosses the room and sits with a
GROUP OF HARD-LOOKING MEN. He's accepted into their ranks.

He looks across the room at Divine Eye. The young man looks
ten years older. It seems to have cost him a lot to get this
money.

He nods to Divine Eye. A moment of recognition.


INT. DIVINE EYE'S CELL - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS of Divine Eye's cell. Stacked cans of soup. Air
Jordans. Ramen for days. A wealth amassed over the years.

But not the wealth Divine Eye longs for any longer.

Divine Eye sits at his desk. Lit by a single desk lamp.

After a while he pulls out his script. Opens it to his first
scene. He starts mumbling, rehearsing his lines.


INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

Divine Eye is back with the rest of the cast.

Brent starts a warmup. He asks everyone to close their eyes.
He has them IMAGINE A FRIEND. Anyone they would like to see
who they haven't in a long time.

                    BRENT
          Now hold that face in your mind.
          And open your eyes.

A man in street clothes stands there, smiling. This is
CHARLIE.

                    CHARLIE
          Did it look like me?
They group explodes with excitement, everyone jumps up,
hugging Charlie.

                                                  CUT TO:


A LITTLE LATER.

Charlie sits in the circle with them. Telling a story.

He talks about what it felt like to go home. The first meal
he ate. The first person he saw.

Slowly, he becomes more vulnerable. He talks about his
struggles since going home. How hard it is to take the mask
off that sustained him in here. How he forgot how to accept
love.

                    CHARLIE
              (looking for the words)
          I've been talking to a counselor
          and she says, you know, I might
          have the, uh, the PT...

                    CARMINE
              (softly)
          PTSD.

Charlie nods. Tears in his eyes.

                    CHARLIE
          I miss yall is all. I feel like my
          family is in here and I'm just...

He starts to choke up. Has to stop.


                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
              (collecting himself)
          Ah shit. Brent asked me to come in
          here and pump you up before the big
          show and look at me.

They all laugh with him.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Maybe, uh, maybe we can do a
          exercise. Just cut it up a little.
          Would that be OK?

                    BRENT
          Yeah. Definitely. Let's all get up
          on our feet. Stop sitting around
          like a sewing circle.
They all get on their feet and Brent starts describing the
exercise.


EXT. YARD / STAIRCASE - AFTERNOON

Divine Eye sees Divine G across the yard, sitting on some
stairs. Watching the Hudson River. The town beyond the river.
People going home.

Soon he crosses the yard and sits quietly with him.

After a while the passenger train goes through the yard.

Divine Eye lets the silence settle back in before he knows
what to say.

                    DIVINE EYE
          You know, I lied when I came into
          the program. I said I didn't know
          what those plays were and I just
          wanted to talk to the chicks and
          all that. I mean, I did want to
          talk to chicks, but I knew about
          the plays. I was artistic, you
          know. When I was a kid.

Divine G is listening.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          I painted. Drew a lot. Anytime my
          mom's friends were sick, she'd have
          me draw a card for them. Or paint
          something. But I was always, you
          know, I didn't look like an artist.
          So other plans were set for me.
          When I got to be like twelve, I
          didn't draw any more. My moms was
          always asking why don't you draw
          something for me and I just... I
          wasn't nice about it.

Divine Eye gets quiet, looks around the yard. His world here.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          I was out here in the yard one day,
          couple years back, and it starts
          pouring rain, so they shut it down.
          But I had some business to do. So I
          go to the theater, did what I had
          to do, then I just sat there,
          nowhere else to be. But all you
          cats were putting on a play.
                    DIVINE G
          Which one was it?

                    DIVINE EYE
          The one with the... guys in the
          asylum--

                    DIVINE G
          Cuckoo's Nest. Not a comedy.

                    DIVINE EYE
              (smiles at that)
          Nope. But here's what it was. See,
          before that day, I thought I was
          free. I did whatever I wanted. I
          was a wolf. But I saw you up on
          stage, crying over someone who
          died, and I realized, I ain't free.
          I wear a mask. Every day. All of us
          do. Except for you. And I needed
          that. I watched every play you were
          in after that. I got on the waiting
          list and I spent a whole year
          getting no tickets, just so I could
          know what that felt like.

Divine G doesn't know how to respond.

                    DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
          You don't know how to ask for help.
          And you don't trust it when it's
          offered. But you need it. Just like
          the rest of us. You just have to
          ask for it.

                    DIVINE G
          I knew you were lying about that
          too. I never forget a face out in
          that crowd.

                    DIVINE EYE
              (laughs)
          Yeah right.

They watch the geese float over the river.

                    DIVINE G
          I fucked up.

                     DIVINE EYE
          You did.

Divine Eye lets that hang.
                        DIVINE EYE (CONT'D)
             But the thing is, everyone in RTA
             took a vote. They know you. They
             know that wasn't you. You would be
             welcome back. On just one
             condition.

                       DIVINE G
             What's that?

                       DIVINE EYE
             You gotta admit that I absolutely
             crushed that soliloquy. Like,
             Shakespeare himself rolled around
             in his grave just a little so he
             could hear what I was bringing to
             it.

Divine G laughs.

                       DIVINE G
             You did. You did, my beloved.


INT. THEATER - EVENING

BACKSTAGE.

The cast is in a tight huddle.

Divine G looks across the cast. They look him back at him,
waiting for him to say something.

                       DIVINE G
             I thought I was stronger. And uh...
             I'm just grateful for this family.

And everyone understands this. They nod. Welcome him back.

Then one actor starts a chant that the others soon join.

                       ALL
                 (starting quiet)
             Energy. Energy. Flowing through my
             body.
                 (a little louder)
             Energy. Energy! Flowing through my
             body.

The circle is now alive, swaying back and forth. Splitting
off and dancing.
                    ALL (CONT'D)
          ENERGY! ENERGY!! FLOWING THROUGH MY
          BODY!!!

                                                  CUT TO:

ONSTAGE. LATER. JUST BEFORE SHOWTIME.

The stage crew is shepherding in the sets for the first
scene.

Divine G and Divine Eye stand on stage, on their marks. The
curtain closed before them. Props around them.

They are still. Ready.

The din of the audience falls to a hush. A quietness shot
through with anticipation.

The Divines share one last look. A fleeting moment.

And then...

The curtains open to a WASH OF LIGHT.

A roar of applause.

                                           WASH TO WHITE.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAYS LATER

Divine G is walking down the cellblock, escorted by a CO,
passing one cell after another. Each a little microcosm,
showing the life of the person inside.

                    CO
          Yall were pretty good out there the
          other night.


INT. DIVINE EYE'S CELL - A LITTLE LATER

Divine Eye's cell is completely empty. He sits on his cot in
there.

Divine G smiles when he sees him, leans on the bars.

                    DIVINE G
          They let me come down and say
          goodbye. Still waiting?
                     DIVINE EYE
          Been the longest two days of my
          whole bid.

                    DIVINE G
          I've heard that.
              (of the cell)
          You cleaned out.

                    DIVINE EYE
          I didn't have that much to start
          with. Sorry I didn't have nothing
          to give you. I didn't feel like I
          had nothing good enough.

                    DIVINE G
          You've given me plenty.

They sit with that a moment.

                    DIVINE EYE
          This ain't goodbye, you know. I'll
          see you out there before long.

                    DIVINE G
          Nah...

                    DIVINE EYE
          Come on man. Don't get all, what'd
          you call it, fatalistic. Don't bum
          me out on my last day in here.

                    DIVINE G
          Nah, It's not like that. I'm good.
          Here. Whatever that means.

Divine G is thoughtful a moment.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I had a little brother, Jeffrey. He
          had a, condition, it was
          congenital. His heart wasn't strong
          enough to pump blood around his
          body... looked all blue since I can
          remember. It was ironic because he
          was the biggest hearted person I
          ever met. He knew things too. From
          the time he was ten he started
          saying he was gonna die soon, that
          he wouldn't be with us long. He
          always said, Davey, don't worry
          mama when I'm gone. I used to get
          so fuckin mad at him but...
                    (MORE)
                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          it was just cause I was scared of
          what he was saying. Scared of
          losing him.

Divine G is quiet. Seems to be working out what he's trying
to say.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          I used to carry him to the park in
          the afternoons. The 260 park in
          Canarsie. He was a baseball fanatic
          so we'd go down to the five
          diamonds and watch the other kids
          play. I don't know anything about
          baseball but I'd just sit there and
          listen to him talk and talk. He saw
          all these intricacies of the game I
          just didn't see.
              (sighs)
          After I lost him... I didn't open
          up. I took care of people but I
          didn't really... I didn't want to
          lose somebody I was close to like
          that again.
              (looks at Divine Eye)
          I couldn't stand you when you came
          into the program. Couldn't stand
          the sight of you.

They both laugh at that.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Now I feel like I'm sitting on that
          bench again with him. Knowing he's
          going someplace better, but wishing
          so bad he'd just stay a little
          longer.

Divine Eye stands and they hug each other.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Alright get out of here.


INT. CLASSROOM - SOME TIME LATER

Another day. Divine G and three others of the Steering
Committee sit in a circle in the classroom. A few seats
remain empty.

Divine G sips his tea and makes a few notes. The others are
still buzzing from the play, talking about what a joy it was
to do a comedy.
                    JJ
          Yeah, but I thought a comedy would
          be a lot easier than that.

The others laugh and agree. A new Steering Committee member,
SUAREZ speaks up.

                    BIG E
          So what do we want to do next?

The room quiets. Divine G still isn't saying much.

Others start to throw out ideas: 12 Angry Men, The Seagull,
Jitney.

                    DAP
          What about one of Divine G's plays?

Everyone looks to Divine G. He isn't sure how to respond.

                    DAP (CONT'D)
          Do you have one that you want to
          do?

                    DIVINE G
          I don't know...

                    JJ
          Come on man. Wasn't there one about
          a music man or something?

                    DIVINE G
          Ah yeah. Fine Print. But that one
          still needs some work. Lost in the
          second act.
              (thinks)
          You know. I've got one that I wrote
          a couple years back that could fit.
          It's called Pro Se. It's about...

Divine G goes on describing the play.


INT. THEATER - DAY

Music begins as we see grainy DV CAM footage begin of:

SEVEN YEARS OF CURTAIN CALLS.

We see the end of play after play, moments of Divine G with
rotating casts, dressed in an array of costumes from
different eras and countries, all stepping out as the
curtains part to take their bow. Intercut with ACTUAL FOOTAGE
of RTA performances.
Again and again.


INT. DIVINE G'S CELL - ANOTHER DAY

SEVEN YEARS LATER.

Divine G sits alone in his cell, a box on his lap. Everything
else has been cleaned out.

On top of the box, A LETTER. LIGHT AS A FEATHER.

His GATE clangs open. He steps out, carrying his box, and
stands outside his gate, waiting for his CO escort.

He looks around. His eyes land on Mike Mike's old cell. A new
face looks out at him from it. A young man. They nod to each
other, a subtle moment of recognition.

Then the CO steps up beside Divine G and walks him away.


EXT. THE GATE - SOON AFTER

Divine G stands with his paper sack. A twenty foot steel gate
lumbers open.

He steps in a narrow passage between gates. His heart starts
to thunder in his chest.

A CO steps out of an office a clipboard. We watch their
interaction without words from the watchtower, high as a
bird.

The CO makes a note and signals to the gate man in the tower.

The second gate groans, opening on a neighborhood street.

Divine G takes his first steps of freedom. He has trouble
breathing.


INT. / EXT. PARKED SUV - DAY

Peering through a windshield, we see a little road that wraps
around the prison fence, layers of razor wire in the
background.

Soon, Divine G comes walking around the bend. We pan to see
the person leaned on the hood of the car, waiting for Divine
G. Divine Eye.
                    DIVINE EYE
          Was starting to get worried.
          Thought you had decided to stay.

                    DIVINE G
          I was just trying not to walk too
          fast. Didn't want them to see me
          running, think I was escaping and
          shoot me.

They laugh.


EXT. SING SING FENCE LINE - CONTINUOUS

Divine Eye meets G along the fence. They grab each other a
deep hug. Holding it for a while.

An expanse of prison and razor wire stretches out beyond
them.


INT. SUV / COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

A blur of green out the window. Divine Eye drives along a
road socked in with trees. Wind sings through the open
windows.

Divine G looks out. The movement is overwhelming.

                      DIVINE EYE
          You good?

Divine G looks for the words.

                    DIVINE G
          It's a lot, isn't it?

He looks over to Divine Eye. Divine Eye nods.

                    DIVINE G (CONT'D)
          Almost too much.

Divine G's emotions are welling up.

                    DIVINE EYE
          Just sit with it man. Sit with it.
          You've got plenty of time.

Divine G leans his head back by the open window. The trees
give way to open farmland. The breeze and the sunlight
crossing his face. He closes his eyes. Soaks it in.
And then his eyes open. To the new world.

                                            THE END.
