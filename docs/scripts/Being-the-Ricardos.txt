    FADE IN:

    We meet--individually--three people who are the older
    versions of three characters we'll meet shortly. They're
    speaking to an off-camera interviewer in three different
    locations that have been chosen, dressed and lit for a
    documentary.

                It was a scary week, `cause here's
                what you gotta understand. You
                gotta understand a hit television
                show--today--a big hit television
                show, what does it get? Ten-million
                viewers.

    We ID the man with a chyron--

                Let's go crazy and say fifteen.
                Fifteen-million viewers `cause this
                is a big, giant hit. Here's what
                you gotta understand. I Love Lucy?
                Sixty-million. Households.

    The tables are all set for dinner but the place is empty. BOB
    is sitting at a table near where a small orchestra would
    play.

                          OLDER BOB
                Oh yeah. It's been a long time, but
                I remember that week.

                That was a scary week. It was a
                very scary week.

                   Those guys scare too easy. I'm from
                   the Midwest. I lived through the
                   depression and the dust bowl so I
                   don't scare that easy.

                   week.

                   Now here's what you gotta
                   understand. Audience share. That's
                   the percentage of television sets
                   that are turned on--what percentage
                   are tuned to you. That's audience
                   share.

                   Out of the blue.

                              OLDER MADELYN
                   Everyone almost lost their jobs.
                   And Lucy and Desi, they almost lost
                   their lives.
                       (beat)
                   No exaggeration.

                              OLDER JESS
                    So we're getting our 60-million
                    households at a time when the
                    population of the United States was
                    155-million, many of whom did not
                    own television sets. Our audience
                    share was consistently in the 70's.
                    Today? Population 330-million. Your
                    big hit show with the 15-million
                    viewers, maybe 20 if someone's
                    getting married or killed, audience
                    share? EIGHT!

                    Just like that.

                              OLDER MADELYN
                    You're asking when did they find
                    out? At the same time as everyone
                    else, they were listening to Walter
                    Winchell.


11     INT. NIGHTCLUB - DAY                                  11

                              OLDER BOB
                    I'm minding my own business,
                    listening to Walter Winchell, and
                    bam--

                              OLDER MADELYN
                    At the end of the broadcast--


13     INT. SOUNDSTAGE BLEACHERS - DAY                       13

                              OLDER JESS
                    Department stores used to be open
                    late Monday nights, then they
                    switched to Thursday nights, you
                    know why? `Cause nobody was leaving
                    home during I Love Lucy on Mondays.

                 There was a significant drop-off in
                 the number of people using water
                 between 9 and 9:30 on Monday
                 nights. My point is, and this is
                 what you gotta understand, it
                 wasn't small potatoes when Winchell
                 ended his broadcast by saying--


14     INT. NIGHTCLUB - DAY                               14

                           OLDER BOB
                 Lucille Ball is a communist.
                     (pause)
                 Just like that. Lucille Ball is a
                 member of the Communist Party.


15     INT. SOUNDSTAGE BLEACHERS - DAY                    15

                              OLDER JESS
                 Yeah.

                           OLDER MADELYN
                 And she'd already seen the magazine
                 story about Desi when Winchell came
                 on. The magazine came out on
                 Mondays but her publicist brought
                 her a copy Sunday night.


17     INT. NIGHTCLUB - DAY                               17

                           OLDER BOB
                 What were they doing when they
                 first heard the news?


18     INT. SOUNDSTAGE BLEACHERS - DAY                    18

                           OLDER JESS
                 What were they doing?

                           OLDER MADELYN
                 I don't know what Lucy and Desi
                 were doing, but it was Lucy and
                 Desi, so they were either tearing
                 each other's heads off or tearing
                 each other's clothes off.

                                                          CUT TO:


20     INT. ARNAZ HOME/LIVING ROOM   - NIGHT                        20

       In the foreground--though out of focus--is the back of
       LUCILLE BALL, sitting on a couch with her bare feet up on a
       coffee table. She has a drink next to her and lights a
       cigarette.

       In the background--in clear focus-is an RCA RADIO/TURNTABLE
       CONSOLE as we HEAR an announcer--

                           ANNOUNCER (FROM THE RADIO)
                 It's time America...time for Walter
                 Winchell. Presented to you by
                 Gruen, the precision watch. Gruen,
                 the finest watch you can wear.
                 Gruen, the finest watch you can
                 give, brings you the man who gives
                 America the news...Walter Winchell
                 of the New York Daily Mirror and
                 the Washington Post.

       The broadcast continues as we HEAR the front door open. For
       the next minute or so we'll see no faces--just out-of-focus
       arms and legs and other shards of the moment as they pass
       through the frame, which remains on the radio--the only thing
       in focus.

                           DESI (O.S.)
                     (calling)
                 Lucy, I'm home!

                           LUCY (O.S.)
                 Where the hell have you been ya
                 Cuban dimwit?

                           DESI (O.S.)
                 Whoa, easy does it.

                           LUCY (O.S.)
                 You philandering bongo player.

                  I was playing cards with--


        We HEAR his face being SLAPPED--

                            DESI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Ow! Hey! I was playing cards with--

        SLAP--

                            DESI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Ow, Goddammit!

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  Tell me when it starts to hurt.


20A     A FEW MINUTES LATER--                                    20A

        We're on the radio again but from a different angle as the
        Winchell broadcast continues. Again, we won't see faces--just
        the occasional slice of someone coming into or out of the
        frame.

                            WALTER WINCHELL (FROM THE RADIO)
                  William L. Markey, Jr.,
                  Eisenhower's top backer in Buffalo,
                  is being divorced very quietly. His
                  wife--

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                  The boat?

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  We were playing cards on the boat.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  Since last night?! Since 27 hours
                  ago?!

                              DESI (O.S.)
                  Yes!

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  And you couldn't get to a phone?

                              DESI (O.S.)
                  No.

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                  Why?
                                                       7.
      Continued: 20A

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  I was passed out a lot of that
                  time!

20B     A FEW MINUTES LATER--                                    20B

        We're on the radio but from still a different angle and still
        no faces. The Winchell broadcast continues--

                            WALTER WINCHELL (FROM THE RADIO)
                  The Vice President, in a
                  magnificent speech this week, told
                  the American Legion why we--

        A copy of a magazine flies across the room and lands on the
        radio console. It's Confidential Magazine. There's a photo of
        Desi with a woman.

        "Desi's Wild Night Out" reads the headline.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  That's tomorrow's Confidential.

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  Why do you even read that magazine?

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  Why do I even--In this case it's
                  `cause my husband's on the cover
                  with another woman so it caught my
                  eye. The story chronicles a night
                  on the town with you and--

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  That's somebody's niece.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  What the hell do I care if--

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  From Westinghouse. That's the
                  Westinghouse corporate--you were
                  there--that's the guy's niece. That
                  picture was taken last summer.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  The story's about last Wednesday
                  night.

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  Last Wednesday night I was on the
                  boat.

            Like last night?

                      DESI (O.S.)
            Yes!

                      WALTER WINCHELL (FROM THE RADIO)
            --with the hall coming to its feet
            at the conclusion of his address.

  We see LUCY's hand pick up the magazine...

                      LUCY (O.S.)
                (pause)
            You're right. This was taken at the
            Westinghouse corporate retreat.

                      DESI (O.S.)
            Yes.

                       LUCY (O.S.)
                (beat)
            I apologize.

            Say, "Desi, I apologize for
            doubting you."

                      LUCY (O.S.)
            No.

                      DESI (O.S.)
            "For I see now that this picture
            was taken--not last Wednesday night-
            -but six months ago at the
            Westinghouse corporate retreat and
            I'll never doubt your love for me
            again." Say that.

                      LUCY (O.S.)
            No. And you're doing it again.
            You're pronouncing it Westin-gouse.

                      DESI (O.S.)
            It is Westin-gouse.

                      LUCY (O.S.)
            Westinghouse.

                      DESI (O.S.)
            Say g-h-o-s-t.

                      LUCY (O.S.)
            Ghost.

                  You don't pronounce an "H' after a
                  "G". Westin-gouse.

20C     A FEW MINUTES LATER--                                    20C

        We're on the radio from still a different angle. DESI and
        LUCY are pulling and tugging at each other's clothes on the
        couch.

                            WALTER WINCHELL (FROM RADIO)
                  When the G-Men captured the
                  fugitives in the High Sierras last
                  week--

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  So everything in the magazine was
                  made up?

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  I haven't read the magazine, but
                  unless the story's about me playing
                  cards on the boat--

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                  It's not.

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  --then yes, it's made up. Get it
                  through your head--you're the only
                  thing I want.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                  Well then you're an idiot.

                            DESI (O.S.)
                  I'm trying to get this off but I
                  think it's been welded.

                            WALTER WINCHELL (FROM RADIO)
                  The House Committee on Un-American
                  Activities is holding secret
                  sessions in California. The most
                  popular of all television stars was
                  confronted with her membership in
                  the Communist Party. And that, Mr.
                  And Mrs. 48, winds up another
                  edition until next Sunday night at
                  the very same--

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                  Wait.
                                                      10.
     Continued: 20A

                            DESI (O.S.)
                 Wait.

                            LUCY (O.S.)
                 Wait.

       And now we finally move up to see their faces--LUCILLE BALL
       and DESI ARNAZ like we've never seen them. LUCY, half-dressed
       with her red hair down and flying around her face and
       shoulders, DESI with his shirt ripped open, both of their
       faces flush and glistening with sweat. Their breathing is
       still heavy...

                           LUCY (CONT'D)
                     (pause)
                 What did he say?

                           DESI
                 He said the most popular of all
                 television stars was--

                           LUCY
                 --was confronted with her
                 membership in the Communist Party.

       The two of them just stare at the radio...

                           DESI
                     (pause)
                 Yeah.
                     (pause)
                 He coulda been talkin' about
                 Imogene Coca.

                           LUCY
                 Fuck you, he was not talking about
                 Imogene Coca.

22     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY                                        22

       20-odd people sit at a horseshoe of folding tables. They're
       the cast and staff of I Love Lucy and behind them is the
       iconic set from the show. The group is largely silent. They
       smoke their cigarettes, tap their scripts or just wait
       quietly and nervously. Two seats at the head of the table--
       reserved with a card for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, are
       conspicuously empty.

       A woman finally speaks up. The card in front of her reads
       "Vivian Vance". We may notice that Vivian is considerably
       more attractive in real life than she is when she's playing
       Ethel Mertz.

                            VIVIAN
                  This is nonsense.

       She lights a cigarette.

                            VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                  It's nonsense and it will get worse
                  before it gets better. Little Rusty
                  Hamer? When he signed his contract--
                  or the guardian, whoever signs the
                  contract for him--he had to sign a
                  loyalty pledge. Did anyone know
                  that?

       Nobody answers...

                             VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                  Bill?

       She's talking to WILLIAM FRAWLEY.

                             VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                  Bill.

                            FRAWLEY
                  Is she talking to me?

       Two of the elderly witnesses we saw in the opening, BOB and
       MADELYN, are now in their 20's.

                             MADELYN
                  Yes.
                                                 12.

                      FRAWLEY
            So she knows I'm here, she can see
            me?

                      MADELYN
            Yeah.

                      VIVIAN
            Did you know little Rusty had to
            sign a loyalty pledge?

                      FRAWLEY
            I don't know who the fuck little
            Rusty is.

                      VIVIAN
            Rusty Hamer from The Danny Thomas
            Show.

                      FRAWLEY
            That's not his name.

                      VIVIAN
            It is his name.

                      FRAWLEY
            The littlest kid on Danny's show?

                      VIVIAN
            Yes.

                       FRAWLEY
            The character's named Rusty, not
            the actor.

                      VIVIAN
            They're both named Rusty. Rusty
            Williams is played by Rusty Hamer.

                      FRAWLEY
            And Hamer's a Communist?

                      VIVIAN
            He's 7-years old.

                      FRAWLEY
            And he's interested in politics?

                      VIVIAN
            No imbecile! I'm saying he's 7-
            years old and they made him sign a
            loyalty pledge.

            Uh-huh.

                      VIVIAN
            This is getting out of hand was my
            point.

                      FRAWLEY
            Why isn't Danny Thomas's kid named
            Rusty Thomas?

                      VIVIAN
            Are you drunk?

                      FRAWLEY
            It's 10am, Vivian, so...you
            know...of course.

                      MADELYN
            Bob and Jess and I were up all
            weekend working on the script
            you're about to read and on behalf
            of all of us I want to say how much
            we appreciate your respect.

                      FRAWLEY
            Believe me, you do not want me to
            read this sober.

                      BOB
            I'm starting to get a little tired
            of your casual insults.

                      FRAWLEY
            Well my insults don't feel like
            putting on a fuckin' tuxedo for
            you, kid. Jess, why don't you tell
            your young writers that I don't
            work for them.

                      MADELYN
            Jess, why don't you tell your
            supporting cast that we don't work
            for him either.

  And now we finally hear from the younger version of JESS--

                      JESS
            You all work for me!
                (pause)
            Look, what you all have to
            understand is this. Here's what you
            have to understand. We're all
            tense.

       There's a long silence in the room before--

                           MADELYN
                     (pause)
                 Seriously, that was it?

                           JESS
                 We're all tense, and the cure for
                 that is to just do the show. Normal
                 production week.

                           FRAWLEY
                 We're going to need someone to play
                 Lucy and Ricky, those are critical
                 roles.

                           JESS
                 The two of them are in Desi's
                 office meeting with the network and
                 the sponsor right now. I'm sure
                 there's an explanation and that
                 this'll be over by show night.

                           FRAWLEY
                 One way or the other.

                           JESS
                 Yeah. No. I mean--let me be clear--
                 I said this'll all be over by show
                 night and Bill said, "One way or
                 the other." Gallows humor. I said,
                 "Yeah", but I didn't mean--

                           MADELYN
                 The sooner you stop talking--

                           JESS
                 Yeah.


23     INT. DESI'S OFFICE - DAY                                     23

       It's an office befitting the president of Desilu and right
       now it's filled with a half-dozen men plus Lucy and Desi.
       DESI's sitting at his desk and LUCY's leaning against it.

                           DESI

            Tip? If Winchell had it cold he'd
            have used her name, it woulda been
            at the top of the show and not the
            bottom and this morning we'd be
            reading about it on the front page
            of every paper, am I right?

            Can you see where CBS might be

                      DESI
            You don't want to talk to my wife
            like that, amigo.

                      LUCY
            My father died when I was very
            young and I was raised by my mother
            and my grandfather, a man named
            Fred C. Hunt.

                      DESI
            I'd like everyone but Howard to
            leave the room.

                      ROGER
            Philip Morris pays for this show.

                      DESI
            And they get their money's worth so
            give us a minute, would you?

  LUCY's taken a cigarette out--

                      ROGER
            She's smoking a Chesterfield, could
            she at least smoke one of the seven
            brands that Philip-Morris--

                      DESI
            Got it.

  Everyone's gone but LUCY, DESI and HOWARD...

                      LUCY
            Fred C. Hunt, my grandfather, was a
            member of the party. This was in
            the early 30's and I was in my
            early 20's. He never used the word
            "communist" but he cared about
            workers, the working man. He raised
            my little brother and me and I
            wanted to please him so I checked
            the box. Back then it wasn't
            considered much worse than being a
            Republican.

                      HOWARD
            Have you been to a meeting?

                      LUCY
            No.

                      HOWARD
            Never.

                      LUCY
            No.
                                                 17.

                      HOWARD
            You were at a cocktail party and
            later you found out--

                      LUCY
            No.

                      HOWARD
            Have you ever--

                      LUCY
            My entire relationship with
            communism is twenty years ago I
            checked a box.

                      HOWARD
            Why is this coming out now?

                      DESI
            The committee investigated her and
            cleared her. But then last week
            William Wheeler convened a special
            session out here--a private session-
            -called her in again and that's why
            we're sitting here.

                      HOWARD
                (pause)
            And nobody's picked it up.

                      DESI
            Nobody's picked up the story, not a
            single paper. Not a single news
            network, including your own.

                      HOWARD
            Maybe. Maybe we're outa this. We
            just don't know yet.

                      LUCY
            When will we?

                      HOWARD
            If you tape a show Friday night it
            means you still have a show.

            Okay.

                      HOWARD
                (pause)
            Okay.

  HOWARD exits...

                      DESI
            You and me, we've been through
            worse than this.

                            LUCY
                (beat)
            We have?

                            DESI
            No.

                      LUCY
            That's what I thought.

                            LUCY (CONT'D)
            Hey.
                (beat)
            The whole piece was invented out of
            thin air?

                            DESI
                   (beat)
            Huh?

                      LUCY
            Four pages, fifteen-hundred words--

                      DESI
            Are you being funny right now?

                      LUCY
            That's the second time someone's
            asked me that this morning. I'm
            Lucille Ball, when I'm being funny
            you'll know it. They invented the
            whole thing?

                      DESI
            You don't think we got bigger fish
            to fry?
                                                     19.

                     (over)
                 Yes, they invented the whole thing!
                 I was on the boat playing cards.
                 They invented the whole thing and
                 I'm angry at them and I'll do
                 something about it but right now--

                           LUCY
                 Yeah. Got it. Priorities. You're
                 right.

                           DESI
                 Say that again. "Desi, you're
                 right."

                           LUCY
                 No.

       DESI takes LUCY in his arms--

                           DESI
                 Everything's gonna be fine.
                 Nothing's gonna happen to you. I
                 won't allow it. I just won't.

       LUCY kisses DESI...then she takes the handkerchief from
       Desi's jacket pocket and wipes the lipstick off his lips...

                           DESI (CONT'D)
                 You've never done that before.

                           LUCY
                 I know. I've seen other people do
                 it in movies I've been in.


24     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY                                     24

       The group is still waiting at the shoehorn of tables.

                            VIVIAN
                 For the love of God, old man, this
                 isn't hard! Rusty Hamer plays Rusty
                 Williams on the Danny Thomas show.
                 He's in second grade and he had to
                 sign a loyalty oath when he signed
                 his contract which I think is ugly.
                 That's it. I don't know why this is
                 tripping you up. It wasn't
                 confusing.

                (pause)
            There's no such thing as the Danny
            Thomas show, it's called "Make Room
            for Daddy", don't tell me comedy,
            and if Rusty is a communist then
            I'm going to beat the shit out of a
            7-year old, I have no problem with
            that.

                        VIVIAN
            I'm done.

                      MADELYN
                (to BOB)
            That? Right there? Was funnier than
            anything you've written so far this
            year.

                      BOB
            That's not--I've written plenty of--

                        MADELYN
            No.

  A heavy door opens and LUCY and DESI walk in--

                       DESI
                (calling out)
            Good morning!

  LUCY sees someone at the table--DONALD GLASS, this week's
  director--and stops DESI to whisper--

                      LUCY
                (quietly)
            Don Glass is directing this week?

  DESI knows it's the wrong week for a director Lucy doesn't
  like...

                       DESI
                (beat)
            We'll be fine.
                (to the GROUP)
            You're wondering what's goin' on.

                      JESS
            No matter what's going on, we all
            support you a thousand percent.

                      FRAWLEY
            I'd like to find out what's going
            on before I make that commitment.

            Here it is. A long time ago Lucy
            accidentally checked the wrong box
            on her voter registration. That's
            the first act of a new episode
            right there.

                      BOB
            "Lucy Gets Blacklisted".

                      DESI
            That's not a joke, Bob.

                      BOB
                (chastised)
            You made the joke, I just put the
            button--

                      DESI
                (over BOB)
            Last week she testified in a closed
            session. She was cleared. Yeah? She
            was cleared. I don't know where
            Winchell got his information but it
            was wrong. And as you can see, it
            was not picked up by any newspaper.
            So let's do our show. Yeah? Let's
            just do our show. Jess, it's your
            stage.

                      JESS

            Carroll, Madelyn Pugh and myself.

                      FRAWLEY
            It took three of you to write this
            one?

                      JESS
            And directing this week, Donald
            Glass is back with us so let's give
            him a hand.

  Everyone CLAPS...

            Yes.

                      LUCY
            Good morning, I'm Lucille Ball.

                      DONALD
            I sure know that, Lucy.

                      LUCY
            I wanted to make sure `cause you
            haven't been here in a while. Is it
            because you've been going through
            puberty?

                      DONALD
            I look young, yes, but I went
            through it a long time ago and I
            haven't been here because I've been
            directing at Danny Thomas.

                      FRAWLEY
            With the communist kid? Fuck off.

                      LUCY
            You don't have to fuck off, but you
            do have to know that Danny does
            jokes and few people do it better.
            I do physical comedy.

                      DONALD
            I've seen every episode of the
            show.

                      LUCY
            So have 60-million other people--
                (to JESS)
            --are none of them professional
            television directors?!

                      DESI
            She's kidding.

                      DONALD
            I can tell.

            and I have no idea what the fuck
            you were talkin' about, Bill--

            Ah, Des, I'm beggin' you, don't
            ask.

                      DESI
            No problem. I just wanted to say
            that this show is made by Desilu
            Productions, whose president is
            speaking to you right now. And for
            the next 30 minutes I don't want to
            hear a word that isn't in this
            script.

            It's your stage.

            Thank you. "Lucy's putting the
            finishing touches on a fancy dinner

            The table's set for four but there
            are only three chairs, I should've
            put that in the stage direction.

                      BOB
            It's two chairs and a piano bench.

            For a total of?

                      BOB
            Three chairs.

  We're going to start to go in and out of LUCY's head as the
  reading goes on. She's imagining what each beat will be like
  in its final form the way a chess master can see the board
  twelve moves ahead. She can also see and hear what the
  audience is going to laugh at.

                 Sorry?

                           LUCY
                 Why doesn't Lucy hear him?

                           JESS
                 Well he's about to do the thing
                 where you cover someone's eyes and
                 say "Guess who?"

                           LUCY
                 I understand that it's a set-up, I
                 understand why we need Lucy to not
                 hear him, I just don't understand
                 why--in an apartment this size--
                 Lucy doesn't hear--or for that
                 matter, see--the front door open
                 when she's standing 12-feet from
                 it.

                           JESS
                 We'll work on that.

                            LUCY
                 Thanks.

                 "Ricky puts his coat down quietly,
                 tip-toes in back of her and reaches
                 around and covers her eyes with his
                 hands."

                 Hang on. Are we supposed to believe
                 that Ricky believes that Lucy
                 really doesn't know it's him? That
                 Ricky believes that Lucy is not
                 only unfamiliar with his voice--
                 which let's not forget has a Cuban
                 accent--but that he really believes
                 there are at least seven other men
                 who routinely walk into their
                 apartment?

                           DESI
                 She has a pretty good point. She
                 has four or five pretty good
                 points.

                           JESS
                 We'll write a better joke or Ricky
                 will know that Lucy is joking.

                            BOB
                 We can change the names. Pedro,
                 Pablo, Jose.
                     (beat)
                 Because they're Spanish names. I
                 mean Latin names. They're Cuban
                 names.

                 Fred and Ethel Mertz.

                 Wait a minute. What about that big
                 fight Fred and Ethel had? I thought
                 they were mad at each other.

                             LUCY
                 They are.

                  Looking back it may have been an

                 A couple of days before shooting
                 started, Desi was on a soundstage
                 working with a piano and a drum and
                 Ann Miller. Here's what you have to
                 understand--A more handsome and
                 charming man than Desi you've never
                 met. So all the chorus girls were
                 standing around gawking.

                 unrecognizable because she was
                 still in the middle of shooting
                 Dance, Girl, Dance where she was
                 playing a burlesque girl who'd just
                 been beaten up by her pimp.

       DESI is standing by the piano singing "She Could Shake the
       Maracas" as ANN MILLER improvises some steps and then builds
       on it. CHORUS GIRLS are standing around watching and in the
       back is LUCY--her face beaten and her hair all over the
       place. Unrecognizable.

       The music stops and there's a smattering of applause from the
       group. A few CHORUS GIRLS step up to say hello to Desi.

            Also in the chorus?

                      PATTY
            Dancing chorus.

  LUCY steps in...

                      DESI
            And who's this?

                      LUCY
            "Do you remember the first time we
            met? You were rudely attentive but
            now you're obnoxiously
            indifferent."

                      DESI
                (pause)
            What?

                      LUCY
            It's a line from our movie, dumb-
            dumb.

                      DESI
            Do we know each other?
                                                      32.

                 No.

       Another chorus girl steps in--

                           DAISY
                 Desi--I'm Daisy. People are gonna
                 get confused.

                           DESI
                 I don't see no one confusing you
                 with anyone, Daisy.

       The schmoozing continues as LUCY disappears...


44     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - LATER                                      44

       The stage is empty except for DESI and the PIANIST. DESI's
       playing a lullaby on his guitar and singing in Spanish.

       LUCY's standing in the giant doorway, framed by the setting
       sunlight. She looks beautiful now.

       She enjoys the song for a moment before DESI looks up and
       immediately stops--stunned by this woman.

                           LUCY
                 "Do you remember the first time we
                 met?"

                           DESI
                 If we'd met, I'd remember.

                           LUCY
                 "You were rudely attentive but now
                 you're obnoxiously--

                           DESI
                 Wait! That was you?!

                           LUCY
                 --indifferent", that was me, yeah.

                           DESI
                 This studio has talented make-up
                 artists.

                           LUCY
                 "I'm Angie, I'm in the chorus, and
                 I just wanted to say that when I
                 drink I take my clothes off." I'm
                 so curious I have to ask--how did
                 you know that Patty was short for
                 Patricia?

                           DESI
                 I'm Desidorio Alberto--

                           LUCY
                 I don't have that kinda time.

                           DESI
                 And you're Lucille Ball.

                           LUCY
                 Use a line on me you've never road-
                 tested on anyone else. I dare you.

                           DESI
                 Would you like to learn how to
                 rumba?

                           LUCY
                     (pause)
                 Alright nice, and yes I would, but
                 there's absolutely no chance you
                 haven't used that before.


45     INT. CIRO'S - NIGHT                                       45

       A small Latin band is blaring away, the dance floor is packed
       and DESI's showing LUCY how to rumba, which she's pretty good
       at.

                           DESI
                     (talking over the noise)
                 I want you to know I'm not trying
                 to be forward. I'm showing you this
                 because it'll come in handy for
                 your rumba number in the movie.

                           LUCY
                 I don't have a rumba number in the
                 movie.

                             DESI
                 No rumba?

                             LUCY
                 No.

                           DESI
                 That's a sign of a poorly written
                 screenplay.

                           LUCY
                 Well we should dance to something
                 else.


46     INT. CIRO'S - LATER                                         46

       The band is playing a slow number and LUCY and DESI are
       dancing close.

                           DESI
                 Why did you come to Hollywood?

                           LUCY
                 I got kicked out of New York.

                              DESI
                 Seriously.

                           LUCY
                 I mean it. I got kicked out of my
                 acting school for not being good
                 enough.

                           DESI
                 Get outa here.

                           LUCY
                 I won't. I got some modeling work,
                 I was hired and fired as a Ziegfeld
                 Girl but hired as a Goldwyn Girl
                 and that's what took me out here.
                 Why did you come to Hollywood?

                           DESI
                 The Bolsheviks burned my house
                 down.

                     (pause)
                 So...a different reason.

                              DESI
                 Yeah.

       The place is almost empty. LUCY and DESI are sitting at a
       table.

                           LUCY
                 I'm older than you are.

                           DESI
                 How do you know?

                           LUCY
                 I asked. Please don't do the same.
                 But I'm a full-grown woman. I'm not
                 married. I don't have children. On
                 my best days I get cast as the
                 second female lead in forgettable
                 pictures. I don't mean to insult
                 you, I know this one's your
                 Hollywood debut, but Too Many Girls
                 is not...going to be part of the
                 Oscar conversation.

                           DESI
                 You never know.

                           LUCY
                 No, plenty of times you do.
                 Anyway...I'm several years older
                 than you are.


48     INT. DESI'S HOTEL SUITE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                  48

       The doors to the terrace are open and we can see the lights
       of Hollywood in the distance.

       DESI's sitting in a chair in the room with a guitar on his
       lap. He's trying unsuccessfully to write a song.

                           DESI
                     (singing and playing)
                 "Lucille...

                 ...there's not much that rhymes
                 with Lucille...

                 Bastille...but who'd write a song
                 about that?"

       LUCY comes out of the bathroom wearing Desi's white dinner
       jacket over her bra and underwear. She walks by DESI without
       looking at him--

                           LUCY
                 I borrowed part of your tuxedo.

       --and steps out on the terrace.

       DESI stares as she walks by, then stands up, sending the

                 It comes with pants, but I'm
                 wearing them.

                           LUCY
                 Not for long, pal.

                             DESI
                 So...

                             LUCY
                 Yes.

                           DESI
                 Can I call you Lucy?

                            LUCY
                     (beat)
                 No, I think we should keep this
                 professional, don't you?
                     (beat)
                 I was kidding.

                             DESI
                 So was I.

                           LUCY
                 Oh. That was a nice, dry delivery.

                           DESI
                 What's your ambition?

                           LUCY
                 My ambition? For tonight? I wasn't
                 making that clear?

                           DESI
                 I don't mean ambition. What do I

                 Goals?

                           DESI
                 No. Future. Dreams.

            What are my future dreams?

            I should've stuck with ambition.

                      LUCY
            Are you interviewing me?

                      DESI
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            Okay. I live in a small house.

                      DESI
            And your ambition is to live in a
            bigger house.

            My ambition is to live in a home.

            Like for old folks?

            Not a home, not an institution, a
            home. With a family and dinner
            time.

                      DESI
            Can I ask an impertinent question?

                      LUCY
            Are you going to ask me why I'm not
            married?

            No, I was going to ask you why
            you're not a movie star. Why are
            you playing the second female lead
            in Too Many Girls?

                      LUCY
            I'm a contract player at RKO. I
            play the roles I'm told to play. My
            career's gone as far as it's gonna
            go, it's hit its cruising altitude.
            I'm at peace with that. So I'd like
            to be at peace. I want a home.

                      DESI
            You have a lot more talent than the
            roles you play have allowed you to
            exhibit.

                      LUCY
            Now how would you know I have
            talent?

                      DESI
            Because I have talent. You could be
            a serious actress, you should be a
            star by now. But--

                         LUCY
                (beat)
            But what?

                      DESI
            There's also something about your
            physicality. You're--

                      LUCY
            --half naked?

                      DESI
            Sure, but...

                         LUCY
            But?

                      DESI
            There isn't an English word.
                (in Spanish)
            Dotada cineticamente.

                      LUCY
            What does that mean?

       DESI's in bed asleep. LUCY's standing on the terrace
       thinking. She comes back inside and taps DESI on the shoulder
       to wake him up.

                 Hi. Sorry. I need to use the phone
                 to call my fiance.

                            DESI
                 Sure.

                 Wait, what?

                           LUCY
                 It'll just take a second.

       LUCY dials the operator--

                 Your fiance?

                 It's me. Hey, you don't love me, I
                 don't love you, you cheat on me
                 every chance you get and I pretend
                 I'm stupid. So I'm moving out. I'll
                 send someone to pick up my clothes.
                 Okay? Love you. But, you know, not
                 really.

       She hangs up the phone.

                           LUCY (CONT'D)
                 I interrupted you, what were you
                 saying?

       The table read is ending--

                           JESS
                 And we fade to black. End of show.

       There's light applause around the table--

                 Thank you. Notes upstairs.

                 Yeah? I thought you'd be the first
                 one to refuse to work with her.

       DESI gets up to leave--

                           FRAWLEY
                 You mean that?

                           DESI
                 You're not fond of Communists.

                           FRAWLEY
                 I'm less fond of the Committee.

53     INT. LUCY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY                              53

       LUCY's sitting in silence on the couch, looking at a
       newspaper. There's a KNOCK at the door--

                           DESI (O.S.)
                 Lucy?

                           LUCY
                 Yeah.

       DESI steps in.

                           DESI
                 Madelyn was way outa line and I'll
                 talk to Jess.

                           LUCY
                 No, I don't care about that.

                           DESI
                 I care about it.

                           LUCY
                 You told them I checked the wrong
                 box?

                           DESI

                           LUCY
                 Before the table read. You told
                 them I checked the wrong box.

            participate in democracy.

                           LUCY
                 Well, no, pretty obviously it's
                 everybody's goddam business.

                           DESI
                 You don't have to keep checking the
                 papers. I've got people who'll let
                 me know the moment an editor thinks
                 about it. There's something wrong
                 with the story, they know it, and
                 that's why no one's reporting on
                 Winchell.

                           LUCY
                 No. The Confidential story. That's
                 getting picked up.

       LUCY puts the newspaper in DESI's hands as she walks out of
       the room. DESI looks at the gossip column headline--

                     "Does Desi Really Love Lucy?"

54     INT. WARDROBE ROOM - DAY                                  54

       VIVIAN's being fitted for a dress. It's more flattering than
       what we're used to seeing Ethel in.

                           VIVIAN
                 I like this a lot, Tommy.

                           TOMMY
                 It's a great color for you.

                           VIVIAN
                 I really like this.

                           TOMMY
                 And I can cinch the back a little.
                 I can lower the neckline.

            Not on CBS you can't, but still,
            now we're talkin'. Now we're
            cookin' with gas.

                      TOMMY
            Should I bring out some shoes?

                      VIVIAN
            Yes please.

  TOMMY disappears. VIVIAN checks herself out in the full-
  length mirror. LUCY appears in the reflection. She whistles
  her approval.

                      VIVIAN (CONT'D)
            Yeah?

                      LUCY
            That's a nice dress.

                      VIVIAN
            I thought so too.

                      LUCY
            Are you borrowing it from wardrobe
            for a cocktail party?

                       VIVIAN
                (beat)
            A dinner party.

                      LUCY
            Where?

                      VIVIAN
            The apartment of Ricky and Lucy
            Ricardo.

                      LUCY
            This is for the show?

                      VIVIAN
            Lucy's invited--

                      LUCY
            Viv--

                      VIVIAN
            I know, but listen. I'm thinking
            Lucy's invited her to dinner, she
            thinks she's being fixed up with an
            eligible guy.

            She'd want to look nice, it's
            something new for the character.

                      LUCY
            But the character's still Ethel
            Mertz, right?

                      VIVIAN
                (pause)
            Yeah.

  TOMMY's come back in with the shoes but heads right to where
  a newspaper's sitting on a table. LUCY's hand casually gets
  there first.

                      VIVIAN (CONT'D)
            Hey. Don't.

  LUCY looks at the paper and shows it to VIVIAN--

                      LUCY
            "Does Desi Love Lucy Loosely?"
            They took time on that.

                      VIVIAN
            Isn't there enough going on with--
            I'd be more concerned about--

                      LUCY
                (reading)
            "If neighbors hear screams of rage
            followed by the sound of breaking
            crockery coming from the Arnaz
            house this month, they'll know what
            is happening without having to
            investigate. The red-haired Missus
            has just finished reading
            Confidential's report on--"

                      VIVIAN
            In your life have you ever taken
            this stuff seriously?

                      LUCY
            I take my marriage seriously.

                      VIVIAN
            And Desi said?

                      LUCY
                (in DESI's voice)
            "Lucy, I ain't been with no girls
            since the moment I saw you."

            Then believe him.

                       LUCY
            I do believe him. It's an old
            picture, we were there together and
            he was playing cards on the boat
            Wednesday. You'd be more concerned
            with what?

                      VIVIAN
            What?

                      LUCY
            You said, "I'd be more concerned
            with--" and I cut you off. The
            Winchell broadcast.

                      VIVIAN
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            I don't get to choose just one, I'm
            concerned with both.

                      VIVIAN
            Understood. What about the third?
            What'd they say?

                      LUCY
            We didn't think yesterday was the
            best day to tell `em about the
            third.

                      VIVIAN
            Right.

                      LUCY
            We're doing it now. Jess first,
            then the network and Philip Morris.

                      VIVIAN
            Could be worse.

                      LUCY
            How?

                      VIVIAN
            You could be playing Ethel.

       JESS, MADELYN and BOB are working at a large table with a
       writer's assistant, MARY PAT, taking notes. On the wall are
       ideas for future episodes.

                           MADELYN
                 Is Lucy on the phone too long at
                 the top? We only hear one side of
                 the call, are we staying too long
                 at the fair?

                           BOB
                     (to MARY PAT)
                 You don't need to write down
                 everything we say in here.

       MARY PAT writes that down.

                 We'll know when it's on its feet.

       DESI knocks on the open door and he and LUCY walk in--

                 Good morning.

                 Of course, Mr. Arnaz.

                      DESI
            No, we're still okay. No one's
            picked up the story.

                      JESS
            Alright. Looking at Lucy's face I
            thought for sure--

                      LUCY
            I'm pregnant.

                       JESS
                 (pause)
            That's not at all what I was gonna
            say.

                      DESI
            That's what we came to talk about.
            We were gonna have this
            conversation yesterday but other
            things--

                      JESS
            Sure.

                      BOB
            Well this is a one-two punch.

                      LUCY
            It's not a punch, I'm having a
            baby.

                      MADELYN
            What do we do now?

  There's a long silence before LUCY turns to DESI...

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            I know it seems like no one said
            congratulations, but that can not
            be, as these are three of our
            closest friends and colleagues.

                      JESS
            Of course. Mazel Tov.

                       LUCY
            Yeah. With Lucie I was the size of
            a phone booth. You've got about
            seven weeks before you have to
            start hiding me behind boxes and
            chairs and another seven weeks
            after that before I won't fit in
            the frame.

                      JESS
            What do you want to do?

                      LUCY
            Do? Whatever there was to do we've
            done it.

            script you're working on now,
            Episode 9, scratch it. Episode 9 is

            They don't vacation in Europe, they
            go to the Grand Canyon, they go to

            And what does Lucy do?

            She stomps grapes. Lucy and Ethel
            go to an Italian Vineyard--

            grapes.

  that might work and be funny...

                 No.

                           LUCY
                 Yes, I'd like some information
                 please. Are there any grape
                 vineyards around here? I want to
                 see how they make the wine. How
                 they pick the grapes--you know--
                 press the juice out with their
                 feet.

                           BELLMAN
                 There is one little town called
                 Turo where they still make the wine
                 that way.

       performing the famous grape-stomping scene and it's
       accompanied by AUDIENCE LAUGHTER--

       First a WOMAN climbs into the vat and starts stomping on
       grapes.

       LUCY looks over the edge and gives us her squeamish face. The
       WOMAN indicates with a wave of her arm that LUCY should come
       in. LUCY cautiously climbs in and gingerly puts her foot on
       the grapes. Her face reflects that this is a very weird
       sensation. The Italian WOMAN is stomping vigorously and LUCY
       looks like she's walking on eggs.

       crew and the STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING...

       LUCY reaches up to check her earring, which is loose, and she
       tightens it. Then she checks the other ear and feels that her

       down in the grapes.

            He's correct. Once I write it it
            could be good.

            Ricky Ricardo loves America. He
            loves being an American. He's
            grateful to this country and he'd
            never cheat on his taxes.

                      BOB
            It's very relatable. Everyone does.

                      DESI
            I don't. Neither does Ricky.
            Especially when his wife is accused
            of being un-American. Look for
            something else and start working on
            the first pregnancy show.

                      JESS
            Listen to me!
                (pause)
            They're not going to let us do it.

                      DESI
            Let that be my problem.

                      JESS
            I wish I could, Des, but it's very
            much my problem. So instead of
            talking about goddamn grapes--Look,
            what you got to understand is--

                      LUCY
            Jess? They're free to take us off
            the air for the rest of the year
            while continuing to pay our
            contracts and answering questions
            about why motherhood is too
            salacious to put on CBS, but
            something tells me they're not
            gonna go that route. Instead, I
            think Broadcast Standards and
            Practices will give you a list of
            insane restrictions, which might
            even include you winning your bet
            with Desi, and which I have no
            doubt the three of you will
            navigate beautifully.
                (to DESI)
            You told me to be nice. Good?

            I don't care what your first
            thoughts out of the gate were, but
            your first words out of the gate
            were no good.
                (to MADELYN)
            And what was with you at the table
            read?

                      MADELYN
            I'm sorry, she was jumping on every
            stage direction.

                      DESI
            It's her process.

                      MADELYN
            But that process usually happens in
            private. And following your advice,
            maybe every once in a while, the
            first words out of her mouth could
            be "good script."

                      DESI
            Is this the right week for this
            shit?

                      JESS
            Hey--

                      MADELYN
            We do seem to be having some
            success, no?

                      JESS
                (to DESI)
            Look, we're all tired from working
            on this week's script.

                      DESI
            Are you sleepy?   You need a nap?

                      JESS
            Can I talk to you a second, boss?

                      DESI
            Sure.

  They step into--

       We're in the Ricardo's living room set where the cast and
       DONALD the director are in the middle of rehearsal. The
       actors hold their scripts.

                           DONALD
                 Back to right before Vivian's
                 entrance. "When do we eat?" Settle,
                 and action.

                           FRAWLEY
                 When do we eat? I've been living on
                 peanut butter sandwiches.

                           DONALD
                 Bill, that line's gotta take you
                 over to the table.

            You need to cross to the table on
            that.

                      FRAWLEY
            Why?

                      LUCY
            So you can see the table, notice
            that a fourth place is set and say
            your next line.

                      FRAWLEY
            Somebody else coming?

                      LUCY
            Well Fred, I took the liberty of
            asking a young lady to be your
            dinner companion.

                      FRAWLEY
            A young lady?

                      LUCY
            A cute young chick.

                      FRAWLEY
            Oh boy, bring her on.

                      LUCY
            Hang on, let's go back. After I say
            "I took the liberty of asking a
            young lady to be your dinner
            companion", Ricky should take a sip
            from a glass of water on the table
            to keep from laughing. Then when I
            say, "A cute young chick", Ricky
            can choke on his water a little.

                      DESI
            I like that.

                      VIVIAN
            I like it too. The very idea that
            Ethel's a cute young chick should
            make Desi choke.

                       ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                (to the DIRECTOR)
            That's 15.

71     INT. LUCY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                71

       LUCY and DESI walk in and DESI closes the door behind him and
       LUCY starts in right away with an opening paragraph she's
       committed to memory--

                           LUCY
                 "Exactly what makes a husband leave
                 home is something that has been
                 baffling wives since Adam and Eve--
                 "

                            DESI
                 Enough.

                           LUCY
                 "For an outstanding example, let's
                 take one of the nation's most
                 famous husbands--"

                           DESI
                 You've memorized it?

                           LUCY
                 I've memorized worse writing than
                 this.

                           DESI
                 Yes, it's a tabloid.

                           LUCY
                 "With a curvy, red-haired tidbit
                 like Lucy waiting for him at home,
                 would Desi--"

                            DESI
                 Stop it.

            My gang. The night they're talkin'
            about I was with Red Skelton and
            Xavier Cugat. Which one of `em you
            think squealed?

                      LUCY
            They made it up from nothing.

                      DESI
            I heard on Winchell the other night
            that you were a Communist.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            That was true, you idiot!

                      DESI

                 I believe you, I was just messin'
                 around.

                           DESI
                 Good.

                           LUCY
                 No, that gets you outa the woods
                 but it puts you into other woods.

                           DESI
                 What are the other woods.

                           LUCY
                 You don't come home anymore, did
                 you know that?

                 Keep up, it's not hard. I asked did
                 you know you don't come home
                 anymore?

                           DESI
                 Of course I come home. Sometimes I
                 go to the boat and play cards. We
                 drink, it goes late, it's easier to
                 sleep on the boat.

                            LUCY
                 That used to be once a week. Then
                 twice and now it's four or five
                 times. I go home after work and you
                 go to the boat.

                   They never saw each other. Desi and
                   his orchestra were booked at Ciro's
                   and Lucy was under contract at RKO,
                   playing the same role in every
                   movie--none of which left much of a
                   footprint on American cinema. Desi
                   would be done with work around 4AM
                   and Lucy needed to be in hair and
                   make-up at 5AM so they'd meet at
                   the top of Mulholland.

76     INT. CIRO'S - NIGHT                                              76

       DESI's singing "Babalu", backed up by his orchestra. The
       women are particularly enjoying it. He finishes with a
       flourish and to healthy applause.


77     EXT. CIRO'S/BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                77

       A group   of ATTRACTIVE WOMEN are waiting at the back door,
       sitting   on the hoods of their cars and passing around a few
       bottles   of champagne with a few of the musicians. DESI comes
       out and   they start cheering--

                             DESI
                   What do we have here?
                                                      62.

                           MUSICIAN
                 A lot of choices.

                           DESI
                 There's only one choice for me and
                 she's got a powerful right hook.

       DESI's handed a bottle of champagne--

                           WOMAN
                 My friend and I saw the midnight
                 show and the 2AM.


78     EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAWN                              78

       LUCY's leaning against her car, waiting with the engine
       running and the headlights on. After a moment a pair of
       headlights appear from the opposite direction. DESI pulls up
       and gets out in his white dinner jacket and untied bow-tie.

                           DESI
                 Good morning.

                           LUCY
                 I did the calculation. In the
                 course of one week, I see you
                 1/20th as much as your second
                 trombone player.

                           DESI
                 Learn to play the trombone and I'll
                 give you his job.

                           LUCY
                 Well...how hard is the trombone?

                            DESI
                 Maybe it'd be better if we didn't
                 spend the little time we have
                 arguing about why we don't have
                 more time.

                           LUCY
                 Don't make me feel like a bitch
                 because I want to see my husband.

                           DESI
                 I could stay home and be kept by my
                 wife. That'd really complete the
                 picture Americans have of Cuban
                 men.
                                                      63.

                           LUCY
                 What home are you talking about?

                           DESI
                 Or you could quit the film business
                 and just be my wife, but you ain't
                 gonna do that, right?

                             LUCY
                 No.

                           DESI
                 How `bout you come to the club more
                 to watch the show?

                           LUCY
                 I had a new picture open five days
                 ago--you really want me to come
                 down to the club?

                             DESI
                 Why not?

                           LUCY
                     (pause)
                 Okay.


79     INT. CIRO'S - NIGHT                                       79

       DESI's back on stage performing "Cuban Pete" this time.
       LUCY's sitting at a ringside table and DESI can see that
       PHOTOGRAPHERS keep coming and kneeling in front of her to get
       her picture.


80     EXT. CIRO'S/BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT                         80

       The fans are waiting. After a moment, DESI comes out the door
       with LUCY and all the fans immediately react to LUCY. They
       want her autograph and LUCY hands her purse to DESI. DESI
       clocks this turn of events as we go to

81     INT. VIVIAN'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY                           81

       VIVIAN, a dancer by training, is stretching on the floor.
       There's a knock on the door--

                           VIVIAN
                 Come on in.

       MADELYN enters with a plate of food on a tray.

                           MADELYN
                 Good morning.

                              VIVIAN
                 Hey Maddy.

                           MADELYN
                 Some week, huh? Lucille Ball's a
                 threat to the American way of life?
                 She's a threat to writers, camera
                 operators and Desi, but it really
                 stops there. Have you ever had a
                 week like this?

                           VIVIAN
                 No. But we work in Hollywood and
                 something tells me we're all gonna
                 have weeks like this before that
                 committee's done.

                           MADELYN
                     (meaning the stretch)
                 Look what you can still do.

                              VIVIAN
                 Still?

                            MADELYN
                 I regretted it even before I said
                 it. I can't do that and I'm just
                 impressed.

                           VIVIAN
                 What's in your hand?

                           MADELYN
                 I brought you some breakfast from
                 the commissary. They told me you
                 didn't have any.

                           VIVIAN
                 I did. I had a cup of coffee and
                 half a grapefruit.
                                                 65.
Continued: 81

                      MADELYN
            Well I have French toast, bacon,
            eggs and potatoes.

                         VIVIAN
            Enjoy it.

                      MADELYN
            It's for you.

                      VIVIAN
            That was very sweet but no thank
            you.

                      MADELYN
            Is it me or have you lost a little
            weight?

                         VIVIAN
            I have.

                      MADELYN
            Well you look great.

                         VIVIAN
            Thank you.

                      MADELYN
            I'll see you on stage.

                         VIVIAN
            Madelyn?

                         MADELYN
            Yeah.

                       VIVIAN
            Who told you I didn't have any
            breakfast?

                         MADELYN
            I'm sorry?

                       VIVIAN
            You said, "They told me you didn't
            have any."

                      MADELYN
                (beat--shakes her head)
            I don't know. I think-- It was
            Tino. The tall waiter.
                                                      66.

                 Okay.

       MADELYN leaves. VIVIAN sits a moment before--

                           VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                     (pause--to herself)

82     INT. DESI'S OFFICE - DAY                                       82

       JOE, HOWARD, ROGER, TIP--the CBS and Philip Morris executives
       we met earlier, are seated where they were before with DESI
       leaning against the edge of his desk and LUCY sitting in his
       chair.

                           JOE
                 Day 3 and still no pick-up on the
                 Winchell story. Fellas, I think we
                 might be outta this.

                              ROGER
                 Might be.

                           TIP
                 Might be. Howard?

                           HOWARD
                 There's another shoe and none of us
                 are getting outa this alive.

                              JOE
                 Howard--

                           HOWARD
                 They're uncovering something new,
                 they're chasing the original
                 testimony, something, but there's
                 another shoe.

                           LUCY
                 There's nothing to uncover, there
                 are no more shoes.

                           DESI
                 Lucy's pregnant.

                              LUCY
                 Well that.
                              66A.
Continued: 82

  There's a long silence...
                                                 67.
Continued: 82

                      JOE
                (pause)
            What?

                      DESI
            Lucy's pregnant.

                      JOE
                (pause--then to LUCY)
            With a baby?

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            Mm-hm.

                      ROGER
            How, uh...I'm not sure what words
            to use...how much pregnant are you?

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            Why did you think you didn't know
            what words to use?

                      HOWARD
            He means how far...as a percentage
            of nine months--where are we on the
            timeline of--

                      LUCY
            Someone should point a goddam
            camera at this.

                      DESI
            She's twelve weeks pregnant.

                      JOE
                (trying to do the math)
            So that means...

                      LUCY
            Twelve weeks ago I fucked my
            husband.

                      JOE/HOWARD/ROGER/TIP
                (simultaneously)
            No, no, no, etc./That's not what we
            were asking, etc./We don't need to
            talk about the details of, etc.

                      DESI
            She'll start showing in about six
            weeks and a month after that there
            won't be any hiding it.
                                                 68.

                      ROGER
            This isn't a problem.

                        DESI
            It's not.

                      ROGER
            This has happened before, I won't
            say names, but it's been dealt
            with.

                      LUCY
                (to DESI)
            Is he talking about having me
            killed?

                      ROGER
            No. You carry a basket of laundry,
            stand behind chairs, sit with a
            pillow on your lap--

                      DESI
            And those are great ideas--
            especially having Lucy carry a
            basket of laundry in every scene--

                      ROGER
            Or stand behind chairs.

                      DESI
            Where in the Ricardo's living room
            are the giant chairs you're talking
            about?

                      JOE
            Lucy and Ricky redecorate. The
            writers can get some fun out of it.
            And maybe they also get some large
            ficus trees.

                      LUCY
            They would have to be California
            Redwoods and I'd have to stand
            behind them anytime I wasn't doing
            the wash.

                      HOWARD
            Well what do you propose?

                      DESI
            That the Ricardos have a baby.
                                                 69.

                       HOWARD
                (beat)
            What do you mean?

                      LUCY
                (to DESI)
            I told you it was gonna be like
            this.

                      DESI
            Lucy Ricardo will be pregnant on
            the show. An 8-episode arc starting
            with Lucy telling Ricky the happy
            news and ending with the birth of
            the baby.

                      ROGER
            Noooo, no, no, no.

                      HOWARD
            We can't have a pregnant woman on
            television.

                       DESI
            Why not?

                      HOWARD
            Because it's television. We come
            into people's homes.

                      JOE
            Pregnant women often vomit.

                      LUCY
            I know I could any second.

                      ROGER
            May I say something?

                      LUCY
            Frankly, I can't wait.

                      ROGER
            If Lucy Ricardo's pregnant, the
            audience's mind immediately goes to
            how did she get that way. Lucy and
            Ricky sleep in separate beds.

                      DESI
            We'll be pushing the beds together
            too.

                      ROGER
            Oh noooo, no, no.

            I'm sorry, Des, we've gotta put our
            foot down on this one. You can't do
            it. End of discussion.

  DESI pushes the intercom button on his desk--

            Miss Rosen, would you come in
            please with a pad and pen.
                (to the others)
            My secretary.

  MISS ROSEN steps in with a pad and pen--

                      HOWARD
            What are you doing?

                (to MISS ROSEN)
            To Mr. Alfred Lyons, Chairman of
            the Board of Philip Morris.

                       HOWARD
            We don't want to bring Mr. Lyons
            into this.

                      DESI
            "Mr. Lyons, I guess it all comes
            down to you. You are the man who is
            paying the money for this show and
            I will do whatever you decide."

                      HOWARD
            Mr. Lyons doesn't get involved at
            this level.

            "We've given you the number one
            show on television and up until now
            the creative decisions have been in

                 "All I ask from you, if you agree
                 with them, is that you inform them
                 that we will not accept them

                 Yes sir.

       MISS ROSEN exits.

                 And that wasn't even why I married
                 him.

       LUCY gets up and before she walks out the door with DESI, she
       pulls him to her and gives him a passionate kiss for the
       benefit of the executives.

                             LUCY (CONT'D)
                 That was.

       LUCY exits and DESI gives a small "What can I say?" shrug to
       the execs before heading out the door and we

83     INT. "I LOVE LUCY" SET/RICARDO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY             83

       FRAWLEY and VIVIAN ("FRED" and "ETHEL") are locked in a coat.
       Each has one arm in a sleeve and Lucy's tied the coat closed
       with a scarf. We're in the middle of camera rehearsal.

                           ETHEL
                 Lucy, let me out of here!

                           FRAWLEY
                 Untie this coat!

                           LUCY
                 I'm not letting you out until you
                 kiss and make up.

                      ETHEL
            I'll never make up with him after
            the things he said.

                      FRAWLEY
            How about the things you said to
            me? You said my mother looked like
            a weasel.

                      LUCY
            Apologize, Ethel. Tell him you're
            sorry.

                      ETHEL
            Alright. I'm sorry your mother
            looks like a weasel.

                         LUCY
            Now Ethel.

                      ETHEL
            Well I can't help it. He should
            have more consideration. After all,
            I gave him the best years of my
            life.

                      FRAWLEY
            These were the best?

                      DESI
            Alright, now you're even.
                (to "ETHEL")
            What are your conditions for making
            up?

                      LUCY
            We should really go back to the
            dinner table.

                      DONALD
            What was that?

                      LUCY
            We should go back to the dinner
            table.

                      DONALD
            I think given the time we should
            move on. It was good.

                      LUCY
            Yeah, except no it wasn't.

            What.

                      LUCY
            Good. It wasn't good.

                      DESI
            Let's go back.

                      FRAWLEY
            What's happening?

                      VIVIAN
            She wants to go back.

                        FRAWLEY
            To where?

                      VIVIAN
            The dinner scene.

                        FRAWLEY
            What?

                      VIVIAN
                (shouting)
            The dinner scene, ya drunken yontz!

                      FRAWLEY
            Have we hired someone to play Ethel
            yet?

                      DESI
            Alright, let's go.

                      DONALD
            Go forward or go back to the dinner
            scene?

                        LUCY
            Back.

            to do me out of dinner." Cameras re-

  As the cameras re-set and some crew members re-set props over
  to a beautifully laid-out dinner table--

            the first place.

                      LUCY
            Something fundamental was wrong and
            I'll figure out what.

                      DONALD
            I can figure out what, let's all do
            our individual jobs.

  LUCY speaks to DESI quietly and confidentially for a
  moment...

                      LUCY
                (whispering)
            I hit him in the face till he's
            bleeding, does our insurance cover
            that?

                      DESI
                (whispering)
            Yeah, I got the platinum plan.

                      LUCY
                (whispering)
            Good job.

                      DONALD
            Ready, ready.

                      ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
            Quiet please, reahearsal's up.

                      DONALD
            From "You're right, he's not going
            to do me out of dinner." Settle
            and...Action.

                      VIVIAN
            You're right. He's not going to do
            me out of dinner.

                      LUCY
            Good.

  LUCY puts a roast down on the table, then takes a small piano
  bench and puts it on the downstage side of the table. The
  table now has four place settings but three chairs--one on
  each end and one in the middle with its back to the audience.

  LUCY sits at one end and motions "RICKY" to quickly sit at
  the other end.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            Well sit down everyone.

  "FRED" and "ETHEL" both come over and start to take the one
  chair.

            Oh, we don't have anymore chairs.
            You don't mind sharing that one do
            you?

  They both sit down gingerly on the piano bench. They indulge
  in a little jockeying for position. "RICKY" cuts a slice of
  roast beef--

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            The roast beef should be pre-cut.

                      DONALD
            It will be dear.

                      DESI
            How is that, Ethel? Not too much
            fat, is there, Ethel?

  "ETHEL" looks at "FRED'S" behind--

                      ETHEL
            There sure is.

                      LUCY
            He means the meat.

                      ETHEL
            Oh no, the meat is fine.

  "RICKY" gives "FRED" a serving and "FRED" and "ETHEL" start
  to eat while "RICKY" serves LUCY's plate and his own.

  "ETHEL" and "FRED" are having trouble eating in such close
  quarters and that's where the comedy is supposed to come
  from. They jab each other with their elbows and vie for more
  room on the chair until they both fall off.

                         DONALD
            Perfect.

                         LUCY
            Yeah?

            This is camera blocking. We can

            Maybe we don't, it's hard to say

                 Why is this hard to understand? The
                 dinner table isn't working and we
                 need it to. Right there are the
                 building blocks of drama.

       LUCY heads off. We FOLLOW her backstage and into--
                                                   77A.

88     INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                    88

       LUCY walks down the corridor toward her dressing room and
       walks past Vivian's open dressing room door. She stops,
       thinks, turns around and sticks her head in the door.
                                                 78.

            Viv.

  VIVIAN looks up from her dressing table.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            It's not you or Bill. The dinner
            scene. It's Donald Glass.

                      VIVIAN
            Well...it'll be funny.

                      LUCY
            I'm sure of that.

                      VIVIAN
            Can't get better till it gets bad.

                      LUCY
            Cross Step One off the list.

                      VIVIAN
                (laughing a little)
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            Okay.

                      VIVIAN
            You hangin' in there?

                      LUCY
            Look, we've made 37 episodes. You
            do 37 of anything and one of `em's
            gonna be your 37th best. Ours was
            directed by Donald Glass.

                      VIVIAN
            Honey...the committee...they're not
            gonna base their findings on how
            this week's show--

                       LUCY
            Fuck the committee. I said that.
            I'm talkin' about the show. And
            unless you count his wardrobe, Don
            Glass doesn't understand the moving
            parts of physical comedy.
                (beat)
            That's all. My point is, you're not
            the problem.

  LUCY starts to leave--

            Luce?

  LUCY turns back.

                      LUCY
            Yeah.

                      VIVIAN
            Madelyn brought me breakfast this
            morning. French toast, bacon and
            potatoes. She said someone noticed
            I hadn't had breakfast. She said it
            looked like I'd lost some weight.

                      LUCY
            She's right, you look great.

                       VIVIAN
            Madelyn's a staff writer. She
            doesn't bring people their
            breakfast.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            I'm not sure what you're asking. It
            sounds like she was just--

                       VIVIAN
            How would she know I hadn't had
            breakfast?

                       LUCY
                (beat)
            I really don't know.

                      VIVIAN
            It was you, right?

                      LUCY
            Yes. You have to give me credit.
            When I lie, I give up on it pretty
            quick.

                      VIVIAN
            It's admirable.

                      LUCY
            Thanks.

                      VIVIAN
            You told her to bring me breakfast
            and remark on my weight loss.

            Why?

            Because I think you should get off
            this looney diet you're on.

                      VIVIAN
            It's working.

                      LUCY
            It's not good for you.

                      VIVIAN
            I feel great.

                      LUCY
            It's not good for Ethel.

                        VIVIAN
            It's not.

                      LUCY
            We're best friends, Viv, I don't
            want to fight. I just sent over
            some breakfast.

                      VIVIAN
            You didn't just send it over, you
            sent it over with Madelyn and a
            message. And now a new message,
            which is that I look too good.

                      LUCY
            We just want you at the weight you
            were when we cast you.

                      VIVIAN
            Otherwise it'll be bad for Ethel?

                        LUCY
            Yes.

                      VIVIAN
            Or bad for you?

                        LUCY
            Alright--

                      VIVIAN
            No one's gonna stop loving Lucy
            when you're pregnant. GI's don't
            have your picture in their
            barracks.

                      LUCY
            Thanks for that, Viv.

            I'm saying take it easy, that's
            all. Everyone here stands shoulder
            to shoulder with you and no one
            feels funny `cause we're scared to
            death and you're not helping by
            jumping up and down on everyone who
            works here and doing it in front of-

            Goddamit, Viv, most American women
            look like you, not me, and they
            want to see themselves on
            television!

  There's a tense silence before FRAWLEY opens his dressing
  room door--

                      FRAWLEY
            What the hell are the two of you
            screaming about?!

                       LUCY
            Nothing.

                       VIVIAN
            Nothing.

                      FRAWLEY
            I'm in my room taking my mid-
            morning nap.

                      VIVIAN
            Don't you usually do that while
            we're rehearsing?

                      FRAWLEY
            I'd love to see more of that Moss
            Hart wit on the show.

                      VIVIAN
                (to LUCY)
            Don't worry about it. The weight
            always comes back. I can't keep it
            off anymore.

                       LUCY
                (beat)
            This conversation went poorly.

                      VIVIAN
            I thought it was great. I
            definitely feel like performing for
            tens of millions of people now.

                      LUCY
            Alright, so...okay.

  LUCY steps out into--

                  Come with me for a drink.

                  I'm sure it's 10:15 somewhere.

                            LUCY
                  We have to be back on stage.

                            FRAWLEY
                  I wonder if they'll wait for you.

                               LUCY
                  Bill--

        A young P.A., Scott, is walking by--

                            FRAWLEY
                  Kid. Tell the stage Mrs. Arnaz is
                  taking some personal time and
                  she'll be back when she's back.

                               SCOTT
                  Copy that.

                            LUCY
                      (to Scott)
                  Probably 15 minutes.

                               SCOTT
                  Yes ma'am.

                            LUCY
                  And you should remind props that
                  I'll need garden shears for the

            We have to establish right away
            that I'm setting a fancy table.

                      FRAWLEY
            You don't need to explain it to
            him.

                      LUCY
                (still to Scott)
            We'll have flowers in a vase and
            I'll cut one of the flowers--

                      FRAWLEY
            He doesn't care.

                      LUCY
            --it'll be too short. So I'll cut
            the other flowers and then they'll
            be too short and so on.

                         SCOTT
            Got it.

                      LUCY
            So I need garden shears.

                      LUCY
            Regular scissors aren't strong
            enough to cut through the stems.

                      FRAWLEY
            He's thinking a lot about killing
            you now.

       LUCY and FRAWLEY walk through the alley and across the
       street.

                           FRAWLEY
                 It's raining. Is your hair gonna be
                 alright?

                           LUCY
                 I'm fine. Since I started doing
                 this show, rain bounces off my
                 hair.

                           FRAWLEY
                 That's helpful.

                           LUCY
                 I honestly had no idea this place
                 was here.

                           FRAWLEY
                 They like to keep a low profile.

                           LUCY
                 It's hard to imagine why.

                              FRAWLEY
                 After you.

                           LUCY
                 What kind of people go to a bar on
                 a Wednesday morning?

                           FRAWLEY
                 It's an eclectic group.

       They walk into--


90     INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS                                90

       The place is empty except for maybe three people scattered
       around. LUCY and FRAWLEY head to the bar where they're met by
       a BARTENDER.

                           FRAWLEY
                 What are you having?

                 I'll take a tetanus shot.

            You don't drink at work.

                      FRAWLEY
            Desi and I have a deal that I won't
            be drunk at work. Have you ever
            seen me drunk at work?

                      LUCY

            Alright then.

  They drink.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            Are they being polite or do they
            not recognize us?

                      FRAWLEY
            They don't own television sets.

                      LUCY
            Why didn't I think of that?

            Honey, I read seven newspapers
            every day.

                      LUCY
            Seven?

                      FRAWLEY
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            When do you have time to do that?

                      FRAWLEY
            It's 30 minutes between races at
            Santa Anita, it takes me a minute
            and a half to pick a horse.

                      LUCY
            Aren't you at work?
                                                 86.

                      FRAWLEY
            Yeah we have bookies now and
            telephones.

                      LUCY
            Know all about that. Did a Damon
            Runyon picture.

                      FRAWLEY
            In none of those seven newspapers
            have I read anything about Lucille
            Ball being a Communist. I don't
            hear anyone talking about it.

                      LUCY
            Since when do you talk to anyone?

                      FRAWLEY
            I got news for you, the less you
            talk, the more things you hear and
            I haven't heard anything.
            So...problems at home?

                      LUCY
            Problems at home?

                      FRAWLEY
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            No, I'd like very much to have
            problems at home but my problem's
            not home that much. A few times a
            week.

                      FRAWLEY
            He was playing cards on the boat
            Wednesday night.

                      LUCY
            I know. The picture's six months
            old and I was there when it was
            taken. I'm saying why wasn't he
            home? Where I and our daughter
            were?

                      FRAWLEY
            Your husband, Ricky--

                      LUCY
            Desi.

                      FRAWLEY
            Desi--is in love with America like
            no man I've ever known since George
            M. Cohan, who loved America so much
            he wrote the same song five times.
            Okay? Desi loves America as much as
            that guy. But that doesn't mean
            he's not Cuban.

                      LUCY
            I know that.

                      FRAWLEY
            The world he's from has a very
            narrow definition of manhood.

                      LUCY
            I know that too.

                      FRAWLEY
            The man is the man.

                      LUCY
            Mm.

                      FRAWLEY
            And you know what? Not for nothin',
            but the women are happy.

                      LUCY
            You've asked them?

                      FRAWLEY
            They look happy.

                      LUCY
            I see.

                      FRAWLEY
            But that's neither here nor there.

                      LUCY
            It really isn't.

                       FRAWLEY
            He's mesmerized by you, Lucille.
            And he misses you when you're in
            two different places, he does, I'm
            a witness.

                      LUCY
            He doesn't have to, we live in the
            same house.

                       FRAWLEY
            He does have to, that's what I'm
            saying. He has to spend time away
            from you so that he can feel like
            he's not--

                      LUCY
            --second banana. I navigate male
            egos for a living, bud.

                        FRAWLEY
            Then why are you running the set?
                 (beat)
            Why are you running rehearsals?
            You're doing it right in front of
            him.

                      LUCY
            I can't prioritize the director's
            feelings over the health of the
            show.

                      FRAWLEY
            No, not--I couldn't care any less
            about Donald's feelings if I tried
            hard. He's a hack but we'll
            overcome that because, frankly,
            we're not doing Uncle Vanya.

                       LUCY
            Got it.
                (beat)
            But the business at the dinner
            table has to be precise.

                      FRAWLEY
            Really? I was only in vaudeville 40
            years so I wouldn't know about
            these things of which you speak.

                      LUCY
            I know you know! So why do you care
            if--

                       FRAWLEY
                (over)
            You did it in front of Desi...is my
            point.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            Lemme tell you something about
            Desi. He runs this show. Every
            creative decision goes through him.
            Every business decision--the
            network, Philip Morris--and if that
            wasn't enough, he's camera ready on
            Monday. It takes me five days to
            get a laugh and he's killing at the
            table read and that man, believe
            me, is nobody's second banana.

                      FRAWLEY
            How many people know that?
                                                     89.

                           FRAWLEY
                 That Desi runs the show. How many
                 people know that?

                           LUCY
                     (pause)
                 There's me. And I just told you.

                           FRAWLEY
                 You get the picture?


91     EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY                                       91

                           OLDER MADELYN
                 There was a minute there when Lucy
                 was gonna be a serious actress in
                 serious movies. She was gonna
                 compete for roles with Crawford and
                 Hayworth. It might've been Lucy in
                 All About Eve and you know what--
                 she'd have blown the doors off the
                 place. It was almost like that. For
                 a minute there.

93     EXT. LUCY AND DESI'S BACKYARD/POOL - DAY                    93

       DESI's sitting by the pool reading a book, and, after a
       moment, the back door flies open and LUCY runs out with her
       shoes in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other.
       She's disheveled desperately gasping for breath.

                              DESI
                 Lucy?

       LUCY tries to say something but doesn't have the air yet.

                           DESI (CONT'D)
                 What happened?

                            LUCY
                     (barely audible--breathing
                       heavy)
                 Flat tire. `Bout a quarter mile
                 back.

                      DESI
            You abandoned the car there?

                      LUCY
            Sprinted the last five-hundred
            yards.

                      DESI
            What's going on? Also you ran with
            a bottle of champagne in your hand?

                      LUCY
            Bringing it...more festive. I got
            it. I got the part.

                      DESI
            Which part?

                      LUCY
            I got the part, Des. The Big
            Street.

                      DESI
                (pause)
            You said it was going to Rita
            Hayworth.

                      LUCY
            Scheduling problems. Then they went
            to Judy Holliday. Scheduling
            problems. I've got the female lead
            in The Big Street.

                       DESI
            That's tremedous.
                (beat)
            That's tremendous.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            I'm opposite Henry Fonda.

                      DESI
            When does it start photography?

                      LUCY
            Two weeks. Still can't catch my
            breath.
                (pause)
            It's Damon Runyon.

            looking forward to you coming out
            on tour.

                      LUCY
            Rita Hayworth had scheduling
            problems.

                      DESI
            So did you.

  LUCY takes a moment...then tosses her shoes aside--

                      LUCY
            You don't think I want to be in the
            same city at the same time as my
            husband? What do I talk about every-
            -

                      DESI
            I know, I know that.

                      LUCY
            Every decision I make is based on
            being near you. Every single
            decision.

                      DESI
            Well, yeah. But obviously not every
            single decision.

                       LUCY
            You know how many years I've spent
            sticking my head in the frame,
            saying something bitchy and going
            away? Crappy little roles in
            pictures I wouldn't pay a nickel to
            see if the theater had the only
            available air conditioning. If The
            Big Street is a hit I'll be getting
            the roles that go to Rita and Judy
            and Betty.

                      DESI
            Which Judy?

                      LUCY
            Holiday. Who's the baseball player
            you talk about? The one that sat
            down and let Lou Gehrig--

                      DESI
            Wally Pipp.

                      LUCY
            --start that streak? Gehrig was his
            understudy.

                      DESI
            Backup.

Continued: 93

                      LUCY
            And the guy took a rest one day and
            Gehrig came in and didn't come out
            for forty years?

                      DESI
            Fourteen years and it was Wally
            Pipp.

                      LUCY
            Okay, well, imagine if Wally Pipp
            had scheduling problems and Lou
            Gehrig, instead of grabbing his
            glove, toured with his husband's
            Latin orchestra. It would've
            changed the course of baseball.

                      DESI
            And the course of Latin music.

                      LUCY
            Rita Hayworth is Wally Pipp. I'm
            Lou Gehrig. The Big Street is the
            Yankees.

                      DESI
            I understood the metaphor so long
            ago.

                      LUCY
            You don't have to tour. You could
            stay in town.

                      DESI
            And do what?

                      LUCY
            Sell out Ciro's every night.

                       DESI
            We're not a house band. I'd like to
            sell out New York, Chicago and
            Miami too.

                      LUCY
            I know. Eight weeks. I'll come to
            wherever you are on the weekends.
            So it'll be important that you not
            fall in love with someone else
            Mondays thru Fridays.

            Agreed. And it'll be helpful if you
            don't sleep with Henry Fonda or
            Joseph Cotton.

                      LUCY

            You really want to compare rumors?

                      DESI
            No.

                      LUCY
            Yeah.

            Hey, look at me.

                      LUCY
            I already am.

                      DESI
            They're rumors. I have never, and
            will never, have an interest in
            being with anyone but you.

                      LUCY
            Should we open the champagne, take
            our clothes off and go skinny
            dipping in the pool?

            That bottle of champagne is
            basically a grenade now but all
            your other ideas were good.
                (beat)
            Lucy, Jesus. You're gonna be a
            movie star.

                      LUCY
            You comfortable with that?

  DESI takes LUCY by the shoulders...

                      DESI
            Am I comfortable with that?

  And the champagne bottle, which is laying on its side,
  EXPLODES, with the cork shattering a wine glass.

  LUCY and DESI stare at it...

                      LUCY
            That bottle has comic timing.
                                                   93A.

       LUCY sits on a couch in the waiting area. She takes in the
       framed posters of classy hit movies and smiles a little to
       herself. The SECRETARY notices.

                 I've been at the studio for almost
                 ten years and I've never been in
                 the president's office.

                           SECRETARY
                 Mr. Koerner isn't the president,
                 he's the head of production.

                           LUCY
                 Second in command. Still. Higher
                 than I've ever gotten.

       The SECRETARY's phone buzzes and she picks it up--

                           SECRETARY
                 Yes sir.
                     (to LUCY)
                 You can go on in.

       LUCY gets up, straightens herself out and walks into

                           KOERNER
                 Lucille. Charles Koerner.

                           LUCY
                 Lucille Ball.

                           KOERNER
                 Do you like Lucille or Lucy?

                           LUCY
                 Lucy's fine. I mean either's fine.
                 Lucy.

                              KOERNER
                 Alright.

                           LUCY
                 And do I call you Charlie?

                           KOERNER
                 Anyone as brilliant as you were in
                 The Big Street can call me Betsy
                 and I wouldn't care.

                              LUCY
                 Thank you.

                           KOERNER
                 Sit. Please. Right there.

                           LUCY
              Thank you.

  They sit.

                        KOERNER
              That was a whole new side of you
              we've never seen. Where has that
              been?

                        LUCY
              It's been buried under bad movies.

                        KOERNER
              I've heard you make some form of
              that joke before.

                        LUCY
              Keep putting me in pictures like
              Big Street and you won't hear it
              again.

                        KOERNER
              We're dropping your contract, Lucy.

  LUCY laughs...

                        KOERNER (CONT'D)
              No, it's not a joke. RKO's dropping
              your contract.

                        LUCY
                  (pause)
              I don't understand.

                        KOERNER
              We don't have anything for you.

                        LUCY
                  (pause)
              I don't--This is happening fast.
              The Big Street was a hit.

                        KOERNER
              It was a critical hit.

                        LUCY
              I get there wasn't a stampede to
              the box office, but you didn't lose
              money, did you?

                           KOERNER
              No.

                      LUCY
            Do you understand the conditions
            under which this picture was
            finished?

                      KOERNER
            It has nothing to do with--

                      LUCY
            Damon Runyon left town before
            principal photography, our director
            joined the army during post-
            production and our editor died. He
            just flat-out died.

                      KOERNER
            There were a number of obstacles.

                      LUCY
            That's accurate. Did you read the
            reviews?

                      KOERNER
            They were very impressive.

                      LUCY
            They were more than impressive.

                      KOERNER
            Lucy--

                      LUCY
            I blew Henry Fonda off the screen.

                      KOERNER
            This has nothing--

                      LUCY
            Henry Fonda, who is very much under
            contract here at RKO.

                      KOERNER
            As a matter of fact you blew him
            off the screen `cause it was his
            last picture he owed at RKO and
            your director couldn't get him to
            give a damn.

                      LUCY
            Making my job that much harder.

                      KOERNER
            This has nothing to do with your
            performance in The Big Street.

Continued: 95

                      LUCY
            But it should have everything to do
            with my performance in The Big
            Street. I showed what I can do and
            that's just the beginning of what I
            can do. That's just the beginning
            of it. I can do comedy too. Are you
            sure this isn't a joke?

                      KOERNER
            It's a tough business.

                      LUCY
            I know that! I've been in it since
            I was fourteen!

                      KOERNER
            But you're 35 now.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            And that's the problem?

                      KOERNER
            No, the problem is that you're
            really 39, aren't you?

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            Mm-hm. 39-year olds don't go to
            your movies? They don't like seeing
            stories about themselves?

                      KOERNER
            You came through for us when Judy
            Holliday and Rita Hayworth were on
            other pictures and we didn't want
            to lose Fonda. This studio has a
            handshake understanding with Metro
            and Warner and they'll loan us
            Holliday or Hayworth so we just
            don't have enough for you that
            would warrant keeping you under
            contract.

                      LUCY
            Judy Holliday does one thing very
            well but it's just one thing.

                      KOERNER
            I know how you're feeling right
            now, I've had to have this
            conversation a hundred times.

                           LUCY
                 I'm surprised, `cause you're
                 terrible at it.

                           KOERNER
                 Can I make a suggestion?

                           LUCY
                 Be younger?

                           KOERNER
                 Radio.

                           LUCY
                     (pause)
                 The hell did you just say to me?

                           KOERNER
                 You've got the voice for it. I've
                 noticed there's a lot you can do
                 with your voice. You should think
                 about radio.

                           LUCY
                 You should go fuck yourself, Betsy.

       LUCY gets up to leave and we

96     EXT. LUCY AND DESI'S BACKYARD - NIGHT                          96

       LUCY's sitting by the pool, reading a script by a hanging
       lantern and smoking a cigarette. She has a glass of wine and
       there's an almost-empty bottle sitting next to her.

       After a moment, DESI appears at the door...

                           DESI
                 Lucy?

                           LUCY
                 Yep?

                           DESI
                 What are you doing?

                           LUCY
                 I'm reading scripts.

                           DESI
                 It's three o'clock in the morning.

            I know. I'm drunk too.

  DESI walks over to her...

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            I know why you like drinking. I
            didn't get it until about two hours
            ago.

                      DESI
            You read any good movies?

                      LUCY
            These are radio pilots.

                       DESI
            Oh yeah?

                       LUCY
            Yeah.

                      DESI
                (pause)
            You know there's nothing wrong with
            radio. I do it all the time.

                      LUCY
            You're a bandleader.

  DESI takes that in, nods, gets up and heads back to the
  house. He turns and calls back--

                      DESI
            You know Bataan was a hit too.

                      LUCY
            I didn't hear you.

                      DESI
            Bataan was a hit. And I was good.
            The reviews were Valentines. I
            didn't bang a drum. It would've led
            to better parts except I had to go--
            what do you call it--fight World
            War II. Now those crappy little
            parts in pictures you wouldn't pay
            a nickel to see if it was the only
            available air conditioning in the
            --

97     INT. RICRADO'S LIVING ROOM SET - DAY                      97

       We're in the middle of a dress rehearsal. JESS, MADELYN, BOB
       and others are sitting in the bleachers.

       "RICKY" is helping "LUCY" through the front door. "LUCY" is
       wrapped in bandages.

                           DESI
                 Honey--are you sure you're alright?
                 Are the bandages really fake?

                           LUCY
                 Oh I'm fine. Thank goodness the
                 Mertz's had their awnings up.

                           DESI
                 The whole thing was my fault.

                           LUCY
                 No, it was my fault. Weren't we
                 silly?

                           DESI
                 Yeah. We'll never fight again.

       They kiss. "FRED" comes in the door looking very sad.

                           FRAWLEY
                 You okay, Lucy?

                           LUCY
                 Oh, I'm fine.

                           FRAWLEY
                 Are you sure?

                           LUCY
                 Yeah. Don't look so sad. I'm really
                 alright.

                           FRAWLEY
                 I wasn't sad about that. I just saw
                 Ethel and she's so mad about what
                 we did, she's gone home to her
                 mother!

                      LUCY
            Yeah, it's not, but I wanted to
            circle back and express again my
            serious concern about Ricky's
            entrance at the top. I brought it
            up at the table read Monday and
            there haven't been new pages.

                      JESS
            Because it's gonna work.

                      LUCY
            Hear me out.

                      JESS
            Okay.

                      LUCY
            Right now Lucy's trimming the
            flowers on the table when the front
            door opens and Ricky comes in.

                      JESS
            We're gonna have to cut the
            flowers. I don't mean "cut the
            flowers", I mean cut the flowers.

                (pause)
            I couldn't understand the
            difference between those two line
            readings.

                      JESS
            We're running long. We have to cut
            the bit with the flowers.

                         DESI
            How long?

                      JESS
            About a minute.

                      LUCY
            Alright, we'll get back to the
            flowers. The door opens, Ricky
            comes in and Lucy doesn't see or
            hear him, which is unusual because
            the front door is--you know--right
            there, and in previous episodes
            we've established that Lucy's eyes
            and ears are connected to her
            brain.

                      JESS
            We buy the conceit.

                         LUCY
            I'm sorry?

                      JESS
            We buy it. Lucy's so focused on
            making the table nice she doesn't
            even notice Ricky coming in the
            door.

                      LUCY
            Okay, I'll run with that. Ricky
            walks up to her quietly, puts his
            hands over her eyes and says--

  She points to DESI--

                      DESI
            "Guess who it is."

                      LUCY
            And Lucy says, "Bill?, Sam?, Pat?,
            Ralph?"

                      JESS
            She's teasing him.

                      LUCY
            Yes. She's teasing him. That's
            clear. But then Ricky responds--

  She points to DESI--

                         DESI
            "No!"

                      LUCY
            No! And there's a stage direction
            for Ricky that says, "Burning". No!
            He's upset. Lucy continues the
            teasing--George, Julius, Stephen,
            Ivan?

                      BOB
            We changed that to "Pedro? Julio?
            Juan? Guillermo?"

                      MADELYN
                (imitating BOB)
            "Because those are Spanish names. I
            mean Mexican. Cuban. Latin. They're
            Brazilian names! Turkish!"

                         BOB
            You good?

                         MADELYN
            Yeah.

                      ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
            We're moving into a meal penalty.

                      LUCY
            Lucy guesses some names.

                         JESS
            Teasingly.

                      LUCY
            And the script indicates that Ricky
            then takes his hands away from
            Lucy's eyes, turns her around and
            says--

  She points to DESI--

                      DESI
            "No! It's me!"

                      LUCY
            So my question again, Jess, is does
            Ricky honestly, truly believe that
            there might be eight different men
            who routinely walk into their
            apartment--all of whom sound
            exactly like Desi Arnaz?

                      JESS
            You think we're saying Ricky's
            stupid?

                      LUCY
            I think we're saying the audience
            is. And that's something for which
            they won't soon forgive you.

                      JESS
            Do you charge for these lessons?

                      LUCY
            A ton.

                      JESS
            For the sake of the joke, the
            audience will take the leap with
            us.

                      LUCY
            They will, but they'll need a
            busload of orthopedists when they
            land.

                      ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
            Jess--

                      JESS
            Let's talk about it after lunch.

                      LUCY
            I have an idea.

                      JESS
            I've got a crew here. We're about
            to run into a penalty.

                      LUCY
            Lucy's working on the flowers.

                      JESS
            We're cutting the flowers for time.
            I don't mean literally cutting the
            flowers--

                      LUCY
            I can not go through that again.
            Ricky opens the door, comes in,
            shuts the door the way we've seen
            him do in thirty-seven episodes.
            Lucy doesn't acknowledge him.

            So far you're describing the
            script.

                      LUCY
            Right. But instead of playing the
            hands-over-the-eyes guessing game,
            Ricky just stands there.

            He can't understand why Lucy didn't
            notice him come home anymore than
            we can. He stands there for a full
            beat, and then another, and then
            merrily and in a slightly
            exaggerated manner says--as we've
            seen him say a hundred times--

  She points to DESI--

                      DESI
            "Lucy, I'm home!"

  Everyone LAUGHS, and once the laughter dies down...

                      LUCY
            For Ricky is funny.

                      JESS
            Luce? Let's talk about it after
            lunch.

                (calling out)
            That's lunch. One hour. Back on
            stage for notes.

  People begin to head off their separate ways. FRAWLEY catches
  LUCY's eye and shrugs his shoulders as if to say, "What did
  we just talk about yesterday?"

                      LUCY
                (calling out)
            Hang on!

  Everyone stops...

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            Des. Did that work for you?

                      DESI
            Works perfect.

                      LUCY
                (to JESS)
            We'll talk about it after lunch.

  People start leaving again. As LUCY walks past FRAWLEY she
  quietly says--

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            It needed to be fixed.

98     INT. WRITERS' ROOM - DAY                                    98

       JESS, MADELYN, BOB and MARY PAT are sitting around the table.

                           BOB
                 I think we can get more out of
                 "hypocrite".

                              MADELYN
                 Yeah.

                              JESS
                 Like what?

                           BOB
                 Like Lucy says, "Well it's nice to
                 know I'm married to a hypocrite"
                 and Desi gets his back up and says--

                           MADELYN
                 "Hypocrite!" then turns to Fred and
                 says, "What's a hypocrite?"

                           BOB
                 Fred tells him-- "It's a person who
                 says one thing but does another"
                 and Desi says, "Thank you" and
                 turns back to Lucy and says--

                           MADELYN
                 "Oh yeah?!"

                              JESS
                 Good.

                           BOB
                 Yeah, that's exactly what I was
                 going to pitch.

                           MADELYN
                 But I pitched it faster.

                           BOB
                 By interrupting me.

                           MADELYN
                 How do you think I got to be a
                 woman in a comedy room?

       There's a KNOCK on the door and LUCY sticks her head in--

                  Madelyn had a good idea. We shoot
                  it both ways and see which one gets
                  the bigger laugh.

                            BOB
                  That was my idea.

                            LUCY
                  It's a bad idea.

                            MADELYN
                      (to BOB)
                  It's just not your day.

                            LUCY
                      (to JESS)
                  Can I have a minute in your office?

                               JESS
                  Sure.

        JESS gets up and walks out into--

                  What's wrong with shooting it both
                  ways?

                            LUCY
                  Well you'll be on the floor during
                  the show, right?

                            JESS

                               JESS
                  I suppose.

                            LUCY
                  Since we're doing it both ways, how
                  about we do it once with your pants
                  on and once with your pants off?

            It's not the same.

                      LUCY
            It is, and I don't want to do the
            version with my pants off in front
            of two-hundred people. But I need
            to talk to you about something
            else.

  LUCY closes the door.

                      JESS
            You're not gonna tell me you're
            pregnant again, are you?

                       LUCY
            No. I'm still pregnant from before,
            but no. Jess, you know how much I
            value you.

                      JESS
            I think I do.

                      LUCY
            You know you do.

                      JESS
            Okay.

                      LUCY
            And you also know what it is Desi
            does around here.

                      JESS
            Sure.

                      LUCY
            I mean every business decision goes
            through Desi. In fact most business
            decisions are made by Desi.

                      JESS
            You married a very bright man.

                      LUCY
            I did. He also makes a lot of
            creative decisions.

                      JESS
                (pause)
            I'm not sure I'd say a lot.

                       LUCY
            Well...I would. I'd say a lot. He
            devised the camera system we use.
            He's the reason the east coast
            isn't seeing the show on a foggy
            kinescope.

                      JESS
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            And even though we use three
            cameras, the studio audience can
            see every scene, that's him too.
            And the cast, the four of us, we
            can see the audience.

                      JESS
            I give him a lot of credit for
            that.

                      LUCY
            He's the one who thought up Lucy
            being pregnant on the show.

                      JESS
            That's never gonna happen `cause no
            matter what CBS says, Philip Morris
            is never gonna let it happen, but,
            like I said, I give him credit.

                      LUCY
            That's the thing though. You don't.

                      JESS
            What do you mean?

                      LUCY
            He doesn't get credit as an
            executive producer, which, let's
            face it, is what he is. You get
            sole credit.

                      JESS
            I didn't win my credit in a raffle,
            I earn it. I'm the show runner, not
            to mention being the creator of the
            show.

                      LUCY
            I don't see how we could do the
            show without you.

                      JESS
            You absolutely could not.

                            LUCY
                  I don't see how we could do it
                  without Desi either.

                            JESS
                  Because he plays Ricky which he
                  does get a screen credit for.

                            LUCY
                  Jess--

                            JESS
                  Is this something our agents should
                  be talking about?

                            LUCY
                  No.

                            JESS
                  Because I'm not at all comfortable
                  with this conversation.

                            LUCY
                  I'm about to make you less
                  comfortable. I need you to help me
                  save my marriage.
                      (pause)
                  I need you to help me save my
                  marriage.


101     INT. WRITERS' ROOM - DAY                             101

        MADELYN and BOB are waiting along with MARY PAT...

                            BOB
                      (pause)
                  What do you think they're talking
                  about in there?

                            MADELYN
                  I think they're talking about you.
                  I think they want to pay you less
                  because you're not as funny as I
                  am.

        JESS and LUCY step out of JESS's office--

                            JESS
                  Mary Pat, would you ask Desi if I
                  can come see him?

                            MARY PAT
                  Sure.
                                                      111.
      Continued: 101

        LUCY starts to head off and JESS slams his office door behind
        him a lttle too hard. LUCY clocks that and then calls into
        the writers room--

                               LUCY
                  Madelyn?

        LUCY motions for MADELYN to step outside.

                               MADELYN
                  Yeah.

        MADELYN steps into--


102     INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                               102

        --and she and LUCY take a few steps away for privacy. They
        speak quietly.

                            MADELYN
                  Was everything alright in there?

                            LUCY
                  Yeah. So listen, it has to be
                  coherent. If it's anything goes
                  then nothing's funny

                            MADELYN
                  Anything Goes was a hit.

                            LUCY
                  Not Cole Porter's Anything Goes, I
                  mean--

                            MADELYN
                  I know. Why are you telling me?

                            LUCY
                  The opening, Ricky's entrance with
                  his hands over my eyes, that was
                  Jess, right?

        MADELYN takes a moment before--

                            MADELYN
                  Outside of that room we make it a
                  point not to talk about who wrote
                  what.

                            LUCY
                  It wasn't Jess?

                         MADELYN
                (beat)
            Again--

                      LUCY
            You know I'm right about the logic.
            Why aren't you backing me up
            instead of endorsing some plan to
            shoot it both ways.

                      MADELYN
            Listen, why don't we get together
            for a drink or a swim this weekend
            and we can put it on the agenda.

                      LUCY
            The show's tomorrow and I'm fine
            talking about it now.

                      MADELYN
            By all means, let's unnecessarily
            add more to what you're worried
            about this week.

                      LUCY
            I'm not worried--

                         MADELYN
            Shhh.

                      LUCY
                (quieter)
            I'm not worried. I'm saying that I
            count on you to be the firewall--to
            be--to make sure--just--logic,
            okay?

                      MADELYN
            I won't say who wrote what, but I
            can tell you that I'm the lady in
            there trying to make Lucy smarter.

                         LUCY
                (beat)
            `Scuse me?

                      MADELYN
            I'm the one trying, every week, to
            make--

                      LUCY
            Lucy's dumb?

                       MADELYN

            I didn't say that.
                                                113.
Continued: 102

                      LUCY
            But you're trying--struggling, it
            sounds like--to make Lucy smarter.

                      MADELYN
            I created this character with you.

                      LUCY
            And she needs to be smarter.

                      MADELYN
            She sometimes, for the sake of
            comedy, is infantilized.

  LUCY says nothing...

                      MADELYN (CONT'D)
            This is a crazy week, time and
            place to be having this
            conversation. This is important to--

                      LUCY
            How is she infant--

                      MADELYN
            She literally says "Waaah".

                      LUCY
            `Cause when she does, 60-million
            people laugh--just like for Lou
            Costello and Stan Laurel--and you
            get paid.

                      MADELYN
            When those two grown men play slow-
            witted five-year olds, I cringe.

                      LUCY
            Then I question your comedy IQ.

                      MADELYN
            No you don't, you think I'm the
            funniest writer in the room and
            that's why you're talking to me and
            not Jess.

                      LUCY
            Many people regard Lucy as clever.
            She always has a plan to overcome
            an obstacle.

                      MADELYN
            Yeah, but oftentimes that obstacle
            is her husband's permission.

                      LUCY
            You really think this week, right
            now, is the best time to talk about
            this?

                      MADELYN
            No! I specifically said that 30-
            seconds ago.
                (pause)
            Look, it's just a female
            perspective from another
            generation.

                      LUCY
            Another generation? You're on a
            roll.

                      MADELYN
            Bette Davis, Bacall, Hepburn--

                      LUCY
            Funny women.

                      MADELYN
            --Judy Holliday--

                      LUCY
            Judy Holliday? Go to hell.

                      MADELYN
            They are funny women and they're
            smart and tough and they outsmart
            the men. Why do you and Gracie
            Allen feel like you have to--

                      LUCY
            Okay, stop. Stop stop stop. Maddie,
            I love you. You're like, I guess, a
            great-granddaughter to me from
            another generation. And it's my
            fervent wish for you that one day
            you're half as funny as Gracie
            Allen. In the meantime, please
            remember that Lucy and Ricky and
            Fred and Ethel, if they live past
            tomorrow, have to live in a reality
            that accepts the physical laws of
            the universe. Ricky knows that Lucy
            doesn't think there are possibly
            eight other men in the apartment.

                      MADELYN
            Understood.

                      (to LUCY)
                  But I don't make that decision.

                            JESS
                  Mary Pat, cut the flowers. And to
                  be clear, by "cut the flowers"--

                            BOB
                  She knows exactly what you mean.

        MARY PAT nods that she does.

                      (to MADELYN)
                  Let's go.

        LUCY's left standing there...

103     INT. DESI'S OFFICE ROOM - DAY                              103

        DESI's pacing a little with a script in his hands, going
        through his lines. He tosses the script on the couch and
        lights a cigarette. Then paces a little bit.

        There's a knock on the door--

                            DESI
                  Come on in.

        MISS ROSEN opens the door--

                            MISS ROSEN
                  Mr. Oppenheimer is here to see you
                  with Mr. Carroll and Miss Pugh.

                            DESI
                  Nothing from Mr. Lyons yet?

                              MISS ROSEN
                  No.

                             DESI
                   Anyone at Philip Morris?

                                MISS ROSEN
                   No.

                             DESI
                   You think they know something we
                   don't know yet?

                             MISS ROSEN
                   I think if they did, our offices
                   would be empty by now.

                                DESI
                   Okay.

         DESI calls out--

                   Camina conmigo al escenario!

103A     INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                           103A

                             DESI
                   Walk me to the stage. We're an hour
                   behind.

                             JESS
                   Madelyn's got a new joke for the
                   second act.

                             MADELYN
                   I just this minute told Lucy that
                   we don't talk about who wrote what.

                             BOB
                   And Madelyn came up with the joke
                   only seconds after I did.

                              MADELYN
                   Isn't it possible that two comedy
                   writers working on the same script
                   came up with the same joke at the
                   same time?

                             BOB
                   It's possible.

                                MADELYN
                   Thank you.

                             DESI
                   Do I need to be here for any of
                   this?

         JESS hands DESI a piece of paper. DESI looks it over...

                             DESI (CONT'D)
                   "Hypocrite?! What's a hypocrite?"

         They turn onto--


103B     INT. NEW CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                            103B

                             MADELYN
                   That's to Fred.

         DESI reads the rest of the new joke...

                             DESI
                   Got it. Good. Was that what you
                   wanted me for?

                              JESS
                   The hypocrite joke is for Episode
                   9, that's the script we're working
                   on. If Lucy's going to be pregnant--
                   Lucy Ricardo--we have to introduce
                   it in 9 according to your
                   timetable.

                             DESI
                   Yeah.

                             JESS
                   So I just wanted to confirm with
                   you that there's no chance we're
                   doing that.

                             DESI
                   We are doing that.

         They walk through a door and onto--


103C     INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS                                   103C

         --where a piece of the set is being worked on by a couple of
         of stagehands, lights are being re-focused and a camera is
         being built.
                                                118.

                      JESS
            You know Phillip Morris won't let
            us and even if they did--

                        DESI
            What.

                      JESS
            We don't want to see this girl
            pregnant. We don't want to know
            that she's pregnant. We don't want
            to know how she got pregnant.

                      DESI
            Do we have viewers who don't know
            how women get pregnant?

                      JESS
            Yes, they're called children.

                      DESI
            Do any of these children have
            younger brothers or sisters?

                      JESS
            You know what else a lot of our
            viewers are? Christian.

                      DESI
            I'm way ahead of you. I'm gonna
            have a priest, a minister and a
            rabbi review every script.

                      MADELYN
            I'm gonna be re-written by a
            priest, a minister and a rabbi?

                      BOB
            There's a joke in there somewhere.

                      MADELYN
            Good, because after being re-
            written by a priest, a minister and
            a rabbi there aren't gonna be many
            left in the script.

                        DESI
            Good one.

                        JESS
            Des--
                                                119.

                      DESI
            Enough. I sent a telegram Tuesday
            to Alfred Lyons.

                        JESS
            You did.

                      DESI
            I've put the decision is his hands.

                      JESS
            Okay. Okay good. Okay.

                      DESI
            You're that sure he's gonna say no.

                        JESS
            I am.

                        DESI
            That it?

                        JESS
            Yeah.

  But everyone stands there awkwardly for a moment...

                      JESS (CONT'D)
            Oh, Bob, tell Desi that thing you
            were saying before.

  BOB's now on the spot. He doesn't want to do this.

                        BOB
                  (pause)
            Me?

                        JESS
            Yeah.

                        BOB
            Really?

                        DESI
            Guys?

                      JESS
            It was interesting. Bob was saying
            that you're really the title
            character of the show. Because
            you're the "I" in I Love Lucy.

                  (pause)
            Hm.

                      JESS
            So strictly speaking, you have top
            billing.

                      DESI
                (pause)
            I'm the "I" in I Love Lucy.

                         JESS
            Yeah.

                      DESI
            I never thought of it that way.

                      JESS
            You like that?

                      DESI
            I like that.

                         JESS
            Alright.

                         DESI
            Jess?

                         JESS
            Yeah.

                      DESI
                (confidentially)
            Patronize me again and I'll stick
            my hand down your throat and pull
            your fuckin' lungs out.

                      JESS
                (pause)
            Look--

  MISS ROSEN, Desi's secretary, comes in with a telegram.

                         MISS ROSEN
            Excuse me.

                      JESS
            What is it?

                      MISS ROSEN
            It's a telegram for Mr. Arnaz. It's
            from Mr. Lyons and Philip Morris.

                  Thank you.

        DESI opens the telegram, reads it and hands it to JESS. DESI
        walks away as he calls out--

                            DESI (CONT'D)

                  Let's go, please, we're an hour

                            MADELYN
                  What does it say?

                            JESS
                  "To all Philip Morris and CBS
                  employees: Don't fuck with the
                  Cuban."


104     EXT./EST. LUCY AND DESI'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    104

        The house is mostly dark with only a few lights on.


105     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT                                  105

        LUCY has a basket of laundry in front of her. She's
        separating whites and colors while working on her lines.

                            LUCY
                      (as "LUCY")
                  "Well he didn't come home and he
                  hasn't called...
                      ("choking up")
                  ...not that it makes any difference
                  to me."
                      (as "ETHEL")
                  "Oh I can see that it doesn't make
                  any difference to you. Why don't
                  you call Ricky and tell him you're
                  sorry."
                      (as "LUCY")
                  "What?! You think I'd allow my
                  pride--"

        LUCY checks her script--

  DESI appears in the doorway, holding their sleeping TWO YEAR-
  OLD GIRL on his shoulders.

                      DESI
                (quietly)
            Never.

                      LUCY
            Oh, what are you doing up?

                      DESI
            I woke up and you weren't there. So
            I went to the nursery to see if
            everything was okay. She'd kicked
            her blanket off so I fixed it. That
            woke her up.

                      LUCY
            Yeah.

                      DESI
            But as you can see, I got her back
            to sleep and we went searching for
            mama. You know we pay a housekeeper
            to do the laundry.

                      LUCY
            I like doing laundry and I never
            get a chance. Don't you love the
            smell?

                      DESI
            I do. They should make a cologne
            that smells like soap.

                      LUCY
            They do. It's soap.

                      DESI
            I'm gonna put her back in her
            little apartment now. You should
            come to bed.

                       LUCY
            I will.
                (beat)
            This was a nice date.

  DESI smiles and nods...

                      DESI
            Come back to bed soon.

  DESI exits.

        LUCY resumes sorting the laundry and running lines...

                            LUCY
                  "Do you think I'd call him and go
                  crawling back?"
                      (again)
                  "What?! Do you think I'd swallow my
                  pride?! Do you think I'd call him
                  and go crawling--"

        LUCY notices something in the laundry basket...

                            LUCY (CONT'D)
                      (mindlessly, as "LUCY")
                  "What? Do you think I'd swallow my
                  pride like that?"

        She's looking at a handkerchief that was in the laundry
        basket. We can't see what's caught her attention but
        something's bothering her.


106     EXT. LUCY AND DESI'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          106

        It's raining. LUCY walks out the back door, down past the
        pool and leans against the gate, looking back at her house.
        She stares.


107     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT                                     107

        A cigarette is lit and from the light of the flame we see
        LUCY sitting in the Ricardo's living room.

        After a moment, the heavy elephant door opens and headlights
        from a car stream into the soundstage. We can see from the
        headlights that it's still raining. The headlights are turned
        off and we hear a car door open and then close.

  set.

            What the hell?

                      LUCY
            Thanks for coming down.

                      FRAWLEY
            It's two in the morning.

                      LUCY
            Sorry about that.

                      FRAWLEY
            Kid, what's goin' on?

                      LUCY
            I'm gonna re-stage the dinner
            scene.

                       FRAWLEY
            Let's go to my dressing room and
            call Desi.

                      LUCY
            No, Desi's home with the baby, we
            can do this.

                      FRAWLEY
            Does he know you're here?

                      LUCY
            He's sleeping.

                      FRAWLEY
            Let me take you home.

  Another pair of headlights pull up to the open elephant door.

                      FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
            Is that him?

                      LUCY
            That's Viv.

                      FRAWLEY
            You called her too?

            I'm re-staging the dinner scene.
            This isn't for beginners, you know,
            this isn't school.

                      FRAWLEY
            I don't hire the directors.

                      LUCY
            I know, I'm just sayin'.

                      VIVIAN
            What's happening here?

                      LUCY
            Thanks for coming, Viv.

                      VIVIAN
            Is everything alright?

                      FRAWLEY
            The three of us are on an empty
            soundstage at two in the morning,
            she's drunk, I'm not, so, yeah,
            everything's good, why do you ask?

                      VIVIAN
            Your call just said to come to the
            stage, that it was an emergency. So
            I thought--

                      LUCY
            We need to re-block the dinner
            scene, it's not gonna take long.

                      VIVIAN
            What?

                      FRAWLEY
            You heard her right.

                      LUCY
            It won't take long, we're just
            gonna make an adjustment.

  LUCY pulls the drop cloth off the dining table.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            Two people who are fighting have to
            share a seat at a dinner table.

  LUCY grabs the downstage piano bench--
                                                      126.

                            LUCY (CONT'D)
                  First thing, why don't we take this
                  and move it upstage so the camera
                  can see you.

                            VIVIAN
                  Are we really doing this?

                            FRAWLEY
                  As a matter of fact, putting the
                  chair upstage makes sense.

                            LUCY
                  Sit please.

                            VIVIAN
                  Which one of us?

                            LUCY
                  Both of you. In the chair.

        VIVIAN and FRAWLEY each take half the piano bench.

                             LUCY (CONT'D)
                  Now it can't just be a mish-mash of
                  pushing, it can't just be a scrum,
                  each move has to be articulate. So
                  Ethel elbows Fred.
                      (beat)
                  Elbow him.

            Yeah, I just wanted to fix this
            beat. I couldn't sleep. It's like
            when you're not sure if you left
            the oven unlocked. Door unlocked.
            Nothing, I wanted to fix this beat.

            You know I did this show so Desi
            and I could be together? I had no
            idea it was gonna be a hit.
            I just thought...well, the
            construction department's gonna
            build us a little apartment and
            that's where we'll live most of the
            time. You know? And it worked out.
            This is where--

  LUCY draws the set in the air with her finger...

                       LUCY (CONT'D)
            It's like a story you'd read a
            little girl. A witch puts a curse
            on a woman. She'll be adored by the
            man she loves, but only as long as
            she stays on this patch of ground.
                (beat)
            It's still a lot more than most
            people get. Let's run it at speed.

                      FRAWLEY
            I'm gonna drive you home.

            I'm the biggest asset in the
            portfolio of the Columbia
            Broadcasting System. The biggest
            asset in the portfolio of Philip
            Morris Tobacco, Westinghouse...I
            get paid a fortune to do exactly
            what I love doing, I work side by
            side with my husband who's
            genuinely impressed by me, and all
            I have to do to keep it is kill
            every week for thirty-six weeks in
            a row. And then do it again the
            next year. Kill. So let's do it
            again.

                   I thought he'd like the idea that
                   he was the title character. That he

                   After RKO dropped Lucy's contract,
                   MGM had her in for a Technicolor
                   test, which she didn't know yet
                   would be one of the most important
                   moments in her life. A man named
                   Sydney Guilaroff was Metro's chief
                   hair stylist. He looked at Lucy and
                   said, "The hair is brown but the
                   soul is on fire" and he dyed her
                   hair a new color.

                  Pass it on to Maddie and Bob, would

            and I've never heard of either of
            you.

            I'm kidding.

            Understood.

            That was funny.

                         LUCY
            Thank you.

                      JESS
            These men have an interesting idea.

                      LUCY
            Would you like to sit?

            Thank you.

            Lucy, we've been here to the show a
            few times now, and we noticed--
            well, David noticed--

                      HART
            You noticed too.

                  gestures and expressions.

                            LUCY
                      (pause)
                  You mean the acting?

                            LEVY
                  Yeah.

                            LUCY
                  My face, my body and my voice,
                  that's all I get to work with.

                            HART
                  It's just unusual because it's
                  radio.

                            LUCY
                  I watched Jack Benny. He plays it
                  for the studio audience and it
                  works pretty well for him.

                             LEVY
                  It does, and it works pretty well
                  for you too. Very well. And we
                  think it's a shame that no one gets
                  to see it.

                            LUCY
                  Invent a way to see what's on the
                  radio.

                            HART
                  We did, it's television.

                            LUCY
                  Are you here to sell me one?

                            JESS
                  Lucy--they want to put My Favorite
                  Husband on TV.


119     INT. CBS COMMISSARY - DAY                                   119

        LUCY's having lunch with LEVY, HART and JESS, along with
        HOWARD and ROGER, the two executives we met earlier.              *

                            LUCY
                  I'm very interested.

                            ROGER
                  That's great.

                            LEVY                                           *
                  Is it too early to raise a glass?

                            HOWARD
                  To My Favorite Husband.

                            LUCY
                  Yes! Except I don't want to do My                        *
                  Favorite Husband.

                            HOWARD                                         *
                      (pause)
                  I'm confused.

                            JESS
                  Yeah, me too.

                            LUCY
                  Don't panic. It's simple. I'm
                  interested in your idea of doing My
                  Favorite Husband on television, I
                  just want it to be a different
                  show.

                            JESS
                  What show do you want it to be?

                            LUCY
                  One where Desi plays my husband.


120     INT. CBS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                               120

        LUCY, JESS and the executives from lunch have now been joined
        by more executives, including MACY, an even bigger wig than
        the big-wigs she's been meeting with. They're all sitting
        around a very long table with LUCY at one end and MACY on the
        other.

                            MACY
                  I understand there's a casting
                  issue.

                            LUCY
                      (pause)
                  Was that to me?

                            MACY
                  Yes.

                      LUCY
            I wasn't sure, you're quite a ways
            away.

                      HART
            Our casting department has come up
            with a list of very exciting names
            we think you'll like. Could you
            pass this down to Lucy.

                      LEVY
            These are all very funny men.

                      HART
            I think we have mimeos for
            everyone.

  The casting list starts getting handed out--

                      LEVY
            It's one of the best lists I've
            seen in a while.

                      LUCY
            Number 12 died last week.

                      HART
            That's my fault.

                      LUCY
            There's no issue.

                      HOWARD
            What was that?

                      LUCY
                (louder)
            I was answering Mr. Macy. There's
            no casting issue. I am ready and
            eager to do a half-hour domestic
            comedy for CBS if the role of my
            husband--let's call him Shmezy--is
            played by Desi.

                      HOWARD                                      *
            Can I remark on this?                                 *

                      ROGER
            Please.

                       HOWARD                                     *
            On My Favorite Husband, your
            husband is the 5th Vice President
            of a bank.

Continued: 120

                      LUCY
            Yes.

                      HOWARD                                       *
            Can I ask you, in all candor, do
            you see Desi as the 5th Vice
            President of a bank?

                      LUCY
            I can't see him being the 5th Vice
            President of anything. I can see
            him owning the bank.

                      ROGER
            You see the problem?

                      LUCY
            I see what you think is the
            problem.

                      MACY
            Lucy.

                      LUCY
            Yes.

                      MACY
            I don't ordinarily come to meetings
            like this. I don't pay attention to
            casting issues. This meeting is
            several floors below my general
            interest. I'm here to deliver a
            hard truth. We can't have an all-
            American girl married to a man who
            isn't American.

                      LUCY
            He is American. He was a sergeant
            in the U.S. Army and he served in
            the war.

                      MACY
            You know exactly what I mean, Lucy,
            he's Spanish.

                      LUCY
            Still no. He's never been to Spain
            in his life. He speaks Spanish. He
            was born in Cuba. His father was
            the Mayor of Santiago, Cuba's
            second largest city.

                      MACY
            You know exactly--
                                                    137.
      Continued: 120

                            LUCY
                  --what you mean, yes I do. Look,
                  I'm not here trying to get a job
                  for my nephew. Desi Arnaz is a
                  phenomenally talented man. Not just
                  a world-class musician but a very
                  good actor who would be a movie
                  star if there was such a thing as a
                  Cuban movie star. Moreover we work
                  very well together. I go out and
                  meet him when he's touring and he
                  brings me up for some sketches and
                  it works. Jess?

                              JESS
                  It works.

                            LUCY
                  Any cultural differences will make
                  for good comedy, am I right Jess?

                            JESS
                  You're not wrong.

                            LUCY
                  Now I don't want to have another
                  meeting like this because I don't
                  know how many more people will fit
                  around a table. My position's not
                  going to change. You want me on
                  television and there's only one
                  television show I'm willing to do,
                  so what's it gonna be?

        There's silence around the table for a moment, and then--

        The I LOVE LUCY THEME MUSIC crashes in.




        TITLE:

                              Friday

                         Show Night


121     INT. I LOVE LUCY SET - NIGHT                                121

        A live orchestra is playing the theme music. The bleachers
        are filled with an excited audience and there's pre-show
        activity from the crew.
                                        Yellow Rev. (03/28/21)   138.
      Continued: 121

        We see eight empty seats in the back row with reserved signs
        being taped on them.


122     INT. LUCY'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME                      122

        LUCY, who's hair and make-up are now done up as "Lucy", is
        finishing putting her costume on with the help of a dresser.
        P.A. SCOTT pops his head in--

                            SCOTT
                  We think it's about 15 minutes.

                              LUCY
                  We think?

                            SCOTT
                  We're holding for something, I'm
                  not sure what.

                            LUCY
                  Okay, thanks.

         P.A. SCOTT pops back out.

                              LUCY (CONT'D)
                  Holding?

        JESS taps on the open door.

                            LUCY (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, come in.
                      (to the DRESSER)
                  Can I have a second?

                              DRESSER
                  Sure.

        The DRESSER exits.

                            JESS
                  I think I know why you want to see
                  me.

                              LUCY
                  Do you?

                            JESS
                  Hear me out.

                            LUCY
                  I asked you a favor, Jess. I asked
                  you to give him an E.P. credit.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            Instead, you tried to convince him
            he was the title character or some--

                       JESS
            Listen--

                      LUCY
            --bullshit. What the hell was that?

                      JESS
            I'm sorry if he was insulted. I
            mean, I know he's insulted so I'm
            sorry.

                      LUCY
            He wasn't insulted, he was laughing
            about it. But yeah, he's insulted.
            No, he's offended, I'm insulted. I
            asked you to do a small favor--

                       JESS
            Yeah.

                      LUCY
            --and it's not like you don't owe
            me a couple.

  JESS takes a deep breath before--

                      JESS
            It wasn't a small favor and I don't
            know what you think I owe you.

                       LUCY
            Really?

                      JESS
            It wasn't a small favor, you asked
            me to save your marriage.

                       LUCY
            No, I--

                      JESS
            And it's not the first time you've
            asked me to do that, is it?

                      LUCY
            I asked you to give him an E.P.
            credit, that's all.

                      JESS
            No problem. Can my wife play Lucy
            once in a while?

Continued: 122

                      LUCY
            If your wife played Lucy once in a
            while, I'd think it would be
            appropriate that she be so
            credited. And what do you mean it's
            not the first time I asked you to
            save--

                       JESS
            "Jess, Jessie, we'll have Desi play
            my husband. It'll save my
            marriage."

                      LUCY
            Was that supposed to be me?

                      JESS
            Yes.

                      LUCY
            Don't do voices.

                      JESS
            You're insulted? Desi's offended?
            You asked me to give away my job
            title like it was a parking spot.

                      LUCY
            You're right, I'm sorry.

                      JESS
            Jesus Christ, Lucy, sometimes I
            think, wait, what?

                      LUCY
            You're right. And I'm sorry. I was
            dead wrong.

                      JESS
                (pause)
            I wasn't expecting that.

                      LUCY
            I know.

                      JESS
            Have you ever said that to me
            before?

                      LUCY
            I doubt it. But I've thought it if
            that means anything.

                         JESS
              It does.

                         LUCY
              It's just been a compound fracture
              of a week.

                         JESS
              You want to hear something stupid?
              I think I've been mad at you this
              week because you're not Jewish. If
              it had been me, I'd have been fired
              two minutes after the words came
              out of Winchell's mouth.
                  (beat)
              I told you it was stupid.

  LUCY takes that in...and then decides to make a joke...

                        LUCY
              And you didn't disappoint.

  JESS smiles--

                        JESS
              Good show tonight.

                         LUCY
              Good show.
                  (then)
              Hey, why are we holding?

                        JESS
              I'm not sure.

                        LUCY
              We're holding, someone must know
              why.

  There's a   KNOCK on the door.

                         LUCY (CONT'D)
              Come in.

   P.A. SCOTT sticks his head in--

                        SCOTT
              Desi's asking to see you in his
              office.

                        LUCY
              You mean his dressing room?

                            SCOTT
                  No, he's in his office with some
                  CBS executives and some men from
                  Philip-Morris.

        SCOTT exits...

                            JESS
                  Why's he in his office at show
                  time?

                            LUCY
                      (pause)
                  Because the evening editions just
                  came out.


        LUCY looks at JESS...They both know this can only mean
        trouble.

                             JESS
                      (pause)
                  Listen to me. Memorize this. "It's
                  none of your fuckin' business."
                      (beat)
                  There. Let that be the best thing I
                  ever wrote.

        LUCY smiles...nods...then says--

                            LUCY
                      (pause)
                  Nah. It's still "vitameatavegamin."

        LUCY heads out and JESS follows her.


123     INT. DESI'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   123

        DESI stands behind his desk and the men are all silent. LUCY
        and JESS come in.

                            DESI
                  The evening edition.

        DESI shows LUCY the front page of the Los Angeles Herald-
        Express. There's a four-inch headline in red ink: LUCILLE
        BALL A RED.

        LUCY let's it sink in and then has an involuntary sharp
        intake of breath. DESI takes her hand--

                            DESI (CONT'D)
                  It's alright.

                      LUCY
            It's in four-inch type.

                      DESI
            I'm gonna fix this.

                      LUCY
            That's Hindenburg type.

                      DESI
            I've already made the calls.

                      LUCY
            And they used red ink.

                      DESI
            Yeah.
                                                143.

                      LUCY
            I didn't even know newspapers had
            red ink.

                      DESI
            I guess they do.

                      LUCY
            I was cleared.

                      DESI
            Somehow the city editor, a woman
            named Agnes Underwood, has a
            photostatic copy of the affidavit
            showing you registered in 1936 as a
            voter intending to affiliate with
            the Communist Party.

                      LUCY
            But I was cleared. After the
            testimony they stamped "canceled"
            on the card, I saw the card.

                      DESI
            Other papers are showing the
            canceled card and they're running a
            caption that says, "Note the
            cancellation at left", but the
            Herald-Express took the word
            "canceled" out of the document
            altogether.

                      LUCY
            Other papers?

                      DESI
            Yes, but I've made calls and we're
            taking care of this.
                (calling)
            Miss Rosen!

                      LUCY
            Calls to who?

                      DESI
            Every reporter within 20 minutes of
            this soundstage. That's why we're
            holding.

                      LUCY
            You're saying the reporters are
            coming here?

  MISS ROSEN steps in and waits for instructions.
                                                144.

                       DESI
            We'll seat them in the back of the
            bleachers.

                      LUCY
            You think we're still filming a
            show?
                (to the EXECUTIVES)
            Why are none of you talking?

                      ROGER
            It's Desi's idea.

                      DESI
            I'm gonna warm up the audience the
            way I always do, except instead of
            Cuban Pete and the joke about the
            turtle, I'm going to tell them what
            happened. I'm going to explain that
            you checked the wrong box, I'm
            going to show them the cancelled
            document, and then I'm going to
            bring you out so the press sees
            them give you a round of applause.

                      LUCY
            Fellas, could we have the room for
            just a moment?

  Everyone steps out but LUCY and DESI. They're silent for a
  moment before...

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
            You're not telling these people I
            checked the wrong box.

                      DESI
            This is a critical moment.

                      LUCY
            If I'm gonna die--

                      DESI
            You're not.

                      LUCY
            I'd rather die standing up.

                      DESI
            I don't have any idea what that--

                      LUCY
            I'm not an idiot, I didn't check
            the wrong--

                      DESI
            You saw the headline.

                      LUCY
            You can see that headline from
            outer space.

                      DESI
            Then please--

                      LUCY
            Grandpa Fred raised me from age
            eleven. He cared about the little
            guy, he cared about workers'
            rights. It was a tribute to him and
            to say I checked the wrong--

                      DESI
            Grandpa Fred, Grandpa Fred, Grandpa
            Fred was wrong, Lucy! `Cause he
            didn't tell you the part where they
            throw your father in prison for the
            crime of being the mayor of a city.
            I was chased to this country!
            Believe me, you checked the wrong
            box.

  LUCY takes a long moment...

                      LUCY
            And what if they don't applaud?

                      DESI
            They will. And the press will write
            that they did.

                      LUCY
            You're going to tell them that I
            was accused of--sixteen years ago--

                       DESI
            They're going to read it in the
            morning anyway. We have a sample
            population of two-hundred people on
            our stage.
                (calling out)
            Miss Rosen!

                      LUCY
            If they boo me--
                                                     146.

                  tonight.

        MISS ROSEN comes back in--

        DESI's gotten a small black address book out of his desk and
        opened to a page. He shows it to his secretary and points to
        a name--

                            DESI (CONT'D)
                  Call this man. Tell them it's for
                  me, they'll find him, he's
                  expecting my call. Tell me when you
                  have him.

        MISS ROSEN takes the phone book and walks out.


124     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT                 124

        LUCY is leaning against a wall in a private spot, smoking a
        cigarette. We can see the lit "Desilu" sign in the distance.
        She takes a deep breath to settle herself.

        After a moment, a heavy steel door opens. VIVIAN looks in one
        direction and then the other and sees LUCY. She steps out--

                            VIVIAN
                  Someone said they spotted you going
                  out here.

                            LUCY
                  This was our pre-show spot, you and
                  me. All last season, you remember?

                            VIVIAN
                  Yeah. We should do that again, I
                  liked that tradition.

        LUCY nods...


                             VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                  I was just told. Jesus, Lulu. Four-
                  inch type?

                             LUCY
                  Red ink.

                            VIVIAN
                  How did they get it wrong?

            Well...I mean...they didn't.

                      VIVIAN
            Grandpa Fred?

  LUCY nods...

                      VIVIAN (CONT'D)
            You're the most beloved woman in
            America. You're not gonna get
            blacklisted.

                       LUCY
            Aww, Viv. You know how many brands
            Philip Morris owns? All it takes is
            someone calling for a boycott of
            Marlboros.

                      VIVIAN
                (pause)
            I shouldn't have piled on this
            week. It just--

  VIVIAN shakes her head and waves it off...

                      LUCY
            What?

                      VIVIAN
            None of that matters right now.

                      LUCY
            It may be the last time we're out
            here. Say it.

                      VIVIAN
            Lucy Ricardo's married to a man six
            years younger than she is and
            Ethel's married to her grandfather.
            And it's understood, as the
            underlying premise for a running
            joke, that I'm not pretty enough
            for him. It got to me and at the
            world's worst time.

  LUCY nods her head, she understands...

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            That was a knockout dress.

  The heavy steel door opens and FRAWLEY steps out with
  MADELYN...

                      FRAWLEY
            Oh. You two wanna be alone?

                       VIVIAN/LUCY
            Yes./No.

  MADELYN hurries over to LUCY and speaks to her privately.

                      MADELYN
                (quietly)
            You're my hero.

                      LUCY
                (pause)
            I care about what works, Maddie. I
            care about what's funny. I don't
            see myself caring about a woman's
            perspective from a new generation.
            I care about you.

  After a moment...

                       FRAWLEY
            I'd love for someone to bring me
            breakfast.

                      MADELYN
            That's not what we were talking
            about.

                       LUCY
            Doesn't a P.A. bring you breakfast
            every day?

                       FRAWLEY
            Yes.

                       LUCY
            Okay.

                      FRAWLEY
            Never French toast.

                      LUCY
            We'll look into that.

                      FRAWLEY
            I came out to try to distract you
            with nonsense but I assume these
            two beat me to it.

                      LUCY
            Viv doesn't like the jokes about
            Ethel being unappealing.

                      FRAWLEY
            Yeah, there's no one within the
            sound of her voice who doesn't know
            that.

                      VIVIAN
            I said what I felt.

                      FRAWLEY
            You've been saying what you felt
            since the first day of work, it's
            not like you've finally given voice
            to your feelings. You know what,
            sweet ladies? Something dies inside
            a man--it just dies--the first time
            he hears a girl call him old. So on
            the subject of Jess, Bob and
            Madelyn writing "Ethel" jokes, I'm
            indifferent.

                       LUCY
            The two of you...
                (beat)
            ...are good actors. It's a
            privilege doing this show with you.

  There's a long silence before...

                      FRAWLEY
            Now you're scaring the shit outa
            me.

                       VIVIAN
                (over)
            I was just gonna say.

                        LUCY
            Desi's gonna tell the audience.
            He's invited press. He's betting
            the audience will accept the truth,
            give their approval and the press
            will write about it.
                 (beat)
            I'd take the other side of that
            bet.

  The steel door opens and P.A. SCOTT sticks his head out--

                      SCOTT
            Excuse me. Sorry. Mr. Arnaz is
            ready to do the warm-up. They told
            me you wanted to know.

                  Alright, I'll see you out there.
                  Good show.

                               FRAWLEY
                  Good show.

                               MADELYN
                  Good show.

        VIVIAN and MADELYN go inside. LUCY starts to head in but
        FRAWLEY puts a hand out to stop her...

                            FRAWLEY
                      (pause)
                  The dinner scene is inarguably
                  better.

        LUCY smiles...then heads inside.


125     INT. SOUNDSTAGE/I LOVE LUCY SET - NIGHT                    125

        The orchestra's finishing a number as we see an USHER seating
        a few members of the press in the last row where other
        members of the press are sitting.

        DESI watches the press being seated from backstage.

        The audience APPLAUDS at the end of the number...

                            ANNOUNCER
                  Now ladies and gentlemen, give a
                  warm welcome to one of the stars of
                  I Love Lucy. You know him as Ricky
                  Ricardo--here's Desi Arnaz!

        A healthy round of applause greets DESI as he walks onto the
        set carrying a folded newspaper.

                            DESI
                  Thank you, thank you very much.
                      (pause)
                  Usually, right now, I'd be doing
                  the final audience warm-up. I'd
                  tell you an old joke about a
                  turtle. I'd point out our
                  groundbreaking camera system that
                  allows the studio audience to watch
                  the show unobstructed and I'd
                  introduce you to the rest of the
                  cast.

  We see LUCY watching from an off-stage vantage point. At
  various times we'll see FRAWLEY or VIVIAN, JESS, MADELYN,
  BOB, MARY PAT, the network guys or A P.A. watching from
  various places around the stage.

                       DESI (CONT'D)
            I'm not doing that tonight and
            here's why. Last week, my wife,
            Lucille Ball, was asked to testify
            in front of a closed session of the
            House Un-American Activities
            Committee.

  There's a murmur in the audience...

                      DESI (CONT'D)
            Yeah, the congressmen who
            investigate Communism. After hours
            of testimony, the committee
            concluded, unambiguously, that Lucy
            was and is in no way involved with
            the Communist Party. So
            everything's swell, right? No.
            Because this is the evening edition
            headline in the Herald-Express.

  DESI opens the paper and shows them the headline. The
  AUDIENCE GASPS...

                      DESI (CONT'D)
            So I made some phone calls. I
            called the editor of the Herald-
            Express. I called the chairman of
            the committee. I called all the
            members of the committee. And I
            made one more call to someone and I
            believe he's still on the line.

  DESI is handed a phone by MISS ROSEN. He'll speak into the
  phone and then hold the receiver up to the microphone so the
  audience can hear.

                      DESI (CONT'D)
                (into the phone)
            Are you still with me, sir?

                      MAN (V.O.)
            Yes.

                (into the phone)
            I'm now standing in front of a
            studio audience in Hollywood,
            California, and we're joined by a
            number of members of the press.
                                               152.

                      MAN (V.O.)
            That's fine.

                      DESI
                (into the phone)
            We want to know, sir, does the FBI
            have any case against Lucy? Does
            the FBI have any evidence of
            wrongdoing? Does the FBI have any
            reason to believe that Lucille Ball
            is a Communist?

                      MAN (V.O.)
            No. Absolutely nothing. She is one-
            hundred percent clear.

                      DESI
                (into phone)
            Thank you, sir. One more question.
            Would you tell us your name please?

                      MAN (V.O.)
            This is J. Edgar Hoover.

  An impressed reaction from the AUDIENCE...

                      DESI
            Thank you, sir, enjoy your evening.
                (he hangs up)
            Ladies and gentlemen, please
            welcome my wife and the star of I
            Love Lucy, Lucille Ball.

  The audience breaks into THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and CHEERING.
  Backstage, LUCY breathes a sigh of relief, takes a moment,
  and walks onto the set.

  The audience gives her a STANDING OVATION.

  DESI looks up to the last row where he sees the reporters
  feverishly writing all this down. He cathes the eye of one
  reporter who's taking it all in but not writing it down and
  he pantomimes, "Write it the hell down."

  Backstage, people are shaking hands.

  LUCY gives a final wave to the audience and walks off.

  DESI shouts over the SUSTAINED APPLAUSE

                      DESI (CONT'D)
                (shouting)
            So enjoy the show.

        The orchestra crashes into a new number as DESI heads
        offstage a moment later and takes us--


126     INT. BEHIND THE SET - CONTINUOUS                         126

        --where he takes LUCY in his arms. They have to speak up to
        be heard over the orchestra--

                            DESI
                  It's all over.

                               LUCY
                  Thank you.

                            DESI
                  It's over now.

                               LUCY
                  Thank you.

                            DESI
                  They love you.

                            LUCY
                  I love you.

                            DESI
                  No one's gonna mess with you. Ever.

                            LUCY
                  I thought they were gonna boo.

                            DESI
                  You wanna do a show?

                      LUCY
            When you stay out all night you're
            on the boat playing cards?

                      DESI
            Yes.

                      LUCY
            You haven't been with anyone else?

                      DESI
            What's going on with you?

                      LUCY
            Don't gaslight me.

                      DESI
            Where did this come from? They just
            cheered for you.

                      LUCY
            They got it right, didn't they?

                      DESI
            Lucy--

                      LUCY
            They only got the picture wrong.
            Did they get it right? Did they get
            it exactly right?

                      DESI
            Jesus Christ, I just proved that
            the Herald-Express got it wrong,
            you think Confidential Magazine--
            we're about to do a show.

                      LUCY
            Just tell me.

                      DESI
            Tell me why you think--other than
            this garbage--tell me why you think
            I've--

  LUCY takes out a white handkerchief that has a lipstick
  smudge on it.

  DESI takes a long moment...

            That's your lipstick. Remember? At
            the beginning of the week you
            kissed me, then took my
            handkerchief and wiped the lipstick
            off and put it back in my pocket.
            And you said you'd never done that
            before.

                        LUCY
            I hadn't.

                      DESI
            Then what the hell are we talking
            about?

  LUCY takes out another handkerchief that also has a lipstick
  smudge...

                      LUCY
            This is my lipstick.

  There's a long silence while DESI makes up his mind...

                      DESI
                (pause)
            They were just call girls. They're
            hookers. It doesn't mean anything.

  LUCY nods...

            Look--

            Jim, let's go. It's not gonna get
            better than this.

  We see and/or hear the show revving up--"Quiet Please!"

                   It ended up being a good show that
                   night. We did both versions of the

                   version that made it on the air.

                   For the record, I won my bet with
                   Desi. CBS wouldn't let us use the
                   word "pregnant". But more people
                   watched the birth of Little Ricky
                   than had ever watched a television

                            OLDER JESS
                  She was doing the bit with the
                  flowers, which we couldn't use
                  `cause we were running long--


133     EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY                               133

                            OLDER MADELYN
                  It seemed like she just got lost in
                  her own head for second.


134     INT. I LOVE LUCY SET/- NIGHT (BACK AND WHITE)       134

        LUCY trims the stem of one of the flowers.

                            OLDER MADELYN
                  It may have been the only time she
                  went up on a line.


136     INT. I LOVE LUCY SET - NIGHT (BLACK AND WHITE)              136

        LUCY clips another stem, puts it back and now all the flowers
        disappear into the vase to a HUGE LAUGH.


137     INT. NIGHT CLUB - DAY                                       137

                            OLDER BOB
                  She takes the water glass and pours
                  more water into the vase--


138     INT. SOUNDSTAGE BLEACHERS - DAY                             138

                            OLDER JESS
                  --which makes all of the flowers
                  come up to the surface--


139     INT. I LOVE LUCY SET - NIGHT (BLACK AND WHITE)              139

        The flowers come up to the surface which gets a big LAUGH
        from the audience.

                            OLDER BOB
                  And then--I can't remember the
                  first line but we had to stop and
                  go again.


141     INT. SOUNDSTAGE BLEACHERS - DAY                             141

                            OLDER JESS
                  I can't remember what her cue was,
                  only that Lucy had her back to the
                  audience and from where I was
                  standing I thought I saw her--it
                  was a long time ago, but I thought
                  I saw her smile or even laugh a
                  little and then just get lost.

                             OLDER MADELYN
                       (remembering)
                   It was Desi's line. It was the new
                   bit Lucy put in but that version
                   never made it into the show.
                       (trying to remember)
                   What was his line?


143      INT. I LOVE LUCY SET - NIGHT                                 143

         DESI enters. He stands there, unnoticed by Lucy...then--

                             DESI
                   Lucy, I'm home!

         And LUCY hears that, smiles and revels in it for a quick
         moment and laughs a little...there's an awkward silence.

                             LUCY
                   Sorry about that, I got lost for a
                   second.

                   We never went back to do another
                   take of the alternate opening. Lucy
                   just wanted to move on.


143B     INT. I LOVE LUCY SET/LIVING ROOM                            143B

         As the show re-starts, with the audience loving every moment,
         we start to slowly PULL BACK and PULL UP.

         The show continues semi-MOS as we pull back further and
         higher, so that what we're looking at is obviously a set. A
         small set. Three flats and no ceiling. Stagehands are smoking
         and talking to each other backstage with LUCY commanding her
         small, fictional world.

         We're up above the light grid now--

        The morning after Lucy and Desi shot their final show
        together, Lucy filed for divorce.
