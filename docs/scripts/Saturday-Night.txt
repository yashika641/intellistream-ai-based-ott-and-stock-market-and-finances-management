   The following movie takes place in real time between
10:00pm and 11:30pm on October 11th, 1975. The audience is
 a fly on the wall for this straight shot roller coaster,
all leading to the very first declaration by Chevy Chase -
       "Live From New York, It's Saturday Night!" 

  We will film as an ensemble inside a living/breathing
fully recreated Studio 8H at Rockefeller Center. The tone
  is hyperreal and should be brought to life with wild-
    hearted abandon for the cast and crew that changed
                   television forever.

    EXECUTIVE OFFICE - ROCKEFELLER CENTER

    A Brazilian rosewood CABINET TELEVISION. A well used crystal
    decanter on top. The light is moody. The legs of unknown
    EXECUTIVES pass in front of camera.

    On screen - the ORIGINAL SCREEN TESTS for SNL. Pieces of
    Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Laraine Newman,
    Garret Morris, Jane Curtin, and Dan Aykroyd. It's loose and
    freestyle. Their names are identif ied with chyrons.

    We hear snippets of the executives speaking, but it's mostly
    background noise. Something about the Tonight Show ratings
    and the Saturday numbers.

    Every once in a while, a comment about the screen test...
    Jesus, where'd you find this guy... Nice face. Real downtown
    look... She's cute, is she dating someone...?

    50TH STREET. UNDER THE MARQUEE. OCTOBER 11TH, 1975

    The sound of New Yor k City hits us like a punch to the face.

    The sidewalk is awash with trash bags from the garbage
    strike. Families fleeing Broadway shows desperately searching
    for taxis as others in trench coats are drawn towards the
    tenderloin of Time Square. Cops and vagrants don't pay each
    other any mind. Traffic moves forward in violent jolts.

    Amongst the chaos, a young man in a sports coat stands on the
    curb, ch ecking his watch. LORNE MICHAELS, 29 years old. It's
    night, but he's sweating.

    From a cab radio-- At the sound of the tone, the time will be
    10pm... Boop.

    SOMETHING AFLAME floats from above. Lorne clocks - SHEAFS OF
    PAPER ON FIRE, fluttering down. As they land, Lorne stamps
    them out, bewildered.

    We clock a scraggly NBC PAGE mindlessly handing out flyers.

                         NBC PAGE
              Free show... Free show... Plenty of
              sea ts... Hey, check it out.

    Lorne takes a flyer. Clearly the first time seeing it. Yikes.

                        LORNE
              How's it coming?
                                                              123.

Yeah, not good. What kind of      No, it's not... There is no

Saturday?                         in...

Oh, far out, man! Congrats!

                    NBC PAGE (CONT'D)
          Does it have a name? Cause I don't
          know what to tell people...

                    LORNE
          The show? It's called Saturday
          Night.

                       NBC PAGE
              (beat)
          I like it.

                    LORNE
          What are you telling people?

                                              LORNE (CONT'D)
            NBC PAGE
   (reads from placard)           A parade? Truly? A parade?
"You are invited to a new         Was clown car under
variety spectacular,              copyright? Did some genius
featuring a parade of comedy      beat us to goat rodeo?
and musical acts ripped from         (done)

   (acting)
Where did they unearth such a
cavalcade of talent?"

                    NBC PAGE (CONT'D)
          So, if this show is about to go
          live, what are you doing down here?

                    LORNE
          Looking for one of the most
          brilliant entertainers of our time.

Just then a well-worn brown Jaguar stops mid traffic. CAR
HORNS immediately. ANDY KAUFMAN steps out carrying a portable
record player.

             LORNE (CONT'D)                    ANDY
It' s 10pm Andy...                   (already in character)
                                  Hello Mr. Michaels.

MORE CAR HORNS.

                        2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                        LORNE (CONT'D)
                  (into traffic)
              He's just getting out...
                  (ironic)
              Thank you for your patience.

    From the driver's seat, Andy's mom MRS. KAUFMAN calls out --

             MRS. KAUFMAN                        ANDY
    Where can I park?               Do you like my suit?

                        LORNE
              Very elegant, Andy.
                  (to Mom)
              You can pick him up at one, Mrs.
              Kaufman!

                                                LORNE (CONT'D)
             MRS. KAUFMAN
    Take care of my Andy!           Yes, Mrs. Kaufman.

    The Jaguar pulls away. We follow Lorne and Andy up to...

    30 ROCK LOBBY

    Sudd en quiet. Now gliding. Lorne leads Andy through the
    revolving door into the marble elegance of 30 Rock.

    Andy straggles, awed by the splendor of the Art Deco lobby. A
    janitor waxes the floor in the deep background.

                LORNE                            ANDY
    Come on Andy...                 The ceilings are beautiful.

                        LORNE (CONT'D)
              Yeah, down there is where Diego
              Rivera was hired to paint a fresco
              dedicated to the American worker.

                        ANDY
              I cannot see it.

                         LORNE
              No on e can. Diego was a commie and
              secretly added Vladimir Lenin in
              the middle of the night. So the
              Rockefellers had it plastered over.

                        ANDY
              That's sad.

    We begin to hear Joe Garagiola announcing the World Series
    over a small radio. Lorne and Andy stop at a trio of
    uniformed guards, huddling around a radio.
                                                                121.

                        SECURITY GUARD
                  (doesn't look up)
              Deliveries use the back.

                                               SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                LORNE
    I'm producing a show here...       Where's your badge?

    Lorne, frustrated, fumbles out an ID BADGE.

                        SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                  (re: Andy)
              Where's his badge?

                        LORNE
              My name is Lorne Michaels. I am the
              producer of Saturday Night.

                        SECURITY GUARD
              The whole night, huh?

            EBERSOL (O.S.)                         LORNE
    Hey, he's good, he's good,         You see, I'm good.
    let him in.

    DICK EBERSOL, a 27 year old NBC junior executive in a Sports
    Coat of checkerboard denim patches, flies in for the rescue.
    He's six foot something and arrived via sports broadcasting.

    He flashes his Saturday Night show badge. The security guard
    unlocks the glass doors with a shrug.

                                                  EBERSOL (CONT'D)
            SECURITY GUARD
    Live on a Saturday night.          Okay, thanks, you're doing a
                                   *
    Must be some show.                 great job.

                        SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
              What kind of name is Saturday Night?

    Lorne pulls Andy in and slides past the guard.

                        LORNE
              Only way NBC remembers when it's on.

    ELEVATOR TO 8TH FLOOR

    Among the many holdovers from broadcasting's ancient history,
    the elevator is manned by an ELEVATOR MAN in livery.

                    ELEVATOR MAN
          Okay folks, put on your seat belts.

Andy looks for seatbelts.

                    EBERSOL
              (to Lorne)
          So... Big night...

                    LORNE
              (to Andy)
          Andy, have you had dinner?

                    ANDY
          Yes, I had spaghetti.

            LORNE                            EBERSOL
Well, that sounds delicious.      Hey, so, I'm getting calls
                                  from upstairs... You ordered
                                  a llama?

                     ANDY
          A llama!

                    LORNE
          Yes, we all decided, it was much
          funnier than a donkey.

                     EBERSOL
          Right, the guys at the loading dock
          just were n't expecting livestock.
                                                                  *

          NBC did ask for something fresh and
          unexpected.

                        EBERSOL
              What kind of show is it? Do you
              even know what the show is?

          Am I still in the show?

CHEVY CHASE (31), gangly and beaming, walks THROUGH a trash
can, spilling garbage across the hallway. He topples
awkwardly then instantly springs up like a gymnast.

                    CHEVY (CONT'D)
          Sorry, tripped over my penis.

His fiancee, JACQUELINE CARLIN, 25, People-magazine-pretty,
tries to keep pace.

          Jackie, my girlfriend.

                     JACQUELINE
          Fiancee.

Jackie waves and Chevy reacts to her engagement ring as
though being blinded, actually walking into a wall.

                    LORNE
          Looks expensive.

                    CHEVY
          She is... It is.

Jacqueline PUNCHES him hard.

                    JACQUELINE
          I never know when you're kidding.

Lorne pulls Chevy in for a moment.

                    LORNE
          Hey, look, can you show a little
          goodwill towards your co-star?

          expectations. Perhaps he's just...

                    CHEVY
          I'll tell you what the issue is.
          We're not doing a radio hour
          anymore and he's built like an
          Albanian cheeseburger.

                    JACQUELINE
          Chevy can't help if people are
          responding to his face.

                    CHEVY
          I mean I could. But, I won't.

                    LORNE
          Right. No one's asking you to deny
          your own magnetism, Chevy.

                     JACQUELINE
          Maybe there's other roles for John
          t o play like a hobo or a troll...

As Chevy continues walking, Lorne approaches the Control
Room. Audrey from behind...

            AUDREY                           LORNE
You need to cut something.       We'll figure it out.

Lorne pulls on the door, but it's locked. Lorne knocks. An
imposing portrait of the fabled conductor Arturo Toscanini
stares him down. Lorne bangs on the door. Neil runs up.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
              (still knocking)
          Get me a key to this door. In fact,
          I want keys to all the doors...

                    NEIL
          ... In the building?

                    LORNE
          If you can.

    Lorne clearly feels like an outsider as he slides between the
    console and monitors... Out of the way... down in front...

    programming and various Commercials:

    Up in the valley of the Jolly Green Giant... Heat the meat
    and gravy from the top can and add the crisp oriental
    vegetables from the bottom can... My old watch always
    stopped. Then I got my Timex Electric.

    Lorne stops at DAVE WILSON (40s), a soft man in a tight
    sweater vest - The director.

                                                 LORNE (CONT'D)
              DAVE WILSON
       (into headset)                Dave, how we looking?
    Hey Stew, line up on camera
    three, will you?

                        DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
              Still working out the forty seven
              notes you gave on your last visit.

              DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)               LORNE
       (into headset)                How's the morale out there?
    Earth to Stew... Focus up
    buddy.

                        DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
              The morale? Oh, I think I can speak
              for the entire crew when I say this
              is exactly how we wanted to spend
              our Saturday evening.

                        LORNE
              Right. Well, keep up the good work.

    Lorne finds a spot in the back row. He picks up a bag of
    chips, opens it, but notably never eats one.

    Lorne checks the WALL CLOCK - 10:14pm.

    Barbara Gallagher, asso ciate producer reads out credits to a
    pony-tailed graphics dude, POOK.

      BARBARA GALLAGHER                      POOK
Okay, next card, Al "Bud"       Is this, like, a bit?
Franken. Next card, Tom "Bud"
Davis...

                    BARBARA GALLAGHER (CONT'D)
          I don't get half the shit they do,
          next card, Rosie "Bud"...
              (quietly to Lorne)
          Is Rosie going with Michaels or
          Shuster?

                    LORNE
          Good question.

                    BARBARA GALLAGHER
          Should I ask Rosie?

                    LORNE
          No, I'll take care of it.

ON MONITOR - We see a clip of the cast on a talk show.

We find a man sport ing a vintage waistcoat and fedora in the
dark, lighting a cigarette on a short stemmed cigarette
holder. MICHAEL O'DONOGHUE, head writer and prince of
darkness. He's staring at a matronly woman in the front row -

JOAN CARBUNKLE (50), NBC Standards. Red lipstick, golden
cross and a pillbox hat. Attacking a script with a RED PEN.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Don't stare, Michael.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          She's been at it for hours.

                                          O'DONOGHUE (CONT'D)
             LORNE
S he's simply doing her job -   I refuse to comply.
we have to comply with NBC
standards.

Carbunkle turns her attention to Mike and Lorne.

                    JOAN
          Mr. O'Donoghue, on page twelve,
          what is "clam diving?"

Lorne stifles a laugh.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I believe, the act of harvesting
          mollusks, right Lorne?
                                                     108.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    LORNE
          Uh huh.

Joan shakes her head and crosses the dialogue out.

                    JOAN
          And, what is... zipper dinner?

Now, the room cracks up.

Joan crosses that out too.

                    LORNE
              (quietly)
          How many of these did you hide in
          the script?

                    O'DONOGHUE
              (quietly)
          Maybe a dozen. It's like a
          scavenger hunt.

                    JOAN
          I know what "blue balls" are.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          You don't say.

                    LORNE
          I'm glad you're having fun, but
          this isn't helpful.

                    O'DONOGHUE
              (quietly t o Lorne)
          If that piglet actually disfigures
          my work, I'm going to turn her
          uterus into a sock puppet.

                    LORNE
          I can't picture that.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I can and I have.

                    LORNE
          Patience. Once we're live, there's
          nothing they can do.

On MONITORS, the "Home Security" sketch lines up.

                    DAVE WILSON
          Rehearsals up. Let's see if we can
          get through one of these skits.
                                                               107.

    Lorne takes a step towards the glass window to 8H.

8                                                                 8
    STAGE FLOOR

    An OLD CHAIN RATCHET is lifting up a LIGHTING BOOM into the
    rafters. It's loaded with lights and the chain is struggling.

    STEW SORRENTINO (55), lighting director, losing his patience.

                        STEW SORRENTINO
              Give me lights 25B, 25D, half down
              on 31. Half Down on 31. That's 32.
                  (notices the boom)
              Jesus, that's a lot of lights on
              the left wing boom. Anyone know the
              load bearing on the booms?

    A LIVING ROOM SET is being painted by hand.

    Sitting on a sofa are GILDA RADNER (29) and a bearded JOHN
    BELUSHI (26).

    A dresser places GLASSES on John's face. He flinches,
    irritated. John is clearly moody. Gilda clocks it.

                        GILDA
              Hey John...

    Gilda quickly makes a face. John raises an eyebrow.

                        GILDA (CONT'D)
                  (yelling whisper)
              John...

    John darts his eyes back and forth.

                        GILDA (CONT'D)
                  (yelling whisper)
              There's something very important I
              need to tell you.

    John satellites his ear in her direction. Gilda moves to the
    coffee table.

                        GILDA (CONT'D)
              I schtooped one of our costars last
              night... one of the muppets.

    Gilda hooks a thumb back at a TABLE OF LIFELESS MUPPETS.
    Crates underneath are stenciled HENSON ASSOCIATES.
                                                              106.
                        2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                        GILDA (CONT'D)
              Don't look... I'm still pulling
              felt out of my teeth.
                  (interestingly...)
              Turns out he just has a big floppy
              hole between his legs. So I stuck
              my hand all the way...

                        JOE DICSO
              Okay, quiet please.

    We hear the raspy boom of the stage manager JOE DICSO.

9                                                                  9
    CONTROL ROOM

    In the room, we see Audrey Dickman click her stopwatch.
    Cameras are cued. Corrections are made in real time.

             DAVE WILSON                          POOK
    Cue... What's his name?          Danny Aykroyd.

                        DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
              Cue Aykroyd... Cue Aykroyd...

    A faint, dull thud can be heard through the speakers.

                        BARBARA GALLAGHER
              He can't get through the door.

    On Monitor - We see someone tr ying to get through the door.

             DAVE WILSON                     LEO YOSHIMURA
    You fucking kiddin me? Put       Eugene found an antique door
    your shoulder into it kid...     in salvage. Sixty pounds of
                                     oak.

    Wham! - DAN AYKROYD (22) muscles through the door and enters.

                                              DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
          BARBARA GHALLAGER
    That's one way to do it.         He's going to tear a muscle.

                        O'DONOGHUE
              He's 22. He'll heal.

                        AYKROYD (ON SCREEN)
                  (mile a minute)
              Hi there! Please don't be alarmed,
              this is only a simulated assault
              and burglary, I repeat, this is a
              simulated assault and burglary.
              This could happen to you at any
              time, in fact it just has.
                                                                105.

     As the actors give it their all, the stage hands talk amongst
     each other, paying little mind to the performers.

                           GILDA
                 Call the police!

                           AYKROYD
                     (removes mask)
                 Don't call the police, I am the
                 police... I might be anyway...

                           DAVE WILSON
                 Ha! This kid ain't half bad.

     We continue to hear camera directions, lighting cues...

                           LORNE
                     (to Neil, taking notes)
                 He's got to hold the gun in his
                 other hand or we don't see it.

     SNAP! - ON MONITOR - A LIGHTING BOOM CRASHES through the
     coffee table. The Actors leap back.

     Everyone in the control room jumps to their feet in panic.
     We're following Lorne as he shoulders his way out and into...

10                                                                10
     STUDIO 8H

     Lorne continues pushing through everybody to set. We hear
     Aykroyd continue, not missing a beat.

                           AYKROYD
                 We also offer sudden catastrophic
                 roof collapse policies. Have your
                 girders been checked?

     The sofa CATCHES FIRE. Joe Dicso is already in there with an
     extinguisher, dousing it. People scatter further.

     LEO YOSHIMURA (20s), art director, surveys the damage.

                           YOSHIMIURA
                 We're going to need another sofa.

                           LORNE
                 Grab one from the 17th. Not from my
                 office.

     TOM SCHILLER, 28, new wave vibe, walks by BURNING SAGE.

                           LORNE (CONT'D)
                 What are you up to, Tom?
                                                        104.

                    TOM SCHILLER
          Burning Sage. Removing demons.

Lorne takes it from him and gives himself a circle of sage.

                    LORNE
          Make sure you hit the control room.

A CHAPMAN CAMERA CRANE drives through, almost nailing crew.

                    JOE DICSO
          Watch it on the Chapman, Al!

                    STEW SORRENTINO
          Could someone please clear the
          children.

                    BELUSHI
          Why? You got any more fucking
          lights to drop on us?

Belushi lunges for Stew, but Aykroyd catches him.

           BELUSHI (CONT'D)                AYKROYD
Fucking amateur hour!           I know. He's not worth it.

                    LORNE
              (turns to Sorrentino)
          How dare you endanger my actors?

                    STEW SORRENTINO
          You're the one who asked for a
          hundred fucking light cues.

                    LORNE
          Feel free to let me know when my
          standards surpass your abilities.

                    GILDA
          I don't know guys, that was kind of
          exciting. It's probably good luck!

Aykroyd has an aside with the aging prop guy, WALLIE.

                    AYKROY D
              (re: handgun prop)
          This thing is ridiculous. It has
          zero stopping power. He'd have
          something with a little more heft.

                    WALLIE
          The script said `pistol'.
                                                        103.

                    AYKROYD
          The script specifically called for
          a Smith and Wesson K-Frame Model 19
          Combat Magnum.

                    WALLIE
          Kid, this ain't an armory. No one's
          going to notice the difference.

                    AYKROYD
          I'll tell you who's gonna notice.
          The fine folks at home who lugged M-
          16's through four feet of swamp
          juice in Quang Nam.

                    WALLIE
          Wow, you really put a lot of
          thought into this.

(Note: One by one, the crew will come to like the SNL cast.
Wallie is the first to come around.)

                    LORNE
          Let's go again.

                    BELUSHI
          In that death trap?

                    GILDA
          I still think it was kind of funny.

Gilda hops into the lap of AL, the Chapman Camera Operator.

                    GILDA (CONT'D)
          How high will this thing go, Al?
          Give me a tour of the city!

                    CHAPMAN CRANE OP
          How `bout a tour of the stage.

            GILDA                            LORNE
Deal!                           Gilda...!

The crane rises into the sky and WE RISE WITH IT. We leave
behind Lorne argu ing with Stew the lighting director.

Moving through 8H like a sky tour. Gilda waves like a float
queen and crew wave back.

                    CHAPMAN CRANE OP
          First stop, home base, you got your
          stage hands...

The stage hands wave up to Gilda.
                                                               102.

     Hey boys!                         The camera boys...
                                       electrics...

     Gilda is loving it, laughing and kicking her legs.

                           GILDA (CONT'D)
                 Guess I chose the wrong day to not
                 wear underwear!

                           CHAPMAN CRANE OP
                 Second stop, the bleachers, under
                 which live the painters, the cable
                 wranglers, the cue card kids...
                 Third stop, the sound boys and boom
                 jockeys... Final stop, the stars.

     We're up in the audience balcony. Gilda hops off.

            CHAPMAN CRANE OP (CONT'D)            GILDA
     Adieu mon cheri.                Merci monsieur.

     Gilda turns and bumps into JANE CURTIN (28), hair in CURLERS,
     giving a tour to her Connecticut blue-blood husband, PATRICK.

                           GILDA (CONT'D)
                 Oh wow, hi Jane. Can you just stand
                 how pretty she is? I just want to
                 polish your earrings.

                 Gilda's in the cast with me.
                     (to Gilda)
                 This is my husband Patrick.

                           GILDA
                     (guffaws)
                 Oh my god, you're married! You're
                 such a grown up. Can I come live
                 with you guys? I'm house trained. I
                 can curl up at the foot of the bed.

     Jane and Patrick laugh awkwardly.

     STUDIO 8H

     We find GARRETT MORRIS (37), in costume from the last sketch,
     carrying a SHOTGUN. He approaches the large tabletop outer-
     space set for the MUPPETS.

     Withou t thinking, Garrett playfully pretends to shoot the
     muppets in the face. BAM, BAM. The gangly sweet faces of JIM
     HENSON (30) and FRANK OZ pop up from behind the set.
                                                        101.
                     2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    HENSON
          Hey! Come on man.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Oh hi Jim, sorry for... shooting
          your muppets.

                    HENSON
          They're not just... Garret, they're
          your co-stars.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Yeah, okay. Are you alright there?

                    HENSON
          Yeah, uh... No. I don't think the
          writing staff here speak muppet.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Have you spoken to Chevy or
          O'Donoghue?

                    HENSON
          Yes, they tied a belt around Big
          Bird's neck and left him hanging
          from my dressing room door...

Henson suddenly quiet as O'Donoghue approaches.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Hey, I heard about Big Bird. I'm so
          sorry. Auto-Erotic Asphyxiation.
          Who knew...?

                     HENSON
          Bologna.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Uh oh. Cursing.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
              (walking away)
          Sorry... I guess.

Garret passes by the STAGE HANDS and CAMERA BOYS. They're
figuring out a scene change. How to move a set into the wings
between the cameras peds in twelve seconds.

Garrett approaches a pianist and his band, waiting in the
wings. It's musical guest BILLY PRESTON (30). They're working
out a musical flourish together.

A stage hand placing audience chairs inches from the band.

                    BASSIST
          Shit, is this a sing-a-long? You
          can't get the audience any closer?

Garrett looking for a way to start a convo with Preston.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Sounding good, guys.

                    BILLY PRESTON
          Yeah, okay...

                    GARRETT MORRIS
              (still on his back foot)
          We actually worked together before.
          I sang back up for Belafonte.

                     BILLY PRESTON
              (to his band mates)
          Catch that? He was a Belafonte
          Singer.
              (singing "Cocoanut Woman")
          Get your c ocoanut water...

                    BAND MATES
          Four to five!

                    BILLY PRESTON
          Man, it's good for you daughter...

                    BAND MATES
          Four to five!

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Coco got a lotta iron...

They all laugh. Hard to tell if they're making fun of him.

                    BILLY PRESTON
          This guy singing too. Man, how many
          folks they have playing tonight?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          No, no... I'm one of the comedic
          performers. I'm in the cast.

                    BILLY PRESTON
              (disbelief)
          You're a comedi an?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Well no, not by trade. I'm actually
          a playwright.

                    GARRETT MORRIS (CONT'D)
          Perhaps you saw my work at the
          Black Arts Repertory Theater in
          Harlem.

                    BILLY PRESTON
          Yeah, I must have missed that.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          I don't actually know why they
          hired me.

                    BILLY PRESTON
          You seem a little nervous.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          I do? I mean, yes (laughs) I am.

                    BILLY PRESTON
              (turns to drummer)
          Alvin, hook Mr... (looks back)
          What's your name?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Garrett Morris...

                    BILLY PRESTON
          Hook Mr. Garret Morris u p with a
          little confidence.

Preston's drummer hands Garrett a SMALL VIAL.

                    DRUMMER
          Medical grade. Shit so light, air
          is at the bottom of the bottle.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Oh... thanks... Great...

Garrett now stumbling away, checking out his gift.

                    STEW SORRENTINO (O.C.)
          Consider me the first rat off the
          ship!

We whip across to see Stew, the lighting director, quitting
and storming off. The stage hands applaud Ste w for leaving.

                    LORNE
          What can I say, bon voyage.

                    EBERSOL
          Lorne, he was our lighting
          director. We need lights.

                    LORNE
          There must be someone in the
          building who can press a button...

                    JOE DICSO
          He's the only one who knows the
          location of the two hundred lights
          you asked for.

Ebersol looks up... That is a lot of lights.

                    LORNE
              (onto something else)
          What's the meaning of this?

On the back of a director's chair - CHILDREN'S TELEVISION
WORKSHOP. Lorne rips it off. It was his chair.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          This isn't helpful.

                     SHOP STEWARD
          I t hought we were making a comedy.

Tight laughter from the old stage hands of 8H. For the first
time, we notice that they're an older generation.

                    JOE DICSO
          Okay, everyone quiet for sound
          check! Sound Check!

This is repeated through the stage as Lorne gets a burst of
energy and runs up into the bleacher seats. He wants the
audience experience as the Preston band takes its marks.

                    EBERSOL
              (tagging along)
          This should be fun.

                    LORNE
          Have you heard Billy Preston live
          before? You know he was the fifth
          Beatle.

                       DRUMMER
          2, 3, 4...

The bands comes to life... They sound fantastic.

Lorne now at the sound board. He tries on a pair of
HEADPHONES. Frowns. In the headphones, it sounds tiny.

                    LORNE
          Is this full volume?
                                                        97.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


SCOTTY, the sound engineer, nods.

                    SCOTTY
          Whole enchilada.

                    EBERSOL
              (always the bright side)
          Sounds pretty adequate.

                    LORNE
          This isn't Wimbledon. It needs to
          feel like a rock concert.

                     EBERSOL
              (smoothing)
          Lorne has such a deep appreciation
          for music.

Lorne eyes the one mic, hanging sadly from above.

                    LORNE
          Shouldn't we have more mics?

                    SCOTTY
          One band. One mic.

                     LORNE
          You always put this much care into
          your work?

                     SCOTTY
          O nly when the honcho is this
          inspiring.

Lorne already walking away... Turns to Ebersol.

                    LORNE
          This needs to be fixed. Tonight.

Below, the FREIGHT ELEVATOR OPENS, revealing a wardrobe rack.
A sign on the front says BELUSHI. A BEE COSTUME at the front.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER (O.C.)
          Wo, wo, wo... This John's?

We turn to find a buoyant young writer with a pencil behind
her ear, ROSIE SHUSTER.

                    WARDROBE ASST
          Yeah, I heard he's in make up.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
          You got a death wish or something?
          Come on, I got it.
                                                               96.

     Rosie grabs the rack and starts driving it herself.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
               Out of my way, everybody... Beep,
               beep... Morty, pick a lane!

     Rosie under the bleachers, navigating the Cue Card Kids
     working furiously, the painters listening to the world
     series, the cable guys playing cards.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
               Nice hand, Jimmy.

     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     The wardrobe cart slaloms around an old STAGE HAND eating
     MACARON I AND GRAVY.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER
               Easy on the Macaroni, Carmine.

     We turn into the...

     DRESSING ROOM

     Rosie pulls the rack to a hard stop. We find Belushi sitting
     on a folding chair, changing out of his clothes from "Home
     Security". He clocks the bee costume and rolls his eyes.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER
               There he is. Star of the show.

                         BELUSHI
               Come on Rosie, not the fucking
               bees.

     An asst costumer goes to place ANTENNI on John's head, but he
     flinches away. Rosie pulls out a CIGARETTE PACK and shakes
     out a couple for John. He reluctantly takes them as the
     slinky antenna are slid over his unkempt dome.

                         BELUSHI (CONT'D)
               I'm not a dashboard ornament.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER
               You're adorable is what you are.
               Every girl's going to want to
               squeeze you.

     A naughty look crosses John's face. He buzzes like a bee.
                                                             95.

                         ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
               Watch where you point that stinger.

                         BELUSHI
                   (super serious while
                    bouncing his antenna)
               I am a trained professional.

     Rosie breaks up laughing at Belushi.

     LARAINE NEWMAN (23) wanders in to see a rack of costumes.

                         LARAINE
               What happened to my reporter
               costume? Blaine Hotel?

                         WARDROBE ASST
               It's a five second change over from
               the reporter to ancient Greece.
               Lorne didn't think you'd have time
               to get into your toga.

                         LARAINE
               Oh, okay...

     Laraine sighs and steps back out into...

     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Deep background, Jackie Carlin is going over the run of show
     board with Audrey Dickman, angling for a scene.

     Franken and Davis are also present, unpackaging a box with a
     lot of tubes. A delivery with a heavy box arrives for them.

     Laraine is basically JUMPED by Aykroyd. He picks her up and
     twirls he r back to the ground.

                          LARAINE

                          AYKROYD

     An EDITOR crosses frame.

     The editor pops his head in to find Rosie.

                           EDITOR
                Hey Rosie, got the latest cut on
                "New Dad".

     Rosie kisses Belushi on the forehead.

                          ROSIE SHUSTER
                Behave. (winks) Bee-have.

     Rosie runs out into the...

     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Rosie passe s Danny talking to Laraine and slaps his ass.

                           ROSIE SHUSTER
                They need you in costumes. I told
                them to make those hot pants...
                extra hot.

     Before Danny can protest, Rosie is calling down the hallway.

                          ROSIE
                    (to Lorne)
                Hey, we're going to check the cut
                on "New Dad". Wanna see?

     As Lorne approaches, directly in front of him - THUD!! - The
     clothing rack with the bee costume is kicked into the
     hallway. Explodi ng against the wall.

                          LORNE
                You know he hates the bee costume.

                    ROSIE
          This isn't a costume problem. He
          thinks he's Brando.

He'll be studied.                They'll study his liver.

Lorne smiles. Schiller walks by with the Sage.

              LORNE (CONT'D)                          (CONT'D)
                                              ROSIE
Thanks Tom.                     Thanks Tom.

                    ROSIE (CONT'D)
          John's better when he's angry.

made a covenant with the
Natio nal Broadcast Company.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          I'm on the hook for ninety minutes
          of live television.

A beat.

                    ROSIE
          No one said it needs to be good.

                    LORNE
          Must you turn him into a bee?

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
              (entering the edit bay)
          I'm not `turning him into a bee'.
          He's a man in a bee costume.
          There's a difference. It's the kind
          of image you can't get out of your
          head. It's post-modern. It's
          Warhol. It's iconic.

                    LORNE
          Where the heck do these ideas come
          from?

She points to her temple.
                                                                92.

     EDIT BAY

     Lorne and Rosie now standing behind the editor. A pre-taped
     parody commercial plays on the MONITOR - Aykroyd enters a
     suburban home and hugs Jackie (Chevy's fiancee).

             ROSIE SHUSTER                        EDITOR
     Tighten the top as he enters.    Tightening the top.

                          LORNE
                Whoops. Looks like Chevy's fiancee
                slipped and fell into another
                segment.

                           ROSIE SHUSTER
                Jacq ueline's going to be hosting
                the show if you're not careful.

     On the monitor, a LARGE "X" strikes out Danny's face.

                          LORNE
                Can we add sound there over the X?

                 EDITOR                       ROSIE SHUSTER
     Like a buzzer?                   No, funny, like a bell.

                goin g home with him tonight?

     No, I just didn't know... I      It's opening night. I didn't

            LORNE (CONT'D)               ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
I mean, neither did I...         Then why are you asking?

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Just avoiding surprises, Roz.

                                             LORNE (CONT'D)
        ROSIE SHUSTER
You love surprises.              I love surprises.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
          Like Anne Frank loved her drum
          sticks.

The editor laughs at Rosie's joke.

                    LORNE
          Don't encourage her.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
              (to editor)
          Hold on the photo another eight
          frames.

            LORNE                            ROSIE
Sixteen frames.                  I think eight.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Oh, Barbara was asking about your
          credit. Figured you'd go with
          Michaels.

The editor pops their head up for a moment.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
          Is that what you want?

                    LORNE
          We're married. You're my wife. It's
          the straightest line.

                     ROSIE SHUSTER
          Lorne. We're married, but I'm not
          your wife.

                    LORNE
          I don't think that'll fit on the
          crawl.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
          What would you prefer?

BARBARA GALLAGHER enters frantically.
                                                                 90.

                         BARBARA
               Lorne! NBC execs are in the green
               room, waiting for you!

                  LORNE                           EDITOR
        (already off)                 VTR needed this yesterday!
     Fuck.
        (to Editor)
     This is really close.

18                                                                 18
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Lorne goes for the stairwell door, but stops at the sight of
     Belushi in his antenni, entranced by a TV playing an NBC
     SHOWREEL. John looks like he might vomit.

                         LORNE
               Young man, I need you to sign your
               contract or they w on't let you go
               in front of the cameras.

     Belushi just buzzes back like a bee.

     Lorne turns and stops. The show's youngest writers, TOM DAVIS
     and AL FRANKEN are prepping some sort of pump.

                         LORNE (CONT'D)
               Tom? Al? What's this all about?

               AL FRANKEN                       TOM DAVIS
     A last minute piece.             Just in case you need it.

                         LORNE
               I don't. What's the gag?

               AL FRANKEN                       TOM DAVIS
     We're going to dress Aykroyd     America's favorite chef.
                                  *
     up as Julia Childs.

                            LORNE
               Okay...

               TOM DAVIS                        AL FRANKEN
     And right as she's carving up    She slices opens an artery.
     a turkey on live television,

               AL FRANKEN (CONT'D)              TOM DAVIS (CONT'D)
     Blood. Everywhere.               Everywhere.

     A quiet beat.

                         LORNE
               Oh, got it. That's the whole pitch.
                                                              89.

               TOM DAVIS                        AL FRANKEN
     Yeah, just America's favorite    Total gore fest.
     chef painting the walls with
     her insides.

                           AYKROYD
                 Oh, yeah, it's going to be pure
                 carnage.
                     (as Julia)
                 Oh no... I've cut the dickens out
                 of my finger... Oh God it's
                 throbbing...

                           LORNE
                     (walking away)
                 Sounds promising. Put down a tarp.

     Lorne keeps moving. Sees the dressing room marked "George
     Carlin". He goes to enter when he hears the unmistakable
     sound of snorting coke followed by the DOOR SLAMMING. Nods.

     Heads into a door, held open by Ebersol.

19                                                              19
     STAIRWELL

     They double up the stairs. Staff SMOKE CIGARETTES. Lorne and
     Ebersol must worm around it.

                EBERSOL                           LORNE
     How's Carlin?                    Warming up the pipes.

                           EBERSOL (CONT'D)
                 I heard Belushi hasn't signed his
                 contract yet?

                            LORNE
                 That's strange. I'm quite certain
                 he did. (waves his hand) A
                 formality.

                           EBERSOL
                     (laughs awkwardly)
                 Yeah, they're pretty formal here.
                 Speaking of, the folks in standards
                 are a little uneasy about a parody
                 commercial playing right after the
                 regular ads. They think viewers
                 might be confused.

                            LORNE
                 Yeah, one might argue that's what
                 ma kes it humorous.
                                                              88.

                         EBERSOL
               I don't know, Lorne. Are we just
               making fun of the audience for not
               knowing any better?

                          LORNE
                    (pivots)
               Hardly. It's Comedia Del Arte. We
               are engaging in a bit of theater.
               If anything, we will make the other
               commercials feel all the more real.
               The sponsors will probably thank
               you.

                          EBERSOL
               Oh.

     9TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

     Speed walking to the Green Room.

                          LORNE
               So, who's in here? Should I be
               concerned?

                         EBERSOL
               No... Just... You know, try not to
               use words like underground or
               revolutionary.

                         LORNE
               I'm not exactly Che Guevara.

     They pass a door with a hand written sign - The Departure
     Lounge - Music pours out. They keep walking.

                         EBERSOL
               I know but sometimes, you get a
               little... I don't know. Look, this
               is TV. It's in your living room.
               It's supposed to relax you.

                         LORNE
               How positively scintillating.

     Lorne opens the do or to the green room and hits a wall of
     FIFTY DRUNK MIDDLE AGED MEN IN SUITS WITH COCKTAILS.

     Lorne flinches back and pulls the door shut.
                                                                87.

                 LORNE (CONT'D)                   EBERSOL
     What the hell? There's like a     Fifty. The affiliates. From
     thousand people in there!         across the country. They're
                                       excited to see the show.

                            LORNE (CONT'D)
                  I don't have time for glad handing!

                            EBERSOL
                  Lorne. These are the people that
                  will decide whether or not we have
                  a hit. They choose what goes on
                  air. We need them.

     Lorne steels himself.

     GREEN ROOM

     Lorne reenters the room with a big smile. Starts shaking
     every mitt that's presented his way. The crowd is decidedly
     midwestern and sprinkled with attractive NBC PAGES.

     We push through the suits to find one man turned away from
     the crowd. For the moment, he's more interested in the drink
     he's pouring. We only clock his hands an d his SIGNET RINGS.

     Above the crowd we see CHEVY and O'DONOGHUE on a small stage.
     Chevy holding a FULL GLASS OF WATER.

                            CHEVY
                  Ladies and gentlemen, who am I
                  kidding, gentlemen, I've always
                  liked to say that...

     Chevy motions casually with his hand, tossing the water from
     his glass across the room. HUGE LAUGH.

                            CHEVY (CONT'D)
                  Oh, I'm sorry...

     Chevy steps towards one of the affiliates and uses their tie
     to mop his own brow.

                            CHEVY (CONT'D)
                  Much better.

     He steps back, fumbling along the way, perhaps knocking
     something over.

                    CHEVY
          Let me introduce you to our head
          writer, the prince of darkness...
          My husband... My lover... Michael
          O'Donoghue. I hear you have a
          little impression for us.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Thank you Chevy.
              (to room)
          I'm certain you all know Mr.
          Rogers, perhaps the most kind and
          gentle man on television. This is
          my impression of Mr. Rogers
          plunging eighteen inch steel sewing
          needles into his eyes.

WHAM! - O'Donoghue sl ams his empty fists against his face and
falls to the ground in agonizing screams.

A beat. Then THUNDEROUS applause and laughter.

Chevy pulls Lorne up on stage.

                    LORNE
              (taking the mic)
          Hi, uh, well, now you see why they
          put us on at midnight.

The room grows quiet.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          We have a great show for you
          tonight... George Carlin... the
          great Billy Preston. Next week, my
          good friend Paul Simon hosting...
          Look, there has never been a show
          made for and by the generation that

     Lorne enters the hive of activity with Ebersol, Chevy, and

Chevy stops at HERB SARGENT's desk. At 50, he is the elder

          Well, I don't know Chevy. I've

          just made a fortune, won a few
          Emmys, and slept with Gloria

          you'll self-medicate with hookers

We pan to find Gilda and Laraine picking away at th eir

replace the burned furniture from earlier.

Gilda and Laraine turn to find interns laying out SCRIPTS
down the length of the corridor in a collating effort. A
train of paper that goes on forever.

          We can't afford the postage.

          Lorne's got a way of seeing

          where their talent fits. There's a
          reason you're here. You may not
          know it, but Lorne does.

Laraine moves along the pages, compiling a script as she
goes. Something in one of the scenes makes her chuckle. She's
aligning the pages, when she hears familiar dialogue...

                    AYKROYD (O.C.)
          Ma'am, you're dealing here with a

Laraine turns to find Aykroyd with Gilda up in his arms.

                    GILDA
          Hey, I'm not a prop, mister.

Laraine can't hide her reaction and Gilda sees it. They lock
eyes and mutually understand what's happening.

                    AYKROYD
          I can assure you professional
          hygiene, discretion...

Gilda slides to the ground. Laraine pretends to laugh along,
but it's paper thin. Danny turns and catches Laraine's look.
An uncomfortable pause. Before anything can be said...

Tom Schiller crosses frame, carrying the SAGE and we follow
him into Lorne's office. Desk, chair, and a sofa. Rosie
sitting on a filing cabinet. O'Donoghue on the floor.

                    O'DONOGHUE
              (re: the sage)
          Get that hippie shit out of her e.

Schiller exits quickly as Lorne leans into the doorway.

                    LORNE
          Hey, I need the Muppet pages.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I already turned in that one
          script.

                    ROSIE
          Was Jim Henson uncomfortable with
          Muppets on a plantation?

                    O'DONOGHUE
          It was a musical number.

                    LORNE
          I don't think that was the problem.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I just can't write for those little
          hairy facecloths.

                    LORNE
          I need something for Henson. We go
          live in an hour.

                    ROSIE
          What if you sent him a little felt
          toe in a newspaper?

Before Lorne can respond, Anne pushes through and hands
O'Donoghue a script covered in red ink.

                    ANNE
          Did you see what that evangelical
          cunt did to our pages?

We follow Lorne's look back to find Franken and Davis

          Sexy and horny just don't mean the
          same thing.

                    CARBUNKLE
          I struggle to see the difference.

                    AL FRANKEN
          Well, if a dog is humping your leg,
          it's horny.

                    TOM DAVIS
          It is certainly not sexy.

That's when we notice O'Donoghue LIGHTING HIS PAGES ON FIRE.

                    CARBUNKLE
          What on Earth are you doing?

People watch as O'Donoghue walks to the window and tosses the
flaming script out the window to the street below.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I'd rather buttfuck cancer than
          make these changes.

The office goes quiet. Tension mounts.

                    CARBUNKLE
          Your words don't scare me Mr.
          O'Donoghue. I'm a woman of God.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I've heard God's love is blind. Now
          I know why.

Carbunkle presents her RED PEN.

                    CARBUNKLE
          You see this? I know it looks like
          an ordinary red marker, but this
          one is special. It has kept America
          safe for the better part of a
          decade. It is a weapon against
          vulgarity, sex, communism, and
          heathenism.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          What about violence? Does it
          protect America from violence?

                    CARBUNKLE
          Yes, that too.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          How `bout infanticide?

                       CARBUNKLE
          Excuse me?

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Apologies. Just a two dollar word
          for a parent who kills their own
          child.

                    CARBUNKLE
          The mere thought makes me nauseous.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Understandably - Me too, by the way
          - It's just, I had this idea for a
          sketch... I'm not sure if it's
          funny, you can be th e judge. It's
          about this powerful temperamental
          guy who rapes this virgin in the
          middle of the night - I know, awful
          - He knocks her up without ever
          saying hello, buying her flowers,
          whatever... And then, and then,
          here's the funny part, he has their
          bastard son publicly mutilated and
          tortured to death on a cross.
              (a beat)
          Wait, you've heard this one before.

                    CARBUNKLE
          You're a vile human.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I know. We both are. I'm just more
          entertaining.

Carbunkle pulls off her pill box hat and goes to leave.

                    HERB
          No, it was funnier with the hat.

                    CARBUNKLE
              (turns back)
          Mr. O'Donoghue...

                         O'DONOGHUE
               Are we still being formal? Please,
               just call me Satan.

                         CARBUNKLE
               You will be forgotten... I'm going
               to make sure of it.

     And with that, she storms out.

                         LORNE
               Are you out of your mind?!

                         O'DONOGHUE
               Look for better or worse, I call it
               as I see it.

                         LORNE
               That was worse.

     Meanwhile, Barbara runs up to Lorne.

                         BARBARA
               They need you at the loading dock!

                          LORNE
               Surely someone else can sign for
               whatever...
                   (to O 'Donoghue)
               You're back on Muppets.

                         O'DONOGHUE
               Fuck you! I'll quit.

                         LORNE
               No, you won't.

                         BARBARA
               It's Leo. He's fighting with
               security. There's blood.

     FREIGHT ELEVATOR

     Lorne enters and Neil hands him a sandwich. He will notably
     never get to take a bite. Before the elevator doors can
     close, Ebersol hops on with a smile.

                         EBERSOL
               Hey, while I've got you... I know
               you always want to be on the
               cutting edge, w ell check this out--

                We can have the actors demo the
                camera live. Maybe write it into
                sketches, do live commercials.
                Funny ones! The payout is bonkers!

                          LORNE
                The cast didn't sign up to do live
                commercials. Frankly, neither did
                I. Some of the cast might find
                it... unseemly.

                          EBERSOL
                Television's driven by advertising.
                That's what makes the motor run.

                          LORNE
                Just don't show this to the talent.
                We don't want them thinking they're
                back on the Kraft Macaroni Hour.

                          EBERSOL
                We're over budget.

                          LORNE
                You don't need to tell me that.

                          EBERSOL
                Somebody needs to tell you that.

                          LORNE
                We don't even know what the show IS
                exactly yet. How could we possibly
                know the budget?

                          EBERSOL
                If you don't know what the show is,
                what the fuck are we doing here?

                          LORNE
                I know the ingredients. Just not
                the amounts.

     Elevator DINGS.

                          LORNE (CONT'D)
                We just need to get to 11:30...

     Lorne drops his uneaten sandwich and runs out onto the...

     DRIVEWAY

     Lorne, Ebersol, Barbara, and Neil emerge quickly. We whip
                                                              73.

     around just as Leo Yoshimura takes a punch to the face from a
     meathead SECURITY GUARD (45). His glasses are broken (they
     will be taped-up for the rest of the film).

                         LEO
               Fuck you, fascist!
                   (steadying himself)
               .... fucking pig.

     Lorne gets in the face of the security guard.

                         LORNE
               You want to lose your job?

                         SECURITY GUARD
               You want to lose your teeth?

                         LORNE
               I'm the producer of NBC'S Saturday
               Night and you just hi t a man with a
               Tony...

                         SECURITY GUARD
               I've punched plenty of Tonys.

     Ebersol has had enough, and he's bigger then all of them.

                         EBERSOL
                   (separating them)
               Goddamn it... We're done, alright?
               I'm your fucking boss, idiot.

     Ebersol gives the guy his card. The guard cools slightly.

                          SECURITY GUARD
               Tell your friends - No deliveries
               after 6PM.

     He points to a sign -- NO DELIVERIES AFTER 6PM.

     Ebersol examines the deliv ery as it's carted to the elevator.
     A large pallet of bricks. He picks one up. It's heavy.
     Ebersol clearly confused by the delivery of actual bricks.

     FREIGHT ELEVATOR


     The elevator is GROANING. It can barely carry the weight of
     the bricks.

          Why do we need real bricks? Can't
          we just roll out linoleum?

                                            EBERSOL (CONT'D)

Hey, FUCK YOU.

          The vision for home base is a
          street corner with all the grit and
          texture of New York City.

                     EBERSOL
          You going to use real blood and
          vomit too?

                    LEO
              (wiping his bloody nose)
          I'll give you fucking blood.

DING! - The elevator stops.

                    LORNE
          Why are we stopping...?

Ebersol opens the VERTICAL DOOR to reveal a A DARK FLOOR and
a lone figure standing there with a record player. Andy.

                    ANDY
          Hello, Mr. Michaels.

                                               ANDY (CONT'D)

Lorne...

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Brick is honest. Workmanlike. It
          has its pockets out. It's critical
          to the success of this show.

exactly?

into focus, when... DING! The Elevator reopens back in 8H.

                 I tell you what I do know. New York

     Lorne takes the opportunity to walk Andy away. Meanwhile,

     CAMERA floats up above the stage floor up to the bleachers.

     We find Garrett Morris and JANE CURTIN (30) watching the
     chaos below. The bricks are wheeled by.

                           GARRETT
                 You nervous?

                 Yeah... I have a pretty good idea.

          Well Garrett, I like to give 100%
          to everything I do...
              (now in commercial voice)
          ...And I want a dish soap that does
          too... So alive, so young,
              (shifting moods)
          so alluring, so exotic, so
          hypnotic, so manipulative, so
          sadistically abusive, so
          cartoonishly abhorrent...

Garrett is not quite sure what's happening here.

              (sudden sunny shift)
          When it comes to my skin and my
          sensitive parts, I only trust 100%

          enough for a man, but whimsical and
          helpless enough for a woman. So
          before you invest in one of those
          high priced other labels, bend over
          and experience a Philadelphia blast

          Don't wait - Act now. Act like your
          very life depends on it. Act like

          Act like the children in Africa
          depend on it.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          What the fuck was all that?

                    JANE

          That was my twenties Garrett. And
          that's what I'm doing here.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Shit, I'm just here to play th e
          butler, the shoe shine guy, and the
          pimp.

                    JANE
          You seem a little nice for a pimp.

          You're a little pretty for a
          comedian.

          spotlight.

A SPOTLIGHT HITS Jane and Garrett, but immediately abandons
them and floats up to the top of the bleachers. From the
stage's feeble speakers, we can just hear DON PARDO, the
show's baritone announcer -

                    DON PARDO (O.S.)
          Your host, George Carlin!

PAUL SHAFFER noodles out a riff on the piano. Comedian GEORGE
CARLIN (40), amped, walks by Garrett and Jane toward s HOME
BASE. He makes his way down a finicky staircase.

                    CARLIN
          I can't just come out from behind a
          god damn curtain? I've got to
          descend like fucking Norma Desmond.
              (to the audience)
          And fuck you... and fuck you... and
          fuck you...
              (to the stage hands)
          And fuck you...

The stage hands love it. They give him a good Fuck You back.
Carbunkle, the NBC censor is on the floor, twitching her
nose. Lorne leans ov er to Neil and motions towards Carbunkle.

            LORNE                              NEIL
Try to distract her.            How?

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          With your sparkling wit.

Neil nods. We follow him as he sidles up to Carbunkle. He
pulls out a DECK OF CARDS and begins a magic trick.

                    NEIL
          Ma'am? Would you agree this is a
          normal deck of cards? No marks, no
          folds, or blemishes?

Carbunkle barely acknowledges Neil. She is focusing her
energy on George Carlin, who passes S HAFFER on the piano and
continues to home base.

                    CARLIN
          Welcome to the show, blah-de-blah,
          going to be some music, some
          laughs, plug the record...
                                                         68.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)                 .


Neil continues with his card trick. Buzzing in Carbunkle's
ear like a persistent fly.

                     CARLIN (CONT'D)
               (begins a bit)
          You ever look at the crowds in old
          movies and wonder if they're dead
          yet?

Some laughs from the stage hands.

                    CARLIN (CONT'D)
          Does that make you uncomfortable?
          It shouldn't. Why is death so
          unsettling? What's going to happen
          tonight? I'm either going to kill
          up here or die...

CRASH! - A pile of BRICKS is du mped at Carlin's feet. Brick
dust plumes as Carlin flinches back.

                    CARLIN (CONT'D)
          Christ! Are you serious with this
          shit?

                    JOE DICSO
          And throw to Janis...

                    CARLIN
              (looks into our camera)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Janis Ian.

CAMERA PANS to find JANIS IAN with an acoustic guitar. She
begins to play her hit single At Seventeen. Quiet, plaintive.

                     JANIS IAN
          I LEARNED THE TRUTH AT SEVENTEEN,
          THAT LOVE WAS MEANT FOR BEAUTY
          QUEE NS...

Carlin hops down as Carbunkle approaches home base.

                    CARBUNKLE
          Mr. Carlin, I am Joan Carbunkle,
          NBC standards...

                    CARLIN
          I didn't know they had any...

                    JANIS IAN
          THE VALENTINES I NEVER KNEW, THE
          FRIDAY NIGHT CHARADES OF YOUTH,
          WERE SPENT ON ONE MORE BEAUTIFUL,
          AT SEVENTEEN I LEARNED THE TRUTH.

Lorne quickly interjects.

                    LORNE
          He's busy, Joan. Why don't you
          share your concerns with me?

                    CARLIN
          No, I'd like to hear her concerns
          personally, if you don't mind.

                    CARBUNKLE
          Mr. Carlin, I know you have a
          propensity for the obscene and a
          lurid interest in colorful
          language. You'll be happy to know
          there is one delay button and my
          finger is on it.

                    CARLIN
          I'd never have guessed you'd found
          the button, let al one touched it.

                    JANIS IAN
          WHO CALLED TO SAY, "COME DANCE WITH
          ME", AND MURMURED VAGUE
          OBSCENITIES, IT ISN'T ALL IT SEEMS,
          AT SEVENTEEN.

Carlin already walking away. Neil jumps in!

                    NEIL
              (holding up a card)
          Is this your eight of diamonds --

He tries to slip a card like a smooth operator but fumbles.
THE DECK SCATTERS TO THE FLOOR.

Oblivious to the stand-off, Leo the art director hops down
and begins laying bricks with a trowel. He looks up at a SHOP
STEWARD with a handful of STAGE HANDS sitting nearby.

                    LEO
          Are you gonna help?

                     SHOP STEWARD
          Yeah, we don't do bricks.
               (to his mates)
          Which guild does the bricks? Is it
          422?

        STAGE HAND ONE                    STAGE HAND TWO
Nah, that's carpenters. How       Nah, that's the pipefitters.
                              *
about 303?
                                                              66.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     The stage hands chuckle but don't move a muscle. Leo fumes.

                         SHOP STEWARD
               Don't know why you're laying brick.
               You're going to be gone in 2 weeks.

                         JANIS IAN
               A BROWN EYED GIRL IN HAND-ME-DOWNS,
               WHOSE NAME I NEVER COULD PRONOUNCE,
               SAID, "PITY, PLEASE, THE ONES WHO
               SERVE, THEY ONLY GET WHAT THEY
               DESERVE."

29                                                              29
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Carlin walks by Billy Crystal, who is holding a large bowl of
     potato chip s. Carlin grabs a chip.

                         BILLY CRYSTAL
               Hey! That's a prop.

     Carlin turns and bows mid-stride. Billy flashes him a smile.
     Valri watches, sitting on the discarded BURNED SOFA.

     (Note: the hallway is decidedly less chaotic for this
     sequence. The quiet before the storm.)

                         BILLY CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                   (to Valri)
               It's like one of those 1950's
               Safari Flicks. The ones that
               starred Rhonda Fleming and Susan
               Hayward... Every time I take a step
               you put your hands in the bowl and
               crunch the potato chips. Try it...

     Billy mimes taking steps through tall grass. With every step,
     Valri crunches her hands in the chips. The effect is
     remarkably convincing. Valri adds bird calls. Billy adjusts
     his pretend safari helmet and aims his pretend safari rifle.
     In his sights....

     Lorne at the Run of Show Board. He unpins a couple cards and
     swap s them. Can't make heads or tails out of it. Walks away.

                         BILLY CRYSTAL (CONT'D)
                   (breaks character)
               There's no way they can fit all
               this show. Something's got to go.

                            VALRI
               You think?
                                                               65.
                                                               6
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                         BILLY CRYSTAL
                   (calls over)
               Hey Lorne - Can we talk minutes?

                         LORNE
                   (barely looks over)
               Doing great, Billy.

     Lorne disappears around a corner. A BEAT.

                 VALRI                         BILLY CRYSTAL
     That was weird.                   Yep, we're fucked.

     Garrett Morris turns on Main Street. As he passes the
     costumes room, we see Laraine working on some sort of QUICK
     CHANGE with the wardrobe assistants. It's not going well.

     We continue with Garret, up to Be lushi who begins to sniff
     him like a hound... like a police dog... He somehow just
     knows that Garrett is copping drugs.

     Belushi now seriously sniffing, making Garrett blush. John
     pats him down and comes up quickly with the vial of cocaine.

                         BELUSHI
               What do we have here?

                         GARRETT MORRIS
               Billy Preston's band hooked me up.
               It's medical grade. Floats in the
               bottle. Then you float.

     Belushi pops the top and hoo vers the entire vial up in one
     snort. He hands the empty vial back to Garrett.

                         BELUSHI
               Yep, checks out, medical grade.

     Garrett is stunned. Belushi walks off.

30                                                                 30
     HAIR/MAKE-UP ROOM

     Belushi enters to find Chevy doing an audio interview with a
     young reporter holding a wired microphone. Jackie looks for a
     way into the interview herself. Jane and Laraine are in black
     leotards and BEE HEADPIECES.
                                                        64.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                     CHEVY
          We have many talented improvisors
          from Toronto and Chicago and I'm
          sure they'll find their way on to
          the program, but yes, I think
          you'll be seeing me fairly
          regularly.

Belushi watches him with contempt, SNORTS derisively.
Starting to feel the coke. Chevy looks over, notices a bit of
powder on Belushi's nose.

                    CHEVY (CONT'D)
          You missed a little there.

Belushi nonchalantly works the residue into his nose as a
make-up gal approaches him with a shaving razor and foam.

Lorne enters, holding Belushi's contract.

                    LORNE
          While I've got you captive.

                    BELUSHI
          They want to neuter my chin.

                    LORNE
          You are getting a little wooly.

                    CHEVY
          Be careful, there's no jaw under
          that beard. Just 10 pounds of neck.

Belushi HURLS an NBC ashtray at Chevy's face. It hits our
camera instead, BREAKING THE LENS.

Belushi lunges for Chevy. BOTTLES and BRUSHES go flying. It's
a quick melee in a small room. Gilda and Laraine react with
genuine concern. Hair and Make-up artists look for cover.

Janis Ian playing ironically against the violence.

Rosie escorts the reporter out as Lorne wedges his way in
between the yet-to-be-comedy-giants.

                    LORNE
              (dad)
          For God's sakes. Chevy - Out. Out!

Che vy leaves in a huff.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          We're throwing things now?

                    BELUSHI
          He started it!

Rosie drops into Belushi's lap.

                    ROSIE
          It's just a shave, John.

                    BELUSHI
          So NBC owns my fucking face?

                    ROSIE
          Would Jimi Hendrix play in mittens?

                    LORNE
          It's a valid point, John. You will
          go down as one of the giants of
          character expressionism of the
          twentieth century. Chaplin. Brando.
          Why hide your gifts?

                    ROSIE
          ... Beards are for pussies.

John considers this. Nods to the woman with the raz or. She
gets to work tying a cloth around his neck, prepping foam.

                    BELUSHI
              (snorts)
          And the bees are bullshit. I didn't
          sign up for that theme park shit.

                    LORNE
          You think I don't know that? Of
          course they are. The bees are
          ridiculous. They're stupid. They're
          post-modern. They're Warhol. Sgt.
          Pepper They're a commentary. I'm
          glad you get it.

Rosie smiles, watching Lorne use her language. They make eye
co ntact. Lorne slides John's deal memo over.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          We go live in less than an hour. I
          need you to sign.

John is considering when Lorne notices something.

                    ROSIE
          What? What happened?

Lorne looks around... The music has stopped.
                                                              62.

                 What happened to the music?

     Lorne grabs the unsigned contract, but leaves his pen on the
     counter. He swiftly exits and we follow --

31                                                              31

                 Was I playing too loud?

                 Yes, that's 50th street between 5th
                 and 6th.
                     (to Lorne)
                 I'm on with the outfit that
                 supplied speakers for Wakeman at

                 Yes, Rockefeller Plaza. Do I sound

                     (to Disco)
                 What can we be doing?

                           JOE DICSO
                 No lights. No sound. We go live in
                 45. What do you want to rehearse?

     Full stop. For the first time, nothing is happening.

                    LORNE
          Pull up Weekend Update.

Commotion again - Cables are lifted as sets move and the
Weekend Update flat is swiftly rolled out in front of home
bass, where Leo is slowly LAYING BRICKS WITH A TROWEL.
Costumers slide a jacket onto Lorne. He sits behind the desk
and swallows before staring into the dark abyss of the lens.

We hear Audrey click her stopwatch.

                    DON PARDO
          From Saturday Night news
          headquarter s, this is Weekend
          Update with Lorne Michaels.

                    LORNE
              (nervous)
          Our top story tonight, some world
          news: Japan Emperor Hirohito met
          Mickey Mouse at Disneyland this
          week. The Emperor presented Mickey
          with a Hirohito wristwatch.

Tepid laughter. Herb Sargent and O'Donoghue concerned.

            LORNE (CONT'D)                  O'DONOGHUE
How was that...?                Horrible.

Lorne nervously looks to his side to find Belushi, now
shaven, wearing a suit jacket over his bee costume.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          And now with a w eather report, we
          turn it over to meteorologist John
          Belushi. What's it looking like out
          there John?

                     BELUSHI
          Thank you Lorne. It's often said
          that March comes in like a lion,
          and goes out like a lamb. At least
          that's how March works here in the
          United States.
              (beat)
          But did you know that March behaves
          differently in other countries? In
          Norway, for example, March comes in
          like a polar bear and goes out like
          a walrus.
                                                                 60.

      CONTROL ROOM

      Dave Wilson and team watching Belushi on MONITOR.

                            BELUSHI
                  Or, take the case of Honduras...

                            DAVE WILSON
                  Where'd they find this guy? A
                  butcher shop?

                            BARBARA GALLAGHER
                  I've got a mechanic that could be
                  his brother.

32B                                                               32B
      STUDIO 8H

      Lorne and crew watch as Belushi builds with steam. A camera
      guy zooms in.

                            BELUSHI
                  ... And there's a country where
                  March hops in like a kangaroo, and
                  stays a kangaroo for a while, and
                  then it becomes a slightly smaller
                  kangaroo. Then, for a couple of
                  days it's sort of a cross between a
                  frilled lizard and a common house
                  cat...

      Lorne now inching away from Belushi - The volcano on the
      verge of eruption.

      The crew meanwhile is transfixed.

                            BELUSHI (CONT'D)
                  Now, now, and it's not Australia!
                  You'd think it would be Australia,
                  but it's not!

      A couple of the stage hands even laughing now a nd murmurring
      to each other.

                            BELUSHI (CONT'D)
                      (spinning out)
                  And there are nine different
                  countries, where March comes in
                  like a frog, and goes out like a
                  golden retriever. But that- that's
                  not the weird part! No, no, the
                  weird part is, is the frog. The
                  frog- The weird part is...
                                                                59.
                          2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     Belushi works himself into an intense physical convulsion.

     For a moment, the crew shows concern, completely entranced by
     Belushi's performance. He performs a coronary over the desk,
     splaying out onto the floor.

     And then, wild laughter gives way to the chatter of awe.

     Lorne jumps down to help John off the floor.

                           LORNE
                 I surrender. You're a genius. Now I
                 need you to sign your contract.

     Belushi grunts.

                           L ORNE (CONT'D)
                 I think that's a yes.

     Lorne places the contract on the Update desk.

                           LORNE (CONT'D)
                 Neil! I need a pen!

     Whip to Neil, who is mid-card trick. His cards go sputtering.
     Meanwhile, Barbara runs up, breathless.

                           BARBARA
                 Lorne, there's a call from Burbank
                 waiting in your office...

                            LORNE
                 It's Carson . Okay, I'll be right
                 back. Get Belushi a pen.
                     (then)
                 Don't let him use it as a straw.

     Lorne exits swiftly. Running u pstairs.

                           LORNE (CONT'D)
                 Rehearse something... Anything!

                           JOE DICSO
                 Bee Hospital to stage left.

     We see BEE HOSPITAL being set up. Again, cameras on the move,
     cables are lifted for moving flats. Actors in Bee Costumes
     entering and taking places. Belushi, annoyed at the costumes.

     We follow Lorne out of 8H --

33                                                                33
     STAIRWELL
                                                             58.
                          2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     Lorne rushing up the stairwell trailed by Neil. As they round
     a corner in the stairwell, we find Jim Henson waiting in
     ambush. He starts following Lorne up the stairs. Lorne
     doesn't slow down.

                         HENSON
               Mr. Michaels...

                         LORNE
               Mr. Henson, excited to see what you
               and your merry band of creatures
               have in store for us tonight...

                         HENSON
               Well, Lorne, we don't have any
               script pages. We're flying blind
               here. Muppet s don't riff.

                         LORNE
               Absolutely. This is the first I'm
               hearing of this. It's unacceptable.
                   (to Neil)
               Neil, Jim needs his pages!

                         HENSON
               Thank you. And can you please
               remind your crew not to leave the
               muppets in compromising positions?

                         LORNE
               That doesn't sound like them...

                         HENSON
               They left a note.

                         LORNE
               They didn't.

                         HENSON
               It said... (quietly) "Fuck-Rags For
               Rent."

                         LORNE
                   (stifles a laugh)
               I'll speak to Michael.

34                                                             34
     9TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

     Lorne heading with steam to his office.

     Lorne passes the green room door. Affiliates pour out, still
     drinking, Lorne navigates through them like Frogger...
                                                             57.

     LORNE'S 9TH FLOOR OFFICE

     Lorne takes a breath. His office is cleanly appointed. Black
     leather and old lamps. A LARGE WINDOW looking over Studio 8H.

                         LORNE
               Oh, hey Bernie...

     Turn to find BERNIE BRILLSTEIN on the sofa, with his whiskey.
     He motions to leave, but Lorne stops him.

                         LORNE (CONT'D)
                   (kindly waving him off)
               No, no, you're good.
                   (picks up the receiver)
               Hello, this is Lorne.

                         JOHNNY CARSON (O.C.)
               I was beginnin g to think you didn't
               like me.

                         LORNE
               Of course not, Mr. Carson. You're
               the voice of a generation.

                                                 LORNE (CONT'D)
          JOHNNY CARSON (O.C.)
     I just wanted to reach out,     That's very kind...
     say good luck tonight...

                         JOHNNY CARSON (CONT'D)
               And also, I suppose I just wanted
               to make sure we don't end up
               stepping on each other's dicks.

                                              JOHNNY CARSON (CONT'D)
                 LORNE
     Uh... Okay...                   I do five shows a week - They
                                     could run seven, but Saturday
                                     is a du mping ground, a
                                     graveyard. Who the fuck is
                                     watching TV then?

     Carson opines, but we barely listen. Lorne drops the jelly
     beans and goes to his WINDOW, looking over the stage floor.

     The CAMERA BOYS and STAGE HANDS are still working on that
     scene change.... You go this way... I'll go that way.

     Lorne spots Belushi surrounded by bee costumes - still
     mulling over his contract. Barely listening to Carson now.

                         LORNE (CONT'D)
               Right, of course....
                   (quietly)
               Sign it, you bastard.
                                                          56.

                    JOHNNY CARSON
          I do five shows a week - They could
          run seven, but Saturday is a
          dumping ground, a graveyard. Who
          the fuck is watching TV then? You
          know how this all started, don't
          you?

                    LORNE
          With a kite and a key?

                    CARSON
          Don't be a dipshit for a second,
          kid. I do five shows a week - They
          could run seven, but Saturday is a
          dumping ground, a graveyard. Who
          the fuck is watching TV then?

Belushi clicks the p en and is just about to sign his contract
when... Ebersol interrupts him...

                    LORNE
          No, No, No...

                    CARSON
          So I told Dave Tebet, look, you got
          to find something for the weekends.
          I don't give a shit if it's game
          shows or skin flicks.

Ebersol presents Belushi with a POLAROID CAMERA. A cute
polaroid rep nearby. Ebersol demos the instant film.

Belushi takes the camera with false interest...

                    LORNE
          ... Oh, don't let him hold the...

                    CARSON
          Who knows kid, maybe you'll carve
          out a little home amongst the dead
          beats and the bagheads.

Belushi hurls the camera. The Polaroid Rep takes chase.

                    CARSON (CONT'D)
          But here's a little friendly
          advice... Stay the fuck away from
          Burbank. Stay the fuck away from my
          guests. Stay the fuck away from
          me...

Lorne, nose to the glass now. We finally hear Johnny Carson.
                                                                 55.
                              2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                            JOHNNY CARSON (O.C.)
                  ... and I know Tebet's got a hard
                  on for Chevy Chase. Personally I
                  don't think that kid could ad-lib a
                  fart after a baked-bean dinner.

     Lorne inadvertently hangs up the phone. He steps out onto the
     - Watching as Belushi kicks over the bee costumes and storms
     off.

36                                                                 36
     9TH FLOOR UPPER DECK

     Lorne goes to say something, but it's too late.

                            JOE DICSO
                  Come on John! Where are you going?!

                            BELUSHI (O.C.)
                  I go where I'm kicked!

     Belushi vanishes.

37                                                                     37
     LORNE'S 9TH FLOOR OFFICE

     Lorne passing back through.

38                                                                     38
     9TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

     Lorne yanks Neil away from making a sandwich.

                            NEIL
                  How'd the call go?

                            LORNE
                  Tremendous, thank you for asking.

                                                      LORNE (CONT'D)
                    NEIL
     Oh, great!                           Belushi walked.

                              NEIL (CONT'D)
                  He quit?!

                            LORNE
                  Technically, he would need a job to
                  quit, but yes. We need to find him.
                  I'll take the 8th floor. You take
                  the 9th.

     Neil nods and leaves with his half sandwich. For the first
     time, CAMERA FOLLOWS NEIL as Lorne heads down a stairwell.
                                                               54.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     Neil stops at Jim Fox's office.

                         NEIL
               Have you seen Belushi?

     Fox on the phone, can't be bothered.

     Neil tries a couple more rooms.

                         NEIL (CONT'D)
               You guys seen Belushi...? Hey, I'm
               looking for Belushi, anyone seen
               him...? Anyone got eyes on John...?

     Everyone just brushes him off. Anne doesn't even pause.

                         ANNE
               I'm not an animal wrangler.

     Neil finally arrives at a closed door. Magic marker on white
     tape reads - THE DEP ARTURE LOUNGE. Light music can be heard.

39                                                               39
     THE DEPARTURE LOUNGE

     Neil opens the door and an Olympian cloud of smoke escapes.
     This is the green room for the Saturday Night band.

     Inside, a few instrumentalists play tunes, but mostly,
     they're just getting high before the show. PAUL SHAFFER (26),
     massive glasses and long hair (already thinning).

                         NEIL
               Anyone seen Belushi?

                         PAUL SHAFFER
               Sure, yeah, he was up he re hanging
               with us yesterday.

                         NEIL
                   (impatient)
               No, I mean lately?

     A musician hands Neil a TIGHTLY ROLLED JOINT.

                         PAUL SHAFFER
               You sound stressed, you need a hit?

     Neil considers this for a moment.

                         PAUL SHAFFER (CONT'D)
               Hey, what's the best that could
               happen?

     Neil nods and takes a long hit.

                         PAUL SHAFFER (CONT'D)
               Good luck on your quest amigo.

     Shaffer closes the door in Neil's face.

     9TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

     Neil now counting his steps. The weed is powerful and works
     quickly. Neil feels off balance.

     Garrett Morris, in bee costume, is suddenly in Neil's face.

                         GARRETT MORRIS
               Neil, who do you think I am?

                         NEIL
               You're a human bumble bee?

                         GARRETT MORRIS
               No man, what would you say my
               identity is on the show?

                         NEIL
               I can't answer that question! I
               don't have all the answers! I can't
               do this right now!

     Neil bugs out and runs ahead. He stops at Gilda (in toga)
     talking to Billy Crystal.

                         NEIL (CONT'D)
               Have you guys seen Belushi?

                 GILDA                         BILLY CRYSTAL
     Sweetie, are you okay?            Yeah buddy, why are you
                                       holding your face?

                         NEIL
               I don't know. I can hear my own
               blood. AM I GOING TO BE OK?

                         BILLY CRYSTAL
               She's not a nurse, kid.

                         NEIL
               I know that!

     Neil runs off, leaving us with Gilda and Billy.

                         BILLY CRYSTAL
               Should I be worried?
                                                               52.

               About Neil?

                         BILLY CRYSTAL
               No - Fuck Neil - About my set. I
               can't get a straight answer out of
               Lorne.

                         GILDA

     Meanwhile, Lorne searches room to room for Belushi when he
     runs smack dab into DAVE TEBET and a TUXEDOED COMEDIAN with
     greased back hair, tie undone, and a cigar.

                         TEBET
               Lorne, you know Milton Berle.

                          LORNE
               Absolutely. Big fan. G rew up on
               your work.

                         MILTON BERLE
               Who didn't? Heard it's your big

                         TEBET
               We're counting on it. How's it all
               coming?

                         LORNE
               Just... perfect.

                         TEBET
               Really. Nothing I can help with? I
               have a little pull, you know.

                         LORNE
               Honestly, it's been smooth sailing.

                 TEBET                          MILTON BERLE
     Well, you never hear that.        You certainly don't.

                         LORNE
               Yep. Being here must bring back all
               kinds of memories.

     They take the cross street towa rds Broadway. Milton takes a
     look into the wardrobe room. Sees Jackie doing her make-up.

          Sure. Used to call it the RCA Radio
          tower - Radio, that wonderful
          invention by which I could reach a
          million people... who fortunately
          couldn't reach me.

                    TEBET
          You know Milt's TV show once pulled
          a ninety seven share. Ninety seven
          percent of the American audience
          was watching Uncle Miltie.

As if on cue, some of the stage hands notice Milton. They all
know him. Hey buddy! Uncle Milty! Miss you!

                    LORNE
          You ever miss being Mr. Television?

                    MILTON BERLE
              (frowns)
          What is he talking about?

                    TEBET
          Lorne - Milton remains one of the
          peacock's brightest feathers.

                    MILTON BERLE
          It's quite a feather.

                    LORNE
          Of course...

                     MILTON BERLE
          And I'm looking forward to hosting
          your show.

They stop on Broadway.

                    LORNE
          Well (coughs) we'd be honored.
          There are still so many decisions.

                    MILTON BERLE
          I'm hearing episode five.

Boys upstairs love it.         They're the real boss.
Affiliates ate it up.

          At sixty seven, I still feel like a
          twenty year old, but unfortunately,
          there's never one around.

                    LORNE
          Your reputation precedes you.

                    MILTON BERLE
          Yeah, by about eleven inches.

Milton eyes Jackie in costumes and pursues his conquest.

                    MILTON BERLE (CONT'D)
          Excuse me a second.

                    TEBET
          Any sign of Belushi?

                    LORNE
          Hm? Oh, John? I believe he's in
          wardrobe. Why?

                    TEBET
          Legal is frantic for his paperwork.

                     LORNE
          Strang e. I'll look into that...

Lorne turns and goes for the CONTROL ROOM DOOR. Locked. He
embarrassingly has to knock again. For a moment, Lorne makes
eye contact with the TOSCANINI PORTRAIT.

                    TEBET
          Lorne, I can imagine what must be
          racing through your mind... the
          thought, no matter how improbable,
          that you might not make it to air.

                    LORNE
          Hadn't even occurred to me.

There's a hive of energy around them. No o ne seems to notice
the tension of the coming conversation.

                    TEBET
          Really? I heard you're having some
          technical difficulties?

                    LORNE
          Not that I know of...
                                                                 49.

               Oh, it's just that I had heard your
               writers were stoned, your actors
               were physically assaulting each
               other, the sound system was down
               and a fire broke out earlier...

     Lorne frozen. Tebet plows forward with a smile.

               Yes. Minor issues. Already

               Well, that's reassuring.

                         LORNE
               Oh, this whole conversation is a
               soothing shower of relief.

     Tebet knocks on the control room door for Lorne.

                         TEBET
               Good - Good. Look, if for some

               assured, the country would be happy
               to watch Johnny Carson.

                         LORNE
               I mean, we could always run the
               tape of dress rehearsal. Worst case

     Something catches Lorne's eye. He frowns. On one of the
     MONITORS. Lorne gets closer.

     It's an episode of THE TONIGHT SHOW.

                         LORNE (CONT'D)
               What is this? Why are you cueing up

                            LORNE
               Right...

     Lorne is interrupted by BARBARA. She's out of breath.

                         BARBARA
               Lorne! We found a lighting

               Great! Go get him.

                         BARBARA
               He's lighting a show right now.
               This will take massaging.

                         LORNE
               We don't have time... What floor?

     Already leaving the control room.

46                                                               46
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Speed walking to the elevators.

                         BARBARA
               Sixth floor. Some variety show.
                                                          45.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    LORNE
          He knows I'm coming...?

Barbara doesn't know.

Garret Morris sees Lorne and jumps into the procession.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Is this a bad time?

                    LORNE
          It's the perfect time. What's on
          your mind, Garrett?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Why'd you hire me?

                    LORNE
          You were cheap.

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Really?

                    LORNE
          I'm being ironical, Garrett.

Lorne slips into an elevator and it shuts behind him.

Garret steps away and almost runs into Gilda.

                    G ILDA
          Hey Garrett... What's wrong?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Nothing. I'm just trying to figure
          out exactly what I'm doing here.

                    GILDA
          What do you mean?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          Well, I just can't help feeling
          like an outsider.

                    GILDA
          ... Because you're so much older?

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          No. I'm... I'm not that much older.

                    GILDA
          You are a little bit older.
                                                                44.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                          GARRETT MORRIS
                No, look, I went to Juilliard. I've
                been on Broadway. I'm a published
                playwright. You know how many
                operas I've done?

                          GILDA
                I have no idea, Garrett.

                          GARRETT MORRIS
                Shit, while Danny and Laraine were
                eating Fruit Loops, I was
                performing La Traviata... in
                Italian. You dig?

                          GILDA
                Of course I dig, Garrett, but...
                    (a thought)
                No one is saying you can't sing on
                the show.

     Garret is about to say something but stops short.

     Prelap - DING!

47                                                               47
     6TH FLOOR HALLWAY

     Elevator doors open revealing Lorne and Barbara. The 6th
     floor feels like a time warp to old school variety TV.

     Lorne quickly moves between show girls, magicians, animal
     acts, a barbershop quartet. A minefield of mediocrity.

     Lorne makes it to the STAGE DOORS and plows through into...

48                                                                48
     STAGE 6G

     Lorne is stopped by the ARM of a production assistant. He's
     gestured to wait and be quiet until rehearsal is over.

     The stage - A SPLASHY 1970s d esign of starbursts and white
     risers. Showgirls in sequins and feathers separate to reveal
     none other than - MILTON BERLE. Singing. A Conga line forms.

     We swing back to Lorne and realize he is fixated on something
     else. A DIGITAL CLOCK - 10:49... becomes 10:50.

     Lorne breaks past the production assistant. He runs up the
     stairs of the empty bleachers, two at a time, past a couple
     unimpressed smoking grips all the way to the light booth.
                                                               43.
                           2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     At the lighting desk is a GRIZZLY OLD LIGHTING DIRECTOR, arms
     covered in Navy tattoos. He spills over the board with his
     cigarette, barking at his long-haired young assistant - CARL.

                         GRIZZLY LIGHTING DIRECTOR
               Fuck Carl, get your head out of
               your ass. Prep the cupcake lights
               and bring up the glitter.

     Lorne clocks the lighting director, then turns to Carl.

                         LORNE
               Carl, I have a job offer. It comes
               with no guarantees, no perks, and
               no weekends.

                         CARL
               How's the pay?

                         LORNE
               That's the worst part.

     Carl removes his headset. Follows Lorne. They run back down
     the bleachers, just as fast. A magician sets up on stage.

49                                                               49
     6TH FLOOR HALLWAY

     PLOWING through the stage doors and back down the hallway.
     Lorne falls over a PRODUCT DISPLAY for La Choy canned Chinese
     food, knocking cans everywhere.

50                                                               50
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWA Y

     We turn to find Billy Crystal and Valri Bromfield.

                         CRYSTAL
               What's the fastest you could do
               your set? Top to bottom.

                            VALRI
               5 minutes.

                         CRYSTAL
               Yeah, me too. Could you do it in 4?

                            VALRI
               Probably.

                         CRYSTAL
               Yeah, me too. They're gonna offer
               3, but we draw the line at 4.
                                                                42.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                          VALRI
                Okay. I want to do the show.

                          CRYSTAL
                We're doing the show. We just can't
                get jerked around.

                          VALRI
                But we're doing the show?

                          CRYSTAL
                Of course. We just need to be in
                this together.

51                                                                51
     STAGE 8H

     GREEK COLUMNS are being wheeled out as a BREAK ROOM set is
     wheeled in. Actors and actresses in Hair and Make-Up. A make-
     up assistant presents a Kleenex and Gilda spits out her gum.

     Leo has notably only laid down a bout 30% OF THE BRICKS.

     NBC Pages hand out updated pages. Cast and crew zip through,
     looking for changes. Chevy comes through like a lost dog.

                          CHEVY
                Anyone seen Jaqueline? My fiancee?

     Meanwhile - Gilda, Laraine, and Jane are switching costumes
     in QUICK CHANGE BOOTHS. They emerge in construction worker
     costumes. Rosie is there to direct them.

                          ROSIE
                Gilda, why don't you put your foot
                up over on that benc h there...

                          CHEVY
                    (wandering through)
                You gals seen Jackie?

     The actresses shake their heads. They can't help him.

     We turn to find Danny, wearing a small courtesy robe. He's
     tugging away at whatever costume he's wearing underneath.
     It's clearly too tight and riding up his ass.

                          AYKROYD
                    (to Rosie)
                Hey... is this really necessary?
                                                            41.
                      2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    ROSIE
              (flirty)
          Are you kidding hot stuff, you're
          going to melt every TV in America.

We catch Danny using the same line he used on Gilda earlier.

                    AYKROYD
          Ma'am, you know, you're dealing
          with a fully qualified male
          strumpet.

                      ROSIE
          Oh yeah?

                     AYKROYD
          I have a work order here which
          specifies that I am to roger your
          roundly...

Laraine looks over to see Danny flirting with Rosie. She
tries not to react. Gilda catch es the moment as well and
distracts Laraine by fixing her helmet.

Aykroyd looks close enough to kiss Rosie when Lorne
approaches and there's just no time to recover.

                    LORNE
              (to Danny)
          Any idea where Belushi might be?

                    ROSIE
          Haven't seen him.

Aykroyd is a deer in headlights.

                      ROSIE (CONT'D)
          Danny...?

                    AYKROYD
          Well... John is an anarchist and an
          Illinois Alpha Male.

                    LORNE
          What does that mean?

                    AYKROYD
          You know... uh... You a nd I might
          approach this vast space like 15th
          century peasants entering the
          Vatican, but Mr. Belushi's a whole
          other animal. He's a skeptic and a
          troublemaker. I'd give O'Houlihans
          a recce.
                                                        40.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    ROSIE SHUSTER
              (translating)
          He's at the bar next door.

Lorne nods and turns to Rosie.

                    LORNE
          Barbara is still asking about your
          credit on the show.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
          Whatever you think.

                    LORNE
          Hey, it's your name.

Lorne finds another problem. Half the bricks at Home Base are
still in a pile. Leo trowels as fast as he can. Lorne checks
his watch and eyes the shop steward.

                    SHOP STEWARD
          We'd help if we could, but we'r e
          routing for the little guy.

                    LORNE
          At least your heart's in it.

Lorne steps away and we pan back to Aykroyd.

                    AYKROYD
          Are we good? Is he alright?

                    ROSIE
          Young man, whatever's happening
          here between you and me is the last
          thing on his mind right now.

                    AYKROYD
          The man doesn't wrestle with the
          green-eyed monster?

                    ROSIE
          Hardly. Look, one day, on his way
          home from grade school, Lorne stops
          at a construction site, and just
          watches these two wild maniacal
          girls jumping on boards. He just
          stood there, forever, transfixed by
          - me - The girl with the toilet
          paper tits.

                    AYKROYD
          You can get arrested for that.
                                                        39.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    ROSIE
          We were kids.

                    STAGE HAND
              (interrupting)
          Hey Rosie, sweetheart, mind
          stepping off that cable.

                    ROSIE
          Yeah, you got it, Moose.
              (back to her story)
          Anyhow, Lorne lost his dad at
          fourteen. His mom sold everything.
          He went a year without furniture. I
          thought he was just a stray,
          looking for a warm piece of carpet.
          Like he wanted to be a part of my
          family and I was his kid sister or
          something. But then, h ormones,
          turns out I am NOT his little
          sister. So we started dating and I
          thought, alright, he wants to build
          a family - With me. So we got
          married, bought a house and stuff.
          No ring or anything, I think those
          are pretty stupid. But linens.
          China. Anyhow, it turns out, I'm
          not the kid sister or the wife. I'm
          the writer.

                    DANNY
          And who's he...?

Aykroyd won't get his answer just yet.

                     JOE DICSO (O.C.)
          Ever yone on their marks!

DON PARDO steps up to a mic, holding his headphones.

                    DON PARDO (O.C.)
          We now take you to Ancient Greece
          as...

STAGE HANDS hear this and are caught off guard. They begin
moving GIANT COLUMNS INTO PLACE...

                    JOE DICSO
          Wo, wo, wo... Not yet, Don! Wrong
          sketch, buddy.

Stage almost barrel into the camera boys.
                                                         38.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    JOE DICSO (CONT'D)
          Back to one...

Rosie now next to the camera to direct the rehearsal.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
          Okay, action girls.

Gilda tips her construction helmet and smiles.

                    GILDA
              (brassy New York)
          Now that you've mastered all the
          technical know-how, it's time we
          work on your sidewalk skills.
              (gestures to Danny)
          Daniel over here has kindly offered
          to aid us in a live demonstration.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER
              (directing)
          Danny, enter f rom the right.

Danny, clearly uncomfortable, steps into the stage space.

                    ROSIE SHUSTER (CONT'D)
              (directing)
          And take off the robe...

Danny sighs and does so, revealing a skin tight red shirt and
suffocating Daisy Dukes.

Immediately, whistles from off camera. Danny is clearly
genuinely embarrassed in front of the crew. Rosie smiles,
having engineered this moment.

                     GILDA
          Now, when a little piece of heaven
          like Dan ny walks by...
              (to Danny)
          Strut your stuff, cupcake.
              (to the girls)
          Here's how you make him feel right
          at home...

Danny is visibly embarrassed and struggling to stay in
character. We can see Gilda already enjoying this.

                    GILDA (CONT'D)
          Hey, beefcakes, yeah you!

Gilda nods to Jane, who nervously approaches.
                                                          37.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    ROSIE SHUSTER
              (directing)
          And Jane, try putting your foot up
          on the bench.

                     JANE
              (to Rosie)
          This good?
              (adorably nervous)
          Yeah, dreamboat, what's da matter?
          A smile isn't gonna cost ya
          anything.

                    GILDA
              (to Danny)
          Okay, be a doll and move those gams
          for us...

Danny gives a little walk in his costume. Gilda follows
closely with her hands out.

                    GILDA (CONT'D)
          Voom, va-va-voom! Voom, va-va voom!

Stage hands eating this up.

                    SH OP STEWARD
          Show him how to do it, Gilda.

Gilda nods to Laraine - Give it to him.

                    LARAINE
          Hey stud muffins, want to make
          bouncy bouncy?

Rosie whistles from off camera.

The crew joins in with a few more whistles. Comments start to
fire off from behind camera. Danny seems genuinely
embarrassed and is barely in character.

Joy chunks?                       now.

                    LARAINE
              (tosses a glove)
          Hey, you dropped something.

Danny plays along. He pick the glove up, bending over.

                    LARAINE (CONT'D)
          Nice. Work that little caboose.

                                            LARAINE (CONT'D)
            GILDA
Hey, hey, hey, come on, baby.    Yeah, crazy pecs! Why don't
                                 ya flex'em for me, butch?

Okay, okay...                    They are so cute when they're
                                 mad.

Danny has fully broken character and is now just blushing.

                    ROSIE
              (tosses him his robe)
          Alright, cover yours elf up...

Gilda puts her arm around Laraine.

                    DON PARDO (O.C.)
          We now take you to Ancient Greece
          as Alexander the Great attends his
          Ten Year High School Reunion!

                    JOE DICSO
          Okay, that's you, Rocky, Hal...
          cameras are on the move... columns
          are in... five, four... Hey Frank,
          you still on the clock?

Stage hands on the move with columns... Cameras peds whip out
of the way... The sound booms whips up to make room... A
cable is lifted on a pole so a flat can slide through...

It's actually working when...

                    CARLIN (O.C.)
          ARE YOU SHITTING ME WITH THIS
          COSTUME?!

Carlin bou nds onto the stage floor at full volume. He's
dressed as Alexander the Great. All attention is now on him.

Everything crashes to a stop.

Lorne sees Tebet watching everything and swoops in.

                    LORNE
          How can I help, George?

                    CARLIN
          I mean what is this shit? Why am I
          dolled up like a fucking towel boy
          at Caesar's?

            LORNE                           DON PARDO
You're playing Alexander the      ... Ten Year High School
                             *
Great at his...                   Reunion!

                    CARLIN
          Uh huh.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Exactly - So, when Chevy asks what
          you've been up to, your response is
          "Oh you know, mostly conquering the
          known universe."

                    CARLIN
          And this is for television?

                    LORNE
              (one eye on Tebet)
          Yes, what's your concern?

                    CARLIN
          My concern is why I let my agent
          convince me to do your show.
              (waving sides)
          I mean, what is this script? Feels
          like a Spruce Goose. Lotta wood, no
          lift off.

                     O'DONOGHUE
              (flat)
          Is that right?

                    LORNE
          Perhaps a rewrite... We have...
              (checks his watch)
          Jesus Christ...

                    O'DONOGHUE
              (mulls this over)
          George, I hear you.

                    CARLIN
          Thanks.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          I think I understand the reason you
          might be struggling.

                    LORNE
          Yes and we want to make it work.

                                               LORNE (CONT'D)
          O'DONOGHUE
Yeah, you see these are            Sketches.
`scenes'

          O'DONOGHUE (CONT'D)                  LORNE (CONT'D)
... That revolve around            ... Michael...
`acting'.

                    O'DONOGHUE (CONT'D)
          That must feel foreign when you're
          just a ponytailed vulture, feeding
          off the corpse of Lenny Bruce.

Lorne just stares at O'Donoghue.

                    CARLIN
              (smiling)
          You know, you're right. I'd hate to
          make these skits any worse than
          they already are. Thank god no one
          will be watching. Enjoy your
          fucking circle jerk.

Carlin storms off. Leaves his crown.

A beat as Schiller walks by with the SAGE.

For a moment, Lorne is lost in the chaos of the set.
Carpentry, masonry, lights buzzing, speaker futzing.

Lorne looks over to see Dave Tebet whispering something to
Dick Ebersol. Lorne exits.

Meanwhile, Chevy rounds the back of the ancient greek set to
find Jackie in a toga... and Milton Berle all over her.

                    CHEVY
          Hey hon, they need us in Athens.

         MILTON BERLE                          JACKIE
Jesus, who's this guy?             Chevy, Milton taped a show
                                   here back in 1956, isn't that
                                   neat?

                    CHEVY
          She's taken.

                    MILTON BERLE
          What hours? I'll take the rest of
          the evening.

            CHEVY                             JACKIE
Excuse me...?                     He's kidding...

                    MILTON BERLE
          Yeah, buddy, I'm kidding.

                    CHEVY
          That's sweet. I remember when you
          used to do comedy.

                    MILTON BERLE
          Funny, cause I've never heard of
          you.

                    CHEVY
          Probably the Alzheimers. What's the
          matter, did you wander off onto an
          actual TV set? Hey darling, look,
          it's the ghost of television past.
          He used to be a n institution. Now
          he needs one.

                    MILTON BERLE
          If you want my comeback, you're
          going to have to scrape it off the
          back of your mom's teeth.

Jackie guffaws.

                    CHEVY
          You're going to laugh at that?

                    MILTON BERLE
          Listen sweetheart, there's plenty
          more where that came from.

                      JACKIE
          Oh god...

And just like that, Milton Berle unzips and unravels his
prodigious third leg. Jackie and Chevy stammer.

                    MILTON BERLE
          Oh, do I have your attention? I
          have two stars on the walk of fame.
          Who gives a shit. I once held
          ninety percent of the television
          viewing audience. Pleh. That's not
          what they're going to remember.

               They're gonna remember Mr.
               Television. Their Uncle Miltie. Who
               the fuck are you? You're not a
               star, kid. You're barely in the
               building. You're not even a
               swinging dick.
                   (to Jackie)
               Call me after he's done crying.

     Milton zips up and walks away.

     Over the speakers, we hear the strum of a harp, followed by
     the voice of Don Pardo.

                         DON PARDO (O.C.)
               We now take you to Ancient Greece
               as...

                         JOE DICSO (O.C.)
               We're not going to Ancient Greece!

     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Lorne pops through the Main Street doors, running immediately
     into Laraine in her reporter's costume, flanked by a couple
     costume assistants.

                         LARAINE
               I think we figured it out!

                         LORNE
               Figured what out?

     And just like that, in a flash, Laraine transforms from
     reporter into her ancient Greek toga. Like a magic trick.

                          LORNE (CONT'D)
               We c ut the toga sketch.

                         LARAINE
               Oh.

     Lorne strides towards Broadway. Audrey joins him in step.

                         AUDREY
                   (direct as ever)
               Even without Alexander, we're still
               thirty over. Perhaps we don't need
               four musical performances...? Or we
               could trim one of the Carlin
               monologues...
                                                        31.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


Lorne nods. He goes to the Run Of Show board and rips
everything off it. It's cacophonous as all the cards fall in
a pile on the floor.

                    LORNE
          Are we under now?

Lorne turns to go but is stopped by Billy and Valri.

                    BILLY CRYSTAL
          Lorne... We've been talking, and we
          can't accept less than four minutes
          a piece. That's four for me and
          four for Valri. We've worked too
          hard on our material to accept
          anything less. I'm afraid it's four
          or nothing.

                    LORNE
          Two minutes.

                    BILLY CRYSTAL
          You need me to cut two minutes?

                    LORNE
          No, I need two minutes of material.
          It's two minutes or nothing.

Billy cocks his head. Trying to read the moment.

                      BILLY CRYSTAL
          Lorne, is this for real? I killed
          at dress... I was the only act that
          killed at dress.

                    LORNE
          Can you do it in two?

                    BILLY CRYSTAL
          I can't even set it up in two.

                    LORNE
          Then I don' t know what to say. I'm
          sorry it didn't work out.
              (turns to Valri)
          Can you make it work in two?

                    VALRI
              (without hesitating)
          Yes. Yes I can.

Lorne nods, walks away.

Billy turns to look at Valri. His world shatters.
                                                                30.

     We chase Ebersol as he follows Lorne into the stairwell.

53                                                                53
     STAIRWELL

     Ebersol approaches Lorne carefully.

                           EBERSOL
                 I was thinking... Why don't we
                 punt? Come back stronger next week,
                 debut with Paul Simon...

                           LORNE
                 Oh, was that what you were
                 thinking?

                           EBERSOL
                 We're just not ready.

                           LORNE
                 We don't go on because we're ready.
                 We go on because it's 11:30.

                           EBERSOL
                 Hey, no one wants this show to
                 succeed more than I do.

                           LORNE
                 Is that so?

                           EBERSOL
                 I mean, yeah, I hired you, Lorne. I
                 stayed up all night at the fucking
                 Chateau Mormont listening to your
                 heady theories on comedy because I
                 believe in you. I take it up the
                 ass from this network every day,
                 because I believe in this show. And
                 I'm telling you, we should run the
                 dress rehearsal and claw back a win
                 next Saturday. It's in everyone's
                 best interest - Mainly yours.

                           LORNE
                 Are you...? Was that a threat?

                           EBERSOL
                 No, I'm trying to give you advice.

     Neil pops his head in at the exact wrong moment.

                  NEIL                               LORNE
        (chipper)                        Thank you Neil.
     Twenty Five minutes!
                                                         29.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


Neil disappears. Lorne turns to Ebersol.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Thanks for the advice. We can't.
          It's a live show.

                    EBERSOL
          No one will know the difference.

                    LORNE
          We just can't.

                    EBERSOL
          Lorne, you need to start adjusting
          your concept of what you can and
          cannot do...

                    LORNE
          We can't because there is no tape,
          alright?! I didn't record the dress
          rehearsal. Now we don't have to
          argue about it.

Ebersol is stunned. His face tightens.

                    EBERSOL
          Are you fucking kidding me?

                    LORNE
              (deep breath)
          We just need to make it to air.

                    EBERSOL
          I'm not going to be able to protect
          you.

                                             EBERSOL (CONT'D)
            LORNE
I'm used to that.               Screw you.

                    EBERSOL (CONT'D)
          Do you know how much bullshit never
          makes it to your ears because I am
          the wall they hit.

                    LORNE
          Tell that to your Polaroid rep.
          She's cute.

                     EBERSOL
          O h, I'm sorry you need a sponsor
          for a show that can't pull a single
          advertiser. You know they're giving
          out the ads for free? For free.

                       LORNE
             Frankly, NBC is lucky to have
             something as relevant as this show.

                       EBERSOL
             Lucky? They don't even want it!

                       LORNE
             Yes, that's logical, that's why
             they've paid us all to be here -
             Because they don't want our show.

                       EBERSOL
             They want you to fail.

Lorne scoffs.

                       EBERSOL (CONT'D)
             They're betting on it. NBC makes
             more money playing reruns of the
             Tonight Show on Saturday.

                       LORNE
             So why don't they?

                       EBERSOL
             Contract dispute. They need to
             prove to Johnny Carson that the
             reruns are inevitable. So, they
             built a show that was guaranteed to
             fail.

Lorne doesn't have a quick response this time.

                       EBERSOL (CONT'D)
             Ninety minutes of live television
             by a group of kids in their
             twenties who've never made
             anything? Did you ever stop to
             wonder why they said yes?

He didn't.

                       EBERSOL (CONT'D)
             A counter culture show starring
             total unknowns with zero narrative
             and even less structure? Are you so
             arrogant that you never even
             questioned this?

Lorne is speechless.
                                                               27.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                         EBERSOL (CONT'D)
               Look, this is what's going to
               happen at 11:30 tonight. Okay? All
               your actors will be on their marks.
               Band's tuned up. Joe's hollering
               out the count down. You'll be in
               the control room and Dave Tebet
               will be standing, probably right
               next to you. And right as the
               screen goes black, Tebet will point
               with his big ass jeweled up index
               finger and say "Go to Carson". And
               that'll be that.

     Ebersol b egins to exit. Stops at the door.

                         EBERSOL (CONT'D)
               I know you all make fun of me and
               my clothes behind my back. But I'm
               killing myself for this show.
                   (then, quietly)
               Also... Polaroid is cool.

     Ebersol exits. Lorne is alone in the stairwell. He just
     breathes in a long silence. Out of chess moves.

     Deep breath. Gathers.

     Lorne approaches the door back into the hallway. Steps
     through and...

     SPLASH! - A GALLON OF BLOOD HITS LORNE IN THE CHEST!

54                                                               54

     8TH FLOOR - BETWEEN MAIN ST AND BROADWAY

     A beat as Lorne takes in the moment. Dripping gore.

            TOM DAVIS (O.C.)               AL FRANKEN (O.C.)
     Oh shit, Lorne!                 It worked!

     Reveal Tom and Al holding the blood pump.

                         LORNE
                   (quiet)
               Nice work, fellas. A little heavy
               on the flow. But very funny.

               TOM DAVIS                       AL FRANKEN
     Sorry about the clothes.        And your face.

                          LORNE
                Art is but a measure of sacrifice
                and tears. Not quite ready for
                tonight, but we'll keep it on a
                special list.

     He taps the wall and begins to walk away with a SIGH.

     Lorne rounds the corner onto MAIN STREET. He encounters the a
     growing audience lining up. He makes eyes with a few folks,
     smiles meekly, still dripping.

     Finally past the gauntlet, he arrives at an open elevator --

56                                                              56
     ELEVATOR

     Jim Henson is standing quietly inside the elevator.

                          HENSON
                Is this an OK time?

                          LORNE
                Ideal.

     Lorne is dripping fake blood on the elevator floor. The
     elevator man eyes him warily.

                          HENSON
                Look, I know what people say when
                they see a man with his arm up a
                muppet. But this isn't just kid's
                stuff. There's room for high stakes
                puppetry on grown-up TV and... I
                get the sense that some of the
                writers on the 17th floor don' t
                respect us.

                          LORNE
                Strong words.

                          HENSON
                I don't use them lightly.

                          LORNE
                You didn't like the pages.

                          HENSON
                There were no pages.

                          LORNE
                Fair criticism.

     DING! Elevator doors open.

                 Lobby.

      Lorne walks through the lobby and out into the night.

56A                                                             56A
      50TH STREET

      We follow Lorne into the quiet of midtown Manhattan late on a
      Saturday night. True to form, no one flinches as a blood-
      soaked man meanders on the sidewalk.

      Still struggling to fill his quota, the NBC PAGE calls out -

                           NBC PAGE
                 Hey, any interest in free tickets
                 to a taping tonight--

      Without saying a word, Lorne grabs the Page's clipboard and
      HURLS IT into the middle of the road. A truck runs it over.

                           NBC PAGE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                 Hey!

      Lorne stumbles a couple doors down. O'HOULIHANS BAR. Lorne
      goes to enter when he sees Billy Crystal at a subway
      entrance. Debating whether to descend and go home. He thinks,
      then walks downstairs, a broken man.

      Lorne sighs and we follow him into --

57                                                               57
      DIVE BAR

      A crummy midtown watering hole. Lorne walk s in, looks around.

      A smattering of old drunks and a few bridge and tunnel
      couples looking for some fun in the big city. At one end of
      the room sits a long walnut bar. Opposite the bar is a low
      stage set against a red brick wall.

      On the stage, a BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN.

                            BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN
                 My family, they never quite fit in
                 here... My great grandfather even
                 fought in the civil war - He fought
                 for th e West!

      Lorne sits at the bar, cleans off his face with a bar-cloth.

                           LORNE
                 Vodka, double, fast.

                    BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN
          A drunk stands before the bench.
          Judge says, You've been brought
          here for drinking. The drunk says -
          Okay, what are we having?

Some GROANS from the crowd. The comedian singles someone out
in the audience.

                    BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          You think you're so funny? Look at
          you... Was anyone else hurt in the
          accident?

The bartender pours out a shot.

                    LORNE
          Thanks.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Fuck! Bullshit.

Lorne t urns to stare at the agitated young man sitting beside
him. He sits poised over a composition NOTEBOOK.

The man seems to shudder every time the audience misses a
joke, crossing out lines in his notebook like a violent
stenographer. This is ALAN ZWEIBEL (23).

Lorne turns to the young man.

                    LORNE
          What's happening here?

                    ZWEIBEL
          I get paid seven bucks a joke - if
          it gets a laugh. This putz is
          taking bulletproof material and
          filling it with lead.

Lorne putting it together.

                    LORNE
          You wrote his jokes?

                    BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN
          Yesterday, I told my doctor, I've
          got a ringing in my ear. He said,
          Don't answer it.

A few chuckles. Alan deflates again.

          Why don't you perform them
          yourself?

                    ZWEIBEL
          Look at me. This is how much I
          sweat - off stage.

Behind them, the comedian closes to tepid applause.

Lorne points to a thick binder on the bar.

                    LORNE
          This your joke book? How many you
          got in here?

                    ZWEIBEL
          Eleven hundred. Single spaced.

                    LORNE
          Mind if I...?

Alan slides the notebook on the bar. Lorne starts leafing
through. Smiles at a joke.

                    BORSCHT BELT COMEDI AN (O.C.)
          That was rough. Shit crowd.

                    ZWEIBEL
          Yep, that was it.

The comedian joins them. He fishes out a change purse and
starts pulling out crumpled singles and a handful of change.

                    ZWEIBEL (CONT'D)
          Hey, what's with the quarters?

                    BORSCHT BELT COMEDIAN
          I changed the punchline from 46 to
          49 on the one about the Buick -
          Much bigger laugh, so I figure I
          only owe you 3.50 for that one.

             LORNE                           ZWEIBEL
   (to Zweibel)                   I want a defibrillator.
Do you want a j ob?

          You serious? This kid?
              (to Zweibel)
          Tell him what you really do.

                barely do that.

                              (to Zweibel)
                      How much do you need to live?

                          ZWEIBEL
                I make three bucks an hour at the
                deli. Match that.

     Lorne extends a hand.

                            LORNE
                Let's go.

     Zweibel gathers his things and follows Lorne out.

                          ZWEIBEL
                When do we start?

     Lorne checks his watch.

                          LORNE
                Jesus christ.

     And just like that, Lorne and his newest hire are outside.

     They step outside and begin walking back to the NBC entrance.

               I'm thinking, maybe we should go to
               Mrs. Ed for comment.

                         LORNE
                   (laughs)
               Next week. Go to Claremont Stables
               on 89th and pick out a Tennessee
               Walker or something.

                         ZWEIBEL
               How bout a Palomino. I think Mr. Ed
               would have graduated to fucking
               blondes.

     Lorne hears something and PEELS OFF, turns back to Zweibel.

                         LORNE
               8th floor. Follow the trail of
               blood.

     Lorne continues to follow a sound - The unmistakab le slicing
     sound of skating. He smiles.

     For a moment, just quiet. We walk with Lorne as he takes in
     the magnitude of what he's trying to pull off. He walks by
     pedestrians and pays them no mind.

     However, we begin to notice something unusual about the
     people that brush by. Their clothes... their hair... there's
     something recognizable. Each person who passes is a vision of
     SNL's future -

     Wayne and Gart h, Roseanne Roseannadana, Mr. Robinson, Stefon,
     the Church Lady, the Blues Brothers, Mary Katherine
     Ghallager, Hanz and Franz, the Cheerleaders, the Nerds,
     Samurai, Pat, Stuart, Mango, Dieter, Two Wild and Crazy Guys.

     Lorne is on the precipice of changing comedy as we know it...
     yet he has no idea. Right now, he's just a 29 year old,
     wondering if he'll make it to tomorrow.

John throws her a look and goes into a spin.

                    GILDA (CONT'D)
          Maybe this is the last time we'll
          be just a couple of shmos.

                       JOHN
          Hm. Maybe.

                    GILDA
          You ever have nostalgia for a
          moment while you're still in it?

                    JOHN
          I don't know.

                    GILDA
          I mean you're in the moment, but
          you're also looking back on it.
          Like right now - I'm here - But I'm
          also thinking about this moment
          twenty years from now. We're
          walking by this rink, m aybe it's
          Christmas, our kids are dragging us
          by our pinkies, and all we can
          think about is this moment, right
          before we went on TV.

                    JOHN
          Who says we need to be on TV?

                    LORNE (O.C.)
          The NBC liability clause forbids
          you from ice skating.

We pan over to reveal Lorne, now standing next to Gilda.

                    GILDA
              (quietly)
          I found John.

          Thank you, Gilda.

Belushi is already off. He starts a fast circle, around the
perimeter. His legs chopping at the ice like a thoroughbred.
For a moment, we remember that he was a high school athlete.
He might actually pull this off... He's right on the edge...
he takes flight, spins... and comes crashing dow n, sliding
across the ice and hitting the boards - THUMP.

Gilda yelps in fear! Lorne leaps up and slides over the ice

     Lorne approaches the nearest door to the lobby of the
     building. Of course , it's locked.

     Lorne spots the first object he can find... a SCULPTURAL
     PEACOCK. He picks it up and BREAKS THE WINDOW with it.

     Lorne walks back into the stage. Still hammering.

     He passes a ROCK SOUND CREW, long hair, torn jeans. Then he
     hears it -- NEW SOUND. Audio Cables being connected. Lorne
     makes a silent prayer to the gods. Maybe Prometheus.

     We pass Alan Zweibel hiding behind a FAKE PLANT. Suddenly,
     Gilda joins him, in the plant.

                 This is Bernie. He represents...
                 all of us, I think?

     We see that Leo has notably finished only 60% OF THE BRICKS!

     A BOOM SOUND qu iets the entire stage.

                 The fuck was that?

          Garret! Don't you know a song?!

Garrett Morris enters frame and steps up to the boom. He
parts his lips and out comes an OPERA NOTE of such purity and
beauty, you almost forget what movie you're watching.

We begin to circle Garrett as he holds this impossible

segues into a song of his own writing...

                    GARRETT MORRIS
          ...IIIIII'M GONNA GET M E A SHOTGUN
          AND KILL ALL THE WHITIES I SEE...
          I'M GONNA GET ME A SHOTGUN AND KILL
          ALL THE WHITIES I SEE...

We move through the room, catching reactions. Apprehension,
humor, confoundment...

Billy Preston's Band loves it and offers accompaniment.

                    GARRETT MORRIS (CONT'D)
          ...WHEN I KILL ALL THE WHITIES I
          SEE... AND WHITEY, HE WON'T BOTHER
          ME... I'M GOING TO GET ME A SHOTGUN
          AND KILL ALL THE WHITIES I SEE...

Garre tt crescendos and bows to thunderous applause.

                     LORNE
          Bravo!

It's then that Lorne notices Ebersol standing with Tebet...
and all FIFTY AFFILIATES from the Green Room. Now on the
stage floor. Lorne nearly double takes (but doesn't).

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Oh hello, gentlemen, how long have
          you been standing there?

          Long enough.

          Look around Lorne. You haven't
          locked a script. Your actors are
          missing. Your crew's in open
          rebellion. Forget what standards
          and practices have to say. They'd
          be laughing at you in Burbank.

Rosie steps in.

                    ROSIE
          But this isn't Burbank. It's New
          York fucking City.

It's gone quiet. Lorne looks over at Rosie.

                     LORNE
          We have a hell of a show. We have
          two bands.

                    ROSIE
          Three if you count Janis Ian.

                    LORNE
          We have seven of the brightest
          comedy minds alive...

          Saturday.

                    LORNE
          Come on man. Everybody in this room
          has been killing themselves all
          week to make something special. To
          make something innovative and
          actually good. Have you done this
          so long, that you can't recognize
          the potential for greatness when
          it's right in front of your eyes?

                    TEBET
          Do you even know what this show is?

And finally, Lorne is able to answer the question.

                    LORNE
          It's an all nighter in the city.
          It's catching Richard Pryor at a
          drop in, or finding Paul Simon
          strumming in the back of a dive
          bar. It's meeting a girl outside a
          bodega and getting lucky in a phone
          booth. It's everything you think is
          going to happen when you move to
          the city.

The words play through the room beautifully.

Bee Hospital...                  You're not helping...

The sound of a NEEDLE HITTING A RECORD interrupts them.

We turn to find ANDY KAUFMAN on stage with his RECORD PLAYER.
The MIGHTY MOUSE theme song begins to play. Lorne, jaw on the
floor, doesn't know quite what to do.

The affiliates start bobbing along to the music. We move
through the room catching smiles and nods from the whole
crew. It's a unifying moment.

We arrive back at Andy just in time for the chorus...

                    ANDY KAUFMAN
          HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY!

The crew APPLAUDS. Lorne spins to the Affiliates... They find
it hilarious. They're on board!

Lorne runs up to Andy. Lifts the needle off the record.

                    LORNE
              (pats Andy on the back)
          Save your voice. BRING IN UPDATE!

                    DON PARDO
          AND NOW... WEEKEND UPDATE...

The Weekend Update Set comes sliding in.

The Affiliates take a step closer to see what's next.

Lorne comes running down to the desk. A costume assistant is
waiting with Lorne's wardrobe change.

Lorne turns to Chevy, who is still stinging from his mo ment
with Milton Berle. Lorne puts a hand on his shoulder.

                    LORNE
          You take it.

                    CHEVY
          Are you sure?

                    LORNE
          The show needs a face.

                    CHEVY
          Should I make up a name for the
          news anchor?

                    LORNE
          Use Chevy Chase. No one will
          believe it anyway.

Chevy hops up and takes the desk, measuring it with his arms.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Remember, when you look in the
          lens, you make eye contact with
          America.

Before Chevy can absorb that...

                     DON PARDO
          W EEKEND UPDATE... WITH CHEVY CHASE!

The affiliates light up! They LOVE Chevy.

Just then, AL SIEGEL, the cue card guy fumbles the cards.
They tumble to the ground. He scurries to grab them.

Chevy improvs a beat. Picks up the phone on the desk.
                                                          11.

          Hey doll... What are you wearing...
          I bet it does...

Alan Zweibel seizes the moment and slides Chevy a card.

Chevy gives it a quick read and smiles.

                    CHEVY (CONT'D)
              (to camera)
          The Post Office announced today
          that it is going to issue a stamp
          commemorating prostitution in the
          United States. It's a ten cent
          stamp, but if you want to lick it,
          it's a quarter.

This BRINGS THE HOUSE DOWN.

Chevy buzzes wi th the win. Bangs the desk with his fist!

                    BARBARA
          We need to open the doors...

Lorne turns to Tebet, who holds stoically. He can feel the
pressure of the affiliates around him. Finally, he nods.

              LORNE                            AUDREY
Let `em in.                       Thank God.

Everyone is on the move again. Camera pushes into Chevy.

                    CHEVY
              (looks into lens)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Billy
          Preston!

The Billy Preston band KICKS TO LIFE with the song "Nothing
F or Nothing". The stage feeds off their energy.

We look up to see audience members beginning to enter from
the 9th floor deck into the bleachers.

We move to HOME BASE, where Yoshimura is struggling to
finish. Stage Hands still watching.

                    SHOP STEWARD
          This floor ain't going to lay
          itself. Come on, grab a brick!

The stage hands get to their knees and start laying the floor
with Leo. Even Chevy jumps in.

                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


Lorne is taking in all the action. Barbara Gallagher presents
Carl from the 6th floor.

                    BARBARA GALLAGHER
          Lorne, remember Carl?

                    LORNE
          Carl?... Oh Carl!!
              (to the lighting board)
          You ever used one of these?

                    CARL
          Not-a once.

                    LORNE
          You'll pick it up in no time.

We look up as the SKYLIGHT PIECE swings out over Home Base.

                    LORNE (CONT'D)
          Keep it steady boys.

We see Neil warming up the audience with a magic trick.

Carbunkle, NB C Standards, stops Ebersol mid-stride.

                    CARBUNKLE
              (referencing the script)
          Dick, question on page 26 of the
          script. What is a "golden shower"?

Some of the stage hands look up. Ebersol stammers. Lorne
opens his mouth to cover, but Rosie jumps in --

                     ROSIE
               (pure bullshit)
          ... It's a yoga practice... in
          which practitioners greet the new
          day... by allowing the warm rays of
          the golden sun... to `shower' over
          th eir skin and warm their chakras.
               (adding)
          It's a California thing.

Carbunkle nods skeptically. Tom Schiller enters with sage.

                    TOM SCHILLER
              (pitching in)
          Oh yeah, started at Esalen. I've
          had at least fifty golden showers.

                         EBERSOL
                   (with sudden authority)
               You heard him Sue, sign the damn
               script. We're going to air!

     Carbunkle is shaken into focus and SIGNS the script in an
     officious way. She hands it over to Ebersol. He looks over at
     Lorne, finally a full blood member of the family.

                         JOE DICSO
               We're live in five minutes!

     The "Wolverines" set is slid into place. Even as it lands,
     artists are painting the furniture on to the w all.

                         LEO
               Will this work?

                         ROSIE
               Of course it will. It's nostalgic.
               It's Honeymooners. It has to work.

     Lorne looks up at the audience settling in as he disappears
     under the bleachers. Zweibel is flipping through his joke
     notebook and dictating to the cue card writers.

64                                                                64
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Inside the Make-Up Room, Jackie Carlin is doing a touch up on
     Chevy's make up.

     Nearby, Jane is running her lines in the mirror.

                         JANE CURTIN
               I'm Jane Curtin, and welcome to
               another episode of Victims of Shark
               Bite.

     A the Run Of Show board. Lorne takes a deep breath. He begins
     to pin the show back up. He discards sketches and pins others
     with confidence. A small crowd begins to gather.

                 LORNE                          AYKROYD
     Can you get that wig on in      You got it boss.
     thirty seconds?

                 LORNE (CONT'D)               DAVE WILSON
     Will the crane get there?       It'll happen.

               Laraine, I just don't think there's
               time for you to get from the
               reporter to the...

     Right there and then, Laraine does a three second quick
     change from her reporter costume into a flight attendant or
     bunny cocktail waitress.

                         LORNE (CONT'D)
               I stand corrected.

     Lorne pins the final card into the board, he turns to Audrey.

                         AUDREY
               Is that our show?

                         LORNE
               That's our show.

                         JOE DICSO
               Three minutes!

     Lorne turns and bum ps into a TABLE OF HANDGUNS.

                         LORNE
               What the hell is this...?

     Aykroyd picks up a HANDGUN.

                 DANNY                           WALLIE
     Smith and Wesson K-Frame        Hey, you asked...

     Nicely done Wallie.

                         WALLIE
               I asked the stage hands.

                         LORNE
               Don't share anything further...

     Lorne steps over to...

     GEORGE CARLIN'S DRESSING ROOM

     Lorne approaches gingerly. Trying to contain his enthusiasm.

                Hey, George, I just wanted to
                apologize for the way you were
                treated earlier. The buck stops
                with me, and I just wanted you...
                    (frowns)
                What's wrong?

                          GEORGE CARLIN
                Maaaahh-jjjsss-trrrrrk.

                          LORNE
                Jesus, are you having a stroke?

     Carlin points to his jaw, then at some cocaine on the table.

                          LORNE (CONT'D)
                You need more coke?

     Carlin frowns. Points at his mouth again.

                          LORNE (CONT'D)
                    (to the hallway)
                Danny!

     Aykroyd pops in, half dressed. Quickly assesses.

                          AYKROYD
                Lockjaw! Too much coke ceasing up
                the old mandibulars.

     Aykroyd already behind Carlin, grabs his face and begins to
     massage his thumbs into the jaw joint. It's painful.

     Lorne ignores the screams of pain and steps back out almost
     bumping into Michael O'Donoghue. Lost in the moment.

     We follow O'Donoghue back into...

66                                                                 66
     STAGE 8H

     The crew is working like a well oiled machin e! The way the
     stage hands and camera boys move together is a ballet.

     Michael nervously approaches the set, ignoring the audience.
     He takes a seat on stage. The lights really hitting him.
     Painters are drying a fresh coat with hair blow dryers.

                          JOE DICSO
                Two minutes!

     Al and Tom pay him a visit.

decide.                         Saturday Night.

                    TOM DAVIS (CONT'D)
          And what's the first thing they
          see...?



          TOM DAVIS (CONT'D)             AL FRANKEN
No logo, no intro.             Just a close-up of your face.

                    AL FRANKEN (CONT'D)
          But who gives a fuck, right?

                                          AL FRANKEN (CONT'D)
          TOM DAVIS
It's just a bunch of animals    You're going to do great!
watching their lava lamps!

          TOM DAVIS (CONT'D)              AL FRANKEN (CONT'D)
Oh yeah, we can't wait!         We're pulling for you!

Tom and Al wander off laughing as Wally hands a very nervous
O'Donoghue a BOOK and places a PIPE in his mouth.

We turn with Lorne to find the final bricks of home base
going down. He lo oks up, the skylight still swaying.

Billy Preston and his band come to a rousing conclusion.
APPLAUD FROM THE AUDIENCE. It kind of catches our cast and
crew off guard... as they look up and notice THE AUDIENCE!

Gilda comes running out to set, dragging Laraine.

            GILDA                         JOE DICSO
Come on, I want a photo!        There isn't time!

                    GILDA (CONT'D)
          Come on! Family photo! It'll never
          be the same after this! I'm not
          gonna leave un til I get my photo!

                    JOE DICSO
          Fuck - Everyone in! Come on!
                                                            5.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


     The cast (minus Belushi) quickly gathers on the Wolverines
     set by the stairway. Even Lorne gets into the photo.

                          EBERSOL
                I've got a camera!

     Ebersol runs up with the POLAROID CAMERA!

     The actors gather in the classic yearbook formation - CLICK! -
     The Polaroid spits out.

                          JOE DICSO
                Sixty seconds!

     We follow Lorne back out, getting pats on the back from crew.
     He walks by Paul Shaffer and the SNL Band on his w ay out.

67                                                                67
     8TH FLOOR HALLWAY - BROADWAY

     Lorne enters just as Anne walks by with a TRAINER leading a
     LLAMA. Lorne just shakes his head.

68                                                                68
     CONTROL ROOM

     Lorne finds a spot in the now packed room. Ebersol creates a
     small buffer between him and Tebet.

     Commercials are playing back on monitors.

     Cameras are getting focus checks.

     Rosie enters and stands next to Lorne.

                          BARBARA
                Rosie... We need your last name for
                the credits.

                 ROSIE                             LORNE
     Shuster.                         Shuster.

     He chuckles. She takes his hand low where only we can see it.

     Lorne clocks a monitor with Carson still cued up and ready.

                          JOE DICSO (O.C.)
                Thirty Seconds!

     The very last commercial before air starts.

                          DAVE WILSON
                Michael, can we get a sound check?
                                                         4.
                      2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    O'DONOGHUE (O.C.)
          1... 2... uh, 3...

                    DAVE WILSON
              (to the room)
          Someone's got the yips.

                    JOE DICSO (O.C.)
          Twenty Seconds!

                    DAVE WILSON
          George Carlin to his mark. Mr.
          Carlin, can I get a sound check?

                    GEORGE CARLIN (O.C.)
          1, 2, Fuck You.

                    JOE DICSO (O.C.)
          Ten Seconds!

             POOK                         DAVE WILSON
Carson still cued.               Are we going live or going to
                                 tape?

         DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)                 POOK (CONT'D)
Ready camera three...            Pre-Roll VTR 24...

Lorne looks into the engi neering room. They begin pre-roll.

On a PREVIEW MONITOR, the countdown for Carson begins.

                                            DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
          JOE DICSO
Eight... Seven...                 Take Camera three. Ready on
                                  the fade.

Ebersol looks to Tebet.

                                            JOE DICSO (CONT'D)
             POOK
Pre-roll at Six...                Six... Five...

The room turns around. Hands on button. At the ready.

                    JOE DICSO (CONT'D)
          Four... Three...

We push in on Tebet...

                      JOE DICSO (CONT'D)
          Two...

Everyone waiting for the final word... Tebet raises his big
ass jewel encrusted index finger....
                                                                3.
                         2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                          TEBET
                    (quietly)
                Go live.

     BUTTONS ARE QUICKLY PRESSED! ALL SCREENS GO DARK. Everyone
     collectively holds their breath.

                          DAVE WILSON
                And, we, are, live...?

     MONITOR - Fades up on Michael O'Donoghue. Sweating.

               DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)         BARBARA GHALLAGER
     Ready camera one... Push in      Cue Belushi...
     on one...

     Nothing happens.

                          DAVE WILSON (CONT'D)
                    (holding his headset mic)
                Cue John, cue John, cue John...

     Lorne swallows. Eyes darting back and f orth. He's off...

69                                                                   69
     STAGE 8H

     Lorne enters the studio swiftly, gingerly, making it to
     camera. Time stands still. We hear a cough from the audience.

     Rosie, Ebersol, Audrey, follow...

     Lorne keeps getting closer to the stage, watching the
     audience squirm in their seats...

     And then - Click... The set door opens...

     Belushi enters, wearing a wooly earflap hat. He descends the
     stairs and sits across from O'Don oghue.

     Lorne doesn't blink. Cameras move in.

     Belushi using a brilliant foreign unplaceable accent. Perhaps
     one of his Albanian relatives.

                          O'DONOGHUE
                Let us begin. Repeat after me. I
                would like...

                          BELUSHI
                I would like...

                          O'DONOGHUE
                To feed your fingertips...
                                                       2.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                    BELUSHI
          To feed your feengerteeps...

                    O'DONOGHUE
          To the wolverines...

                    BELUSHI
          To the wolver-eenes...

The audience is laughing. Lorne looks around. It's working.
As we listen to the sketch, we continue to move around the
room, gathering every reaction. The writers. The cast
members. The crew, now united, watching the show with pride.
The audience absorbing this bonkers sketch.

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Next - I am afraid. ..

                    BELUSHI
          I em afred...

                    O'DONOGHUE
          We are out...

                    BELUSHI
          We are out...

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Of Badgers...

                    BELUSHI
          Of Badjoors...

                    O'DONOGHUE
          Would you accept...?

                    BELUSHI
          Wood you assept...?

                    O'DONOGHUE
          A wolverine...

                    BELUSHI
          A woolver-eene...

                    O'DONOGHUE
          In it's place...

                    BELUSHI
          Een is plase...

The audience is in fact loving it. As are the crew. Lorne
turns and we watch as everyone in the room is transfixed.
                                                        1.
                    2nd Blue Rev. (5/3/24)


                     O'DONOGHUE
          Next...

O'Donoghue suddenly GASPS. Grabs his heart. Falls out of his
chair on to the ground, feigning a dramatic heart attack.

For a moment, Belushi is puzzled. But he shrugs, clutches his
chest in a perfect imitation, seizes his face and falls to
the ground. Hard.

Huge laughter. Lorne soaks in the sound. Looks around and
back to stage. Again, we move through everybody taking in
this moment ... No one has any idea what they're watching -
the beginning of a revolution.

In the silence, we find an empty piece of wall. Chevy
stumbles into frame, wearing a headset as though a member of
the crew. He surveys the bodies on the floor casually.
Mumbles something into his headset.

Then he looks directly into our camera. Smiles.

                    CHEVY
          Live from New York...
          It's Saturday Night!
