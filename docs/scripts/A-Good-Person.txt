    INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

    THE CAMERA CRESTS an evergreen-covered mountain and DIVES
    down into a picture-perfect small town. It takes a moment
    for our eyes to realize it isn't a real place, but rather
    an incredibly intricate MODEL TRAIN TOWN.

    THE CAMERA FLOATS DOWN MAIN STREET: All of the people are
    happy, frozen forever in a moment of joy and contentment.
    There is order. Routine. A MIL KMAN spilling his bottles
    as a DOG laps up the milk. A COP helping an old lady
    across the street. A YOUNG COUPLE stealing a kiss behind
    the high school. It's a perfect town in a perfect world.

                            DANIEL (V.O.)
              In Herman Eustis' seminal work on
              the joys of being a model train
              hobbyist, he writes: "Many an hour
              have I spent blissfully lost in a
              world of my own creation.

    Reveal DANIEL ADAMS (Morgan Freema n) wearing a magnified
    visor. He's putting the final paint touches on the ELATED
    COUPLE that have just emerged from the CHURCH.

                            DANIEL (V.O.)
              For the model train enthusiast,
              there exists a secret world of
              order and symmetry. Nestled into
              the corners of our basements and
              attics, we lord over a world where
              the hobbyist plays omnipotent
              creator. There, in 1:87 scale, the
              neighbors are always kind, the
              lovers always end up together, and
              the trains always take you to the
              far off places you always swore
              you'd go."

    He lifts his elbows just in time to let the train cars
    pass, then returns to dab one final bead of white on the
    elated bride's veil. WE HEAR THE ECHOEY SOUND OF A WOMAN
    singing The Velvet Underground song "After Hours"
    accompanied by a PIANO.

                            DANIEL (V.O.)
              In life, of course, nothing is
              nearly as neat and tidy.

    INT. ALLISON AND NATHAN'S HOUSE - EVENING

    The SONG continues as THE CAMERA SWIMS through the rooms
    of a packed house party, past a few dozen people
    drinking, smoking weed, flirting, laughing. WE land in
    the living room to reveal the source of the singing.
    ALLISON JOHNSON (26, Florence Pugh) sings at the piano.

                            ALLISON
                    (singing)
              And if you close the door
              The night could last forever
              Leave the sunshine out
              And say hello to never
              All the people are dancing
              And they're having such fun
              I wish it could happen to me
              Cause if you close the door
              I'd never have to see the day
              again
              I'd never have to see the day
              again,
              Once more:

                            EVERYONE
              I'd never have to see the day
              again.

    Allison finishes with an impressive piano flourish and
    everyone drunkenly APPLAUDS and yells "Encore!" Allison
    stands and takes a dramatic bo w.

                            ALLISON
              No, no, no. There will be no
              encore, I'm already way too drunk
              to be playing in front of people.

                            FRIEND
              But we love you!

                            ALLISON
              Yes, and I want it to stay that
              way! That was for my dear, sweet
              fiancï¿½, Nathan. Who loves that
              song very much. Come up here,
              baby. He's very shy. Get up here.

    NATHAN (30, African American) waves her off from the back
    of the room. Friends hoot and holler for him to j oin her.

                            EVERYONE
              Nathan, Nathan...
                                                         3.


He weaves his way up to the front to applause. Allison
stands and kisses him. (We notice that Nathan wears a
hearing aid in his right ear.)

                        NATHAN
          Hey, y'all. I'll just briefly say
          that she played that song for me
          on our very first date on a beat-
          up, old piano she found in the
          back of an empty bar.

                        MOLLY
          Well, you better go, girl!

Laughter. We notice a couple snuggled-up on the couch
we'll come to kn ow as Nathan's sister, MOLLY (35, African
American), and her husband, JESSE (38, African American).

                        ALLISON
          Always be closing.

                        MOLLY
          Absolutely. Welcome to the family.

                        NATHAN
          Allison, every memory I cherish in
          my life has you in it. Some of
          them are just tiny seconds: the
          way you close one eye when you
          really wanna focus on tasting
          something.

                        ALLISON
               (to everyone)
          I do that. I do that.

                        NATHAN
          I can't believe this is real?

                        ALLISON
          This is real, baby.

                        NATHAN
          Thank God. I love you.

They kiss. The room cheers!

                        NATHAN (CONT'D)
          OK. Enough. Drink, smoke, be
          merry. And if you choose to sleep
          with Chip, make sure he wears,
          like, eleven condoms.

The WOMAN on Chip's arm looks at him like WTF...
                                                          4.


                            CHIP
              OK, I'm literally a virgin.

    The room erupts with laughter. They kiss.

    INT. ALLISON AND NATHAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

    Allison lies on her stomach on the bed reading her phone
    in a t-shirt and underwear. Nathan enters in boxers.

                            NATHAN
              No. C'mon, baby. No phone. When we
              get married we have to make a rule
              about phones in bed.

                            ALLISON
              Oh shut up, you're on your phone
              ten times more than me, looking at
              rusted old trucks.

                            NATHAN
                   (gasping)
              A `67 cloth-top Bronco is a work
              of art, baby, not a truck. I am
              looking at art. Like this butt.

    He climbs on top of her and kisses her ass cheeks.

                            ALLISON
              You got me so high with that weed
              gummy. What the fuck was that? I
              still can't feel my ankles.

                            NATHAN
              You don't need your ankles right
              now.

                            ALLISON
              Yeah, but I'd still like to be
              able to feel them.

    They both laugh.

                            NATHAN
              Hey, come kiss me.

                            ALLISON
              Ugh. This creepy doctor on my
              sales list is seriously trying to
              flirt with me on Instagram.
                                                    5.


                        NATHAN
          Maybe you gave him the wrong
          impression.

                        ALLISON
          Yeah, right. I walk in there
          waving my engagement ring around.

                        NATHAN
          You always say flirting is part of
          the job. Someone's bound to get
          the wrong impression.

                        ALLISON
          It's very light flirting.

                        NATHAN
          Oh, OK.

                         ALLISON
          It is! It's just sushi and a smile
          so they'll write the fucking
          prescription and I can get a fat
          bonus and you and I can one day
          move to t he city.

                        NATHAN
          If we don't go to hell first.

                        ALLISON
          Why would you say that? I'm just
          pushing Humira. I'm not gonna go
          to hell for "moderate to severe
          psoriasis." C'mon, that would be
          so unfair.

                        NATHAN
          It's just a stepping stone, baby.

                        ALLISON
          Is it too late to go to astronaut
          school?

They both laugh.

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          I could be a professional dancer.

                        NATHAN
          Oh, word. You got the moves?

She does a silly head/arm s himmy. They crack up.
                                                            6.


                               ALLISON
                 Wait. Let me stand up. I'm way
                 better when I stand up.

    She stands on the bed and begins to dance ridiculously.

                               NATHAN
                 What genre is this?

                               ALLISON
                 I don't know, but my body just
                 knows.

                               NATHAN
                 This is modern, right?

                               ALLISON
                 This is professional, so I would
                 appreciate if you took me
                 seriously right now.

                               NATHAN
                 I'm taking you very seriously.

                               ALLISON
                 And then, I'd finish with
                 something like this. But I'm not
                 going to show you anymore because
                 it's a work in progress.

    She wrestles him until she's on top. She pulls the white
    sheet over the top of them. UNDER:

                               ALLISON (CONT'D)
                 The professional is tired. And I
                 want to cuddle.

    They kiss.

                                             A LOUD TRUCK HONKS!

    INT. ALLISON'S CAR - DAY

    Allison drives on a busy freeway with the couple we saw
    at the party: Nathan's sister, Molly, in the front seat
    and Molly's husband, Jes se, in the back.

                               ALLISON
                      (to trucker)
                 Oh, calm the fuck down! I swear to
                 God this road has been under
                 construction my entire life. When
                 is New Jersey gonna be done?
                                                      7.


                        JESSE
          She's a work in progress.

                        ALLISON
          How's Ryan doing?

                        JESSE
          Oh, you mean your future niece?

Jesse leans forward and shows Allison his lock screen: a
beautiful picture of a smiling RYAN (15) in a soccer
uniform.

                        ALLISON
          Awww. So pretty!

                        JESSE
          The varsity coach said she might
          start next year.

                        MOLLY
          She had 19 goals last season!

                        ALLISON
          Wow! You guys must be so proud. I
          can't believe I still haven't met
          her. I'm so sorry Nathan and I
          haven't made it down yet.

                        MOLLY
          Yeah, it's far. We're trying to
          come up more now that our Dad is
          getting older.

                        ALLISON
          Well, I've only met your Dad a few
          times now, but that we can't blame
          on distance.

Traffic has slowed to a standstill as CONSTRUCTION
VEHICLES block the road.

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          This is just fucking nuts. I'm so
          sorry.

                        MOLLY
          Sooooo, tell us about these
          wedding dresses w e're seeing.

                        JESSE
          Yes, please. I couldn't sleep last
          night thinking about it.
                                                             8.


    They laugh.

                               ALLISON
                 You are such a good sport.

                               MOLLY
                 No, he's not. He just thinks after
                 seeing your dresses we're gonna do
                 a pub crawl, but we're actually
                 going to see a play.

                               JESSE
                 No, we're not. You woulda had to
                 get tickets already.

                               MOLLY
                 Oh, we just have to see some shit
                 no one else wants to see.

                               JESSE
                 Oh great, that sounds awesome.
                 Hey, look, it's finally opening
                 up.

    Traffic is moving again as the CONS TRUCTION VEHICLES have
    moved out of the way.

                               ALLISON
                 OK, it might be a little tight
                 getting you to a play, let me
                 check the traffic again.

    Allie looks down at her phone. She opens the MAPS app:

                               ALLISON (CONT'D)
                 OK, so MAPS is saying...

    A CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE backs onto the highway.

                 JESSE                             MOLLY
    HOLY SHIT!                      ALLIE!

    THEY COLLECTIVELY SCREAM IN TERROR AS ALLISON SLAMS ON
    THE BRAKES!

                                              HARD CUT TO BLACK.

    INT. DANIEL'S CAR - DA Y

    Daniel and RYAN (15, African American) pull up in front
    of her school and park. She plays a game on her phone.
                                                         9.


                         DANIEL
          Here we are.

                        RYAN
          You got me here so early.

                        DANIEL
          It's better to be a half-hour
          early, than one minute late.

                        RYAN
          Grandpa have you ever played any
          video games?

                        DANIEL
          No. You got this perfect little
          brain up there, and you're just
          melting it away with that crap.

His CELL PHONE rings. Ryan sees the caller ID.

                        RYAN
          It's Uncle Nathan. Answer it.

                        DANIEL
          Why would he be calling me?

                         RYAN
          Pick up.

Daniel answers and puts the phone to his ear.

                        DANIEL
          I thought you weren't talking to
          me anymore.

Daniel listens. We see his face slowly drop. The color
drains from his cheeks. All we hear are the SOUNDS and
MUSIC coming from Ryan's game on her phone. His eyes
well. He looks at her.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Uh, listen. Nathan. I've got Ryan
          here. I'm just dropping her off at
          school. Let me call you back in a
          bit.
               (he listens)
          Yes, I did hear what you've said.
          I'll head right there. I just
          gotta drop her off.

He hangs up. He's in shock; barely able to breath.
                                                         10.


                            RYAN
              See that wasn't so bad. Mom says
              she wishes you guys could find a
              way to get along.

                            DANIEL
              I've got to go now, sweetie.

                            RYAN
              Ugh. I look like such a dork being
              here this early.

    His mind races.

                            DANIEL
              I'm gonna pick you up today
              sweetie.

                            RYAN
              Why can't Mom? She said they'd be
              back from the city today, right?

                            DANIEL
              Well, she can't.

                            RYAN
              I'll text her. OK. Bye.

                            DANIEL
              Tell me you love me.

                            RYAN
              I love you, Grandp a.

    She kisses him on the cheek and slams the door. The
    second she's out of sight he takes a deep gasp of air as
    though he'd been holding his breath the entire time.

    INT. HOSPITAL ICU - DAY

    DIANE (52, Allison's mother) and Nathan stand on either
    side of Allison's bed in a small ICU room. Her head is
    bandaged.

                            ALLISON
              My head, Mom. I just can't explain
              to you how much pain I have in my
              head.

                             DIANE
              Clic k on the morphine again.
                                               11.


                        ALLISON
          I clicked it. I keep clicking it.
          It doesn't do anything.

                        DIANE
          Oh, shoot, you're right. We have
          to get more.

                        ALLISON
          Nathan, why are you looking at me
          like that?

                        NATHAN
          Like what?

                        ALLISON
          Is it bad?

                        DIANE
          He's just upset, baby. We've been
          so worried all night long.

                        ALLISON
          This backhoe thing just reversed
          into the middle of the street. I
          didn't know what to do.

                        DIANE
          I'm sure. Don't worry about that
          right now. Right, Nathan?

                        NATHAN
          Yeah.

                        DIANE
          You just need to focus on getting
          better. That's all you should be
          worried about right now. Right,
          Nathan?

                        NATHAN
          Yeah.

A NURSE enters with a STATE TROOPER.

                        ICU NURSE
          I'm sorry to interrupt, but the
          police are here to collect a blood
          sample.

                        DIANE
          Now is not a good time, she's in a
          lot of pain.
                                                       12.


          ALLISON                          NATHAN
Why are the police here?        You have to come back, she
                                just woke up.

                        POLICEMAN
          Unfortunately, I can't. Legally
          the sample has to be drawn as soon
          as possible. We waited for her to
          stabilize, but with an accident
          like this, it's imperative we test-

                        ALLISON
          What is he talking about? It
          wasn't my fault.

           NATHAN                          DIANE
Officer, she doesn't...         It wasn't her fault.

                        POLICEMAN
          With an accident of this magni tude
          involving fatalities, we're
          required...

                        NATHAN
          She hasn't been told.

                            ALLISON
          Fatalities?

                        DIANE
          She hasn't been told! You fucking
          asshole. She didn't know.

                        ALLISON
          Mom? What's going on?

                           POLICEMAN
          I'm so sorry.

                        ALLISON
          Nathan. What's going on?

                        NATHAN
          They're gone. They're both gone.

                          ALLISON
          Who's gone?

The CAMERA retreats until it's outside the glass of the
room. We cannot hear what's being said, but we see that
Diane is calmly telling Allison about the death of Molly
and Jesse. A man's shoulder arrives in the foreground;
watching. We see Allison digest the words.
                                                           13.


    WE CUT TO THE REVERSE ANGLE INSIDE THE ROOM. The shoulder
    is Daniel's staring at them all in a stupor through the
    glass. He looks grey and lost.

                                              HARD CUT TO BLACK.

                            INFLUENCER (O.S.)
              Hey, guys. Bella here. Welcome to
              my bathroom. Today we're gonna
              learn to cut our own hair! So
              let's jump in. OK, so grab that
              first front layer just like I'm
              doing and hold your scissors on a
              slight angle just like this?

    THE CAMERA PANS past lots of beauty products an d lands on
    an iPHONE. It plays a YOUTUBE VIDEO of a TEENAGE
    INFLUENCER demonstrating how to cut your own hair.

    REVEAL Allison in the mirror. She looks pale and
    medicated as she holds scissors to a large chunk of her
    hair.

                            INFLUENCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
              OK, it's now or never. Hahah. Go
              for it!

    She hacks off a giant amount of hair. She checks the
    mirror.

                             ALLISON
              Fuck.

                            INFLUENCER (O.S.)
              You nailed it! You're officially a
              stylist just like me! Now go ahead
              and grab that same layer on the
              other side. And go for it!

                               ALLISON
              Okay.
                                                          14.


    Allison does the same thing to the other side.

                            ALLISON (CONT'D)
              Fuck.

                            INFLUENCER (O.S.)
              Does it look even?

                            ALLISON
              Not really.

                            INFLUENCER
              Good job. You look amazing!

                            ALLISON
              Thank you.

    We JUMP CUT through MORE ANGLES of Allison chopping
    different areas of her hair.

                            ALLISON (CONT'D)
              Wow, I love it.

    Allison, sporting a truly fucked up new haircut, paints
    her toenails as she watches TV.

    Di ane enters from work wearing a blue polo and matching
    slacks, a uniform of some kind. She kicks lots of small
    brown boxes over the threshold.

                            DIANE
              Allie! What the hell is all of
              this? You have got to stop buying
              all this crap. You promised me you
              were gonna...

                             ALLISON
              Well one of them is a do-it-
              yourself acrylic nail set that I'm
              sure you're gonna appreciate more
              than me. And the other ones are
              ankl e weights, remember when we
              said we were gonna get in shape?

    She notices her hair.

                            DIANE
              Oh my God. Allison! What the hell
              did you do to your hair?
                                                     15.


                        ALLISON
          It's makeover Monday.

                         DIANE
          It's Friday.

                         ALLISON
          Oh.

                        DIANE
          It's so dark in here.

She opens all the curtains. Allie squints and covers her
eyes with her hand. Dust in the air.

                        ALLISON
          No, please, don't open that.
          That's so bright.

                        DIANE
          Did you go to physical therapy?

                        ALLISON
          Well, I tried, but I overslept.

                         DIANE
          Allie.

                        ALLISON
          What? I don't need PT.

                        DIANE
          Allie, your hair.

She comes over and runs her han ds through it.

                        ALLISON
          You don't like it?

                        DIANE
          I just don't understand why you
          would cut your own hair.

                        ALLISON
          The girl said it was easy. It's
          not.

                         DIANE
          What girl?

                        ALLISON
          A girl on Youtube. She's an
          influencer. She influenced me.
                                                   16.


Diane picks up dirty dishes.

                        DIANE
          It's such a pigsty in here. I'm
          not happy about this.

                        ALLISON
          Hey, mamma, can you tell me where
          my pills are?

                          DIANE
          Which ones?

                          ALLISON
          Ha.

                        DIANE
          We said we were gonna wean off of
          those.

                        ALLISON
          Did "we"? Well, "we" are in pain.
          So "we" need more.

                        DIANE
          They're not gonna give you
          anymore.

                          ALLISON
          They have to.

                        DIANE
          No, they do not.

                          ALLISON
          I need them.

Diane sits down on the ottoma n opposite Allie.

                        DIANE
          Listen to me. You're not in any
          physical pain anymore. Have you
          been doing that tapping thing that
          one shrink taught you? Remember,
          for anxiety and stress and it
          calms you down? On the eyes, then
          the lips...

Diane demonstrates by tapping on her cheek bone.

                        DIANE (CONT'D)
          Or play your piano. That always
          cheered you up...
                                     17.


              ALLISON
Please don't do this right now; I
have the worst headache. Can you
call the doctors and help me
please?

              DIANE
Which one, Patel? He said no more.

              ALLISON
Fuck Patel. Try Goldberg or Fong.

             DIANE
Allie...

              ALLISON
Please, mom. Just call them. Just
help me please?

              DIANE
Guess what? They've all said no
more. Patel. Goldberg. Fong.
Rosenberg.

              ALLISON
I'll try Vromen. He loves me.

              DIANE
He's an orthodontist.

              ALLISON
Yeah, but he used to flirt with me
while his fingers were in my
mouth. Very inappropriate; he owes
me.

              DIANE
Enough is enough. You got to get
out of this living room, take off
your pajamas, and go get a job.
I'm sick of this crap.

              ALLISON
Like you have any right to lecture
me about medicating yourself.

              DIANE
What is that supposed to mean?

              ALLISON
It means, mom, you're such a
fucking hypocrite. You don't think
I clock how many Xanax you're
taking every night?

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               Or how many glasses of wine? I
               know you think I'm just a zombie
               who doesn't notice anything, but I
               see exactly what's going on with
               you. So can I have my pills
               please?

                             DIANE
               You're not listening to me.
               They're all gone.

     Allison gets up and charges upstairs. Diane follows.

               You get right ba ck here, you
               little brat. What the hell do you
               think you're doing?! Get out of
               here!

     Diane tries to physically stop her from riffling through
     her drawers, but Allison is on a mission.

                             ALLISON
               Get off me!

                             DIANE
               Look at yourself! What the hell is
               the matter with you?!

                             ALLISON
               You are hurting me!

                             DIANE
               Stop it!

     She finds a canister of Oxy. Diane slams the bathroom
     door to keep her from escaping.


                             ALLISON
               Open the door.

                             DIANE
               No.

                             ALLISON
               Mom, open the fucking door and let
               me out.
                                                             19.


                             DIANE
               No. Enough. I'm sick and tired of
               this.

                             ALLISON
               Let me the fuck out!

                             DIANE
               No!

     Diane grabs the canister from Allie. They wrestle and
     knock things all over the place. Allie's elbow SHATTERS
     THE GLASS IN THE CLOSET DOOR. Diane manages to get the
     canister open and pour all of the pills into the toilet
     bowl. Allison SCREAMS and gets on her knees to try to
     start fishing them out, but Diane flushes the toilet.

     INSERT: All of the little pills swirl down the drain.

                             ALLISON
               Why the fuck did you do that?! I'm
               in pain. Your daughter is in
               actual pain.

                             DIANE
               I don't give a shit!

                             ALLISON
               I fucking hate you so much.

                             DIANE
               You're bleeding.


     Allison runs out of the bathroom. Diane chases her.

     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Allie runs down the stairs and out the front door. Her
     elbow is bleeding.

                             D IANE
               You come back here right now.

                             ALLISON
               Leave me the fuck alone.

                             DIANE
               I'm not going to leave you alone,
               you little brat.

     Allie hops on a BMX bicycle and rides off.

                             DIANE
               Allison!

                             ALLISON
               Leave me alone.

                             DIANE
               Where are you going?!

                             ALLISON
               Leave me alone!

13                                                               13
     EXT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL - SOCCER FIELD - DAY

     Ryan (now 16) appears hardened after a year of grieving
     the loss of her two parents. Daniel sits in the stands.

                             DANIEL
               Let's go Ryan!!!

     Ryan dribbles down the field, weaving around lots of
     other girls . She attempts to score, but she kicks it far
     off to the side.

                             RYAN
               Fuck.

     GABRIELLA (16, Hispanic) jogs up alongside her.

                             GABRIELLA
               So you're the Ryan who's been
               talking to Damien?

                             RYAN
               Get the fuck outta my face.

                             GABRIELLA
               See, you talk to people like that,
               bitch, that's why you have no
               friends.

                             RYAN
               Then why are you hitting on me.

                             GABRIELLA
               I ain't the one named "Ryan."
               That's a fucking dyke's name. You
               a dyke?
                                                     21.


                        RYAN
          Only when I fuck your mother.

                        GABRIELLA
          At least I have a mother.

That stops Ryan dead in her tracks. She turns and gets
right in the Gabriella's face.

                        RYAN
          What the fuck did you just say?

Gabriella SHOVES her.

                         DANIEL
                 (from sideline)
          Hey!

                        GABRIELLA
          Stay away from Damien, you fucking
          whore.

Gabriella SPITS in Ryan's face.

                        DANIEL
          Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
          Ref! Break it up!

Ryan throws a huge punch to her face, but Gabriella
dodges it and lands a KNOCKOUT BLOW to Ryan's left eye.
Ryan goes down to the ground. Daniel leaps to his feet
and runs onto the field. It's chaos as the coaches and
parents try to stop other girls from fighting. WHISTLES
BLOWING.

Daniel makes it to Ryan who starts walking off the field.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          What the hell was that? What are
          you doing?

                        RYAN
          I quit. I hate this fucking game.

                        DANIEL
          Cause you got in a fight? That's
          not you, Ryan. You're tough.
          You're not a quitter.

Tears start flowing down her face. She stops and turns
back to him.

                        RYAN
          She made fun of Mom.
                                                            22.


                             DANIEL
               What?

                             RYAN
               She said, `At least I have a mom.'

                             DANIEL
               Well, then fuck her.

     Daniel puts his arm around Ryan as they walk off.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               And what kind of punch was that,
               by the way? You threw a hard right-
               hook, but then you left yourself
               completely open for a jab. We're
               gonna need to work on that.

14                                                                14
     EXT. PHARMACY - LATER

     Allie rides her bike up to the pharmacy and drops it
     outside the door.

15                                                                15
     INT. PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER

     Allie, in her robe and sweats, bites her nails waiting to
     talk to the female PHARMACIST. She steps up to the
     counter and puts on a big, fake smile.

                             ALLISON
               Hi, I need to get a prescription
               refilled. Last name is Johnson.
               Birthday is 8/24.

                             PHARMACIST
               OK. For which medication?

                             ALLISON
               Uh... the Oxy. Oxycontin.

     The Pharmacist types away on her keyboard.

                             PHARMACIST
               It says here that you're ou t of
               refills. I see that you've been on
               them for over a year now. Your
               doctor may be trying to wean you
               off of them. As I'm sure you know,
               they can be very addictive.
                                                             23.


                             ALLISON
               Oh, really? I hadn't fucking heard
               that.

     The Pharmacist stares at her. Allie tries to buy it back.

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry. Look, I was in a really
               bad car accident and I need them
               for pain.

                             PHARMACIST
               Just now?

                             ALLISON
               No! What?

                             PHARMACIST
               Your elbow is bleeding.

                             ALLISON
               It's fine.

                             PHARMACIST
               Let me get you a bandage.

                             ALLISON
               I don't need a fucking bandage.
               It's fine.

                             PHARMACIST
               Then take this.

     She hands her a PAMPHLET on opioid addiction.

                             ALLISON
               Yeah. This is exactly what I need.
               Thank you so much.

     Allison take the pamphlet and holds it on her bloody
     elbow like a bandage.

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               Thank you! It feels so much better
               already! Bitch.

     Allie storms down the aisle, stealing a package of "Hello
     Kitty" barrettes on her way out.

     Allie rifles under the sink. She opens empty canister
     after canister; tossing them on the floor. There's dozens
     of them. She sits down on the floor and notices a
     wrinkled picture on the cabinet shelf. She takes it out.

     INSERT PHOTO: Allison and Nathan making multiple silly
     faces in a black-and-white photo booth.

     She looks over to see a bottle of COLD MEDICINE under the
     sink. She grabs it and chugs half the bottle. She closes
     her eyes and waits for it to kick in.

     Allie snaps out of her nightmare. She's drenched in
     sweat; still on the bathroom floor.

     INT. POSH RESTAURANT - MORNING

     Breakfast at a white-tablecloth restaurant. Allie enters
     and waves to her friend, BECKA.

                              BECKA
               Hey!

                              ALLISON
               Hi.

                             BECKA
               Oh my God, I love your hair! It's
               so chic. Who did it?

                             ALLISON
               Oh... I have a new gal.

     They hug and sit.
                                               25.


                        BECKA
          I was so happy to hear from you
          cause you haven't replied to any
          of my texts. I mean, of course I
          wanted to give you your space, but
          I've been worried.

A WAITER approaches.

                        WAITER
          Hi, good morning. Can I get you
          anything?

                        ALLISON
          Can I please get a Jack and Coke?

                        WAITER
          Uh... Our bar doesn't actually
          open until 11.

                        ALLISON
          Oh, uh, yeah, ok. Just black
          coffee then.

                        BECKA
          Oat milk latte, please.

                         ALLISON
          So , how's work? You're still at
          Purdue, right?

                        BECKA
          Yup, still repping Purdue. You'd
          think it woulda been a shit-show
          since the bankruptcy and all the
          lawsuits. But, between you and me,
          my sales have actually increased.
          My bonus was insane last quarter.

                        ALLISON
          It sells itself.

                         BECKA
          Yeah, Karl Marx was wrong. It
          turns out the opiate of the
          masses... is opium.
               (beat)
          Anyway. How are you doing? When
          are yo u gonna go back to work?

                        ALLISON
          Listen, I'm gonna cut right to it
          cause you're my friend, and I know
          you'll get it.

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          I'm still in a lot of pain, and my
          docs are cutting off my Oxy scrips
          cause everyone is so freaked out
          about addiction these days. And I
          was wondering...

                        BECKA
          Allie, please tell me you didn't
          ask me to breakfast to hit me up
          for pills.

                        ALLISON
          It's just until I can get in to
          see my docs. My fucking mother
          flushed my last refill down the
          toilet.

                        BECKA
          No way. Are you fucking with me
          right now? If you ha ve a problem,
          you should get help. I can help
          you find a rehab.

                        ALLISON
          Please don't hand me a pamphlet,
          I've already got one.

                        BECKA
               (whispers)
          Well, then find them on the street
          if you have to. Every bar in
          town's got a guy with a pharmacy
          in his front pocket.

                        ALLISON
          You know, Becka... I didn't really
          want it to come to this, but there
          were a handful of things that
          happened at your bachelorette
          party that I have a feeling you'd

Becka turns white.

                        BECKA
          Allison, are you trying to
          blackmail me for Oxycontin?

                        ALLISON
          I'm just asking for your help...
          as a friend.
               (beat)
          But you did blow that dancer.

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               I know it was only for a second.
               But you did. I saw it.

                             BECKA
               It never went in my mouth.

                             ALLISON
               It was in your mouth. Past the
               tip.
                    (beat)
               Past the fucking tip.

     Becka stands up sending silverware CLANKING.

                             BECKA
               You need help, Allie. Destroy my
               life if you need to. But for the
               love of God, get some fucking
               help.

                             ALLISON
               OK. Bye. Fuck you.

                             BECKA
               Fuck you!

     She speeds off as the waiter brings Allie her coffee.

                             ALLISON
               I don't have any money, so...
               forget it.

                             WAITER
               It's OK. Take it.
                    (whispers)
               I put some tequila in it.

     Allie looks confused, then takes a sip.

                             ALLISON
               That's disgusting. But thank you.

     INT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

     Daniel sits with his hat in his lap in a chair outside an
     office door in an empty hallway. The door opens, SANDRA
     KEEN (Ryan's Guidance Counselor) steps out.
                                                            28.

     INT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

     Daniel and Sandra sit with ALBERTO REYES (Principal of
     the School).

                             SANDRA
               Thank you for coming in. We met
               briefly when you first registered
               Ryan.

                             DANIEL
               Yeah. You played soccer at
               Rutgers.

                             SANDRA
               Yes! Good memory.

                             DANIEL
               Not really. I just like to root
               for Jersey.

                             SANDRA
               OK, this is our principal, Alberto
               Reyes.

                              DANIEL
               Oh. I don't think I've met a
               princi pal since I was in high
               school myself. I already feel like
               I'm in trouble.

                             Albert
               No, no. Mr. Adams. Not at all.
               We're happy you're here. Please
               have a seat.

                             DANIEL
               OK, so what did Ryan do now?

                             Sandra
               Ryan is very smart, Mr. Adams. And
               she's an incredible athlete, as
               you know. But she's having a very
               hard time assimilating into any
               peer groups here. She's also very
               often hostile to her teachers, and
               of course, there was the fight on
               the field the other day.

                             DANIEL
               Well, now that girl said some
               horrible things to her about her
               mother.
                                                          29.


                             Albert
               Look, we really have been as
               patient and empathetic as we
               possibly can knowing the tragedy
               that occurred and how she must be
               grieving.

                             DANIEL
               You know, it's a whole lot
               different even from when I raised
               my kids. These phones and the shit
               they see on the internet... Sorry,
               I'm cursing in front of the
               principal.

                             SANDRA
               Mr. Adams, we want to do
               everything we can to help Ryan.
               But she has to take s ome
               responsibility for her behavior.

                             DANIEL
               That child doesn't listen to a
               word I say. To be honest, I was
               hoping you were calling me in to
               give me some advice. I need help.

                             ALBERT
               It's just that we're a public
               school. We have 2000 kids to look
               after. We just don't have the
               bandwidth to micromanage her in a
               way she needs and deserves.

                             DANIEL
               What are you saying?

                             ALBERT
               I'm gonna give her an extra strike
               because of the circumstances. But
               if she doesn't tone down her
               language with her teachers or gets
               in one more fight, we're gonna
               have to expel her.

     This lands heavy on Daniel.

     INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

     Allie sits down at the sticky bar. This place is gross;
     you can smell it just by seeing it. A FEW GUYS watch a
     horse race on TV. A SCARY GUY plays pinball.
                                                     30.


                        ALLISON
          Double tequila, neat.

Allie looks down the bar and sees two guys she recognizes
from high school: MARK (27) and DIEGO (28). She quickly
looks away and down at her watch, a men's Rolex.

                        MARK
          Allison. Yo. I know you. It's
          Mark.

                        ALLISON
          Yeah. Hey.

                        MARK
          Yeah. I haven't seen you since
          high school. You remember Diego?

                        ALLISON
          Hey.

                        DIEGO
          Hey.

                        MARK
          Just having a lil breakfast?

                        ALLISON
          Oh. Yeah. Had to get outta the
          house.

                        MARK
          Yeah, I feel that.

                        DIEGO
          Hey, I heard what happened to you.
          The accident. Saw it in the Star
          Ledger. Sorry.

                        MARK
          What happened?

                        DIEGO
          She was in that accident on the
          turnpike. Two people died.

                        MARK
          Holy shit. That was you. Bro, that
          would've fucked me up.

                        ALLISON
          It wasn't my fault.
                                                     31.


                        MARK
          I'm sure, but still.

Allie shoots down her whole drink. The DINGS and BELLS
from the pinball machine punctuate their conversation.

                        ALLISON
          Can I have another please?

                        MARK
          You having a tough day?

                        ALLISON
          Just a day. I just wish I could go
          as far away from here as possible.

                        DIEGO
          There's this app, it tells you the
          exact opposite of where you are on
          the globe is. That's where you
          should go. I'll look it up for
          you.

The BARTENDER pours her another double tequila. She downs
it. DING. BELL. Diego searches the app in his phone.

                        MARK
          That's how I feel every fucking
          day of my life. But I can't seem
          to escape this town. It's like
          there's a force field around it.
          Some people know how to get out.
          The rest of us just keep bumping
          our heads against the glass.

                         DIEGO
          It's Perth. That's the city on the
          opposite o f the globe from here.
          You should go to Perth.

                        ALLISON
          I don't have any money to get to
          Perth. But thank you.

                        DIEGO
          Aren't you engaged to Nathan
          Adams?

                        ALLISON
          I was.
                                     32.


              DIEGO
He was an amazing running back in
high school. He ran every fucking
play. You remember him, Mark?

              MARK
Yeah.

              DIEGO
Every fucking play, they'd come
over the PA like: "Nathan Adams
the ball carrier. Nathan Adams the
ball carrier." He was the whole
fucking team. Remember that, Mark?

              MARK
Yeah. I remember him.

              DIEGO
Isn't he deaf?

              ALLISON
Just in one ear. Since birth.

               DIEGO
Wow. That's impressive. That he
co uld be, like, that good, you
know. And half deaf.

              ALLISON
Yup.

              DIEGO
So you're, like, single?

              MARK
Dude, shut the fuck up. You think
she wants to date you? Where you
going to take her? You live with
your mom. Goddamn. I'm sorry,
Allison. My fucking friend has no
tact at all. We're not used to
having pretty girls such as
yourself coming in here, so please
excuse his lack of decor.

             ALLISON
Decorum.

             MARK
What?
                                                     33.


                        ALLISON
          Decor is the Budweiser lamp above
          your head. Decorum is his
          behavior. Neither is currently
          ideal.

          Can I ask you guys something? Like
          between us? Old friends...

                        DIEGO
          You weren't our friend. You were
          popular. You were a bitch.

                         MARK
          That's old shit. Right, Allison?
          We're all grown up now. Those of
          us stuck behi nd that force

          We don't fuck with pills.

                        Allison
          I'm not saying you do, but
          something tells me one of you
          knows how one could get Oxy.

          I remember in high school that you
          were the guys who could get
          anything.

                        MARK
          Now you're just buttering us up.

                        ALLISON
          I don't have any money.

                        DIEGO
          How are you gonna pay for that
          tequila?

                        ALLISON
          I hadn't gotten that far.

                        DIEGO
          Is that Rolex real?

Allie covers the watch with her other hand.

          Wait. Ms. Allie Johnson, you just
          stroll in here you got no money,
          and you expect us to get you Oxy
          for f ree. And then you want us to
          pay for your drink. Now why the
          hell would we do that?

          You thought you were such hot shit
          in high school. You're no

                        MARK
          Shut up. Sorry. No decorum.

          He's right.
               (beat)
          I didn't think I was better than
          you, I knew it. I looked down on
          guys like you and thought you were
          Jersey trash who'd never be able
          to get out of town. Oops.

          A favor.

          The favor is a fix. You're a

          I thought you were the nice one.

                        MARK
          You want us to take care of you?
          Why don't you say it? Say "I'm a
          fucking junkie" and I'll get you
          whatever you want. Anything. Say
          it. Just come out with it.
                                                     36.


                        ALLISON
          I'm asking for a favor. I'll owe
          you one.

                        MARK
          You know who never has any money,
          Allie Johnson?

                        ALLISON
          Who?

                        MARK
          Junkies. Tell me you're a fucking
          junkie, and I'll get you whatever
          you need.

                        ALLISON
          I'm currently a bit reliant...

                        MARK
          No, that's not what I fucking
          said. You sneaky little bitch,
          that's not what I fucking said.
               (to Diego)
          Is that what I said?

                        DIEGO
          No.

                         MARK
          That is not what I said. Say
          yo u're a fucking junkie. Look at
          me...

Her giant eyes fill. Mark SLAMS his hand on the bar to
get her attention.

                        MARK (CONT'D)
          Look at me! Look me in the eyes
          and say, "I'm a fucking junkie."

                        DIEGO
          Say it.

                        ALLISON
          I'm a fucking junkie.

          Beth, I got these tequilas. I'm
          sorry for raising my voice. Were
          just catching up. Allie, this is
          Beth. She's divine.

     EXT. DIVE BAR - BACK DOOR - LATER

     Mark and Diego pack a glass pipe.

                             ALLISON
               That's not Oxy.

                             MARK
               Same exact shit.

     Mark smokes the heroin through a glass pipe off of a
     piece of tinfoil and passes it to Allie. She smokes it.

     INT. DIVE BAR - BACK STAIRS - LATER

     Allie's asleep on the dirty back stairs of the bar. She
     wakes up and vomits.

27                                                                27
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Allison en ters through the back door looking nauseous in
     her wrinkled business suit to find a distraught Diane.
     She's on the phone and chain-smoking.

                             DIANE
                    (into phone)
               She just walked in.

     She hangs up and runs to hug Allison.

                             DIANE (CONT'D)
               Oh my God. Where have you been? I
               was so worried.

                             ALLISON
               I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I need
               help.

                             DIANE
               Oh, baby. I never should have
               flushed those pills down the
               toilet. I had no right. I'm so
               sorry. I'm just so worried about
               you.

                             ALLISON
               Can you help me please, mamma?
                                                             38.


                             DIANE
               I already did. Here...

     She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a canister.

                             DIANE (CONT'D)
               I got these from Linda, the gal
               that runs the toy kiosk next to me
               at the mall. They gave them to her
               after she got punched by a shop-
               lifter, but she never needed them.
               She just swears by her neck brace.
               Not like you, baby. You need them.
               So here, these are from Linda.

     She places them in Allison's hand and closes her fingers.

                             DIANE (CONT'D)
               We'll tackle beating it later.
               Let's not rush it. What's most
               important is that you're home
               safe.

     Allie looks down at them in her hand.

28                                                                 28
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Allison sits on the floor in front of Diane on the couch,
     high on Oxy. Diane wields scissors, cleaning up the
     haircut.

                             DIANE
               You know, I used to cut my
               grandmother's hair.

                             ALLISON
               Well, don't make me look like her.

                             DIANE
               Oh, stop it. Granny Annie was
               beautiful. Skin like a porcelain
               doll until the day she died. I was
               just a little girl. I couldn't
               believe she was letting me cut her
               hair. I felt so special.

                             ALLISON
               She probably just wanted to be
               with you.

     INSERT: THE SCAR FROM THE ACCIDENT on the back of Allie's
     head. Diane gently runs her fingers across it.
                                                            39.


                             DIANE
               Yeah, you're probably right. I
               liked to think it's cause I was so
               good at it, but I was only seven,
               so...

                             ALLISON
               Oh my God, mom. You've been
               telling me you cut hair my whole
               life, you never told me you were
               seven.

     They both share a hearty laugh. A release.

                             DIANE
               What can I say? I was a prodigy.
               They say Mozart wrote his best
               shit before puberty.

     They CRACK UP.

29                                                                29
     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AF TERNOON

     Daniel returns home carrying Chinese food.

                             DANIEL
               Ryan?

     As he walks in the house, MUSIC coming from upstairs
     THUMPS louder and louder.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               Ry! I got sweet and sour chicken
               and beef and broccoli. Ryan?


     He walks upstairs and opens her bedroom door to reveal
     Ryan and QUINN (20) making out in bed together. Ryan
     wears a bra. Quinn is down to his boxers.

30                                                                30
     INT./EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - RYAN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                             RYAN
               Daniel! Get out!!

     Quinn leaps out of bed and heads for the window. Daniel
     drops the Chinese food bags and pins the shirtless boy by
     his neck against the wall.

                             QUINN
               Woah, woah. Calm down, it's not
               what you think.
                                                       40.


                        DANIEL
          I'm pretty sure it's what I think.
          How old are you?

                        RYAN
          Daniel! Get off of him.

                        DANIEL
          Shut up! I said, how old are you?

                       QUINN
          I'm 20.

                        DANIEL
          She's 16, and I was a cop. Looks
          like you picked the wrong girl.

            RYAN                           QUINN
You're choking him!             She said she was 18 online.

                        DANIEL
          If I ever see you anywhere near my
          Granddaughter again, I'm gonna rip
          your fucking dick off myself and
          shove it down your throat. You
          hear me?

                        QUINN
          Yes.

                        DANIEL
          You want that to happen?

                        QUINN
          Get my dick ripped off? No, that
          sounds horrible.

                        DANIEL
          Now get the fuck out of here.

                        QUINN
          I need my clothes.

                        DANIEL
          They're in my house, so they're my
          clothes now. Run away.

                        RYAN
          Daniel, get out of my fucking
          room!
                                                     41.


Quinn runs out of the room and out the front door. Daniel
pulls Quinn's DRIVERS LICENSE out of his WALLET and
examines it. Quinn runs in his boxers to his car. Daniel
screams after him.

                        DANIEL
          Hey, look, everybody! Statutory
          rapist from Williamsburg!

Some neighbors turn and stare.

                        QUINN
          I need my keys!

Daniel grabs them out of his jeans. And throws them out.

                         DANIEL
          Here you go! Look at him! He's
          travelin g to his car! Statutory
          rapist!

BELINDA (60's, neighbor) is watering her lawn. She stares
at naked Quinn.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Belinda, I just found that boy in
          bed with my Ryan.

                        QUINN
               (to Belinda)
          She said she was 18 online.

She sprays him in the groin with her hose.

                        BELINDA
          You're a fuck boy. He's a fuck
          boy. That's what the kids call
          them. Get out of our neighborhood,
          fuck boy! Right fucking now, wet
          flaccid fuck b oy!


BACK INSIDE:

                        RYAN
          I can't believe you just did that!

                        DANIEL
          Give me your phone. Give me the
          fucking phone right now. You are
          grounded, young lady. You are
          grounded until... I can't even
          think of a time right now that you
          won't be grounded.
                                                          42.


                             RYAN
               You can't just lock me up, Daniel.

                             DANIEL
               For the last fucking time, Ryan,
               you call me "Grandpa!"

     He slams the door shut.

                             RYAN
               I hate you! I fucking hate you!

31                                                               31
     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Daniel crosses into the kitchen. He closes his eyes,
     seething with rage. He bangs his head on a cabinet and
     then opens it. He slides a blender aside to reveal a
     BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. He brings it down and places it on the
     counter.

     He steps back and stares at it. It's a stand-off. He
     crosses to it and twists off its cap and places it beside
     the bottle. Then backs up to stare it again.

32                                                               32
     EXT. SUBURBAN ROADS/CHURCH - MORNING

     Allison rides her bike while looking at SCRAP OF PAPER
     with an address on it. She rides up to a small church and
     locks her bike out front. She covertly fishes out a pill
     from h er pocket and is about to take it, but she stops
     herself and breaks it in half before swallowing it.

33                                                               33
     INT. CHURCH HALL - DAY

     Allie sheepishly walks into an NA meeting that's about to
     begin. People are mingling and getting coffee. Just as
     she's about to sit, she looks up to see Daniel. They make
     eye contact. She races out the door.

34                                                               34
     INT. CHURCH LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

     Allison races out. Daniel trails behind her.

                             DANIEL
               Allison. Don't go.

                             ALLISON
               This was a mistake.
                                     43.


              DANIEL
No, it wasn't. Trust me, I know
how hard it is to get yourself
here. It's close to impossible,
and you did it. Don't run away now
because of me.

              ALLISON
There's a million of these
meetings; I'll find another one.

              DANIEL
But this one has the best snacks.

              ALLISON
I wanna go.

              DANIEL
If you came this far, you
shouldn't.

              ALLISON
I don't wanna be here.

              DANIEL
No one does at first.

              ALLISON
I don't wanna be any where.

              DANIEL
Then you're definitely in the
right spot.

              ALLISON
I thought you were sober.

              DANIEL
I've been sober 10 years. I
slacked off from coming regularly
and recently I started realizing I
could really use the support.

              ALLISON
Because of what happened?

              DANIEL
What? No, no, no.

              ALLISON
Is the accident the reason you had
to come back?
                                                          44.


                             DANIEL
               No! It's always good to...

                             ALLISON
               Daniel! Am I the reason you're
               here?!

                             DANIEL
               Yes! Yes! Of course! What the fuck
               do you want me to say?! Yes!

     He's instantly sorry. And collects himself.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry. Look... I've got 10
               years, and lately I would really
               like a drink. This works.

                             ALLISON
               Thank you. I'm going to find
               somewhere else. There are
               thousands of these meetings.

                             DANIEL
               There are. But som ehow you ended
               up at this one. Now isn't that
               something?

     He puts out his hand. She stares at it.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               Come on.

     She takes his hand, and he slowly leads her back inside.

35                                                               35
     INT. CHURCH HALL - MOMENTS LATER

     They reenter the meeting. SIMONE (tough, 40's) is
     starting the meeting. Under the below dialogue: Daniel
     walks Allie to an open seat. She takes it. Daniel finds a
     seat across the circle.

                              SIMONE
               Go od afternoon, ladies and
               gentlemen. This is the regular
               meeting of the "Live and Let Live"
               group of Alcoholics Anonymous. My
               name is Simone and I'm an
               alcoholic and your secretary. Let
               us open the meeting with a moment
               of silence to do with as you wish,
               followed by the Serenity Prayer.
                                                             45.


     A beat of silence. Allie stares at her Converse, too
     afraid to look up.

                             GROUP
               God, grant me the serenity to
               accept the things I cannot change,
               the courage to change the things I
               can, and the wisdom to know the
               difference.

     Allie looks up to make eye contact with Daniel. He gives
     her a friendly nod.

36                                                                 36
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

     Diane sits on a daybed with a book and a cigarette as
     Allison approac hes.

                             DIANE
               Hey, you got up awfully early this
               morning.

                             ALLISON
               I went to an NA meeting.

                             DIANE
               Really? Oh, I'm so happy to hear
               that. Look at you.

                             ALLISON
               I'm not saying I'm gonna go again.

                             DIANE
               Well you have to start somewhere.
               And you did. So that's good.

                             ALLISON
               I saw Daniel there.

                             DIANE
               Daniel who?

                             ALLISON
               Nate and Molly's dad Daniel. My
               almost father-in-law.

                              DIANE
               Oh my God. What did you say? You
               didn't t alk to him did you?

                             ALLISON
               I tried to leave. But he told me
               to stay.
                                     46.


              DIANE
We've got a whole `nother year
before the statute of limitations
is up. Stay far away from him.

              ALLISON
It wasn't like that. He was nice.
He's raising Ryan.

              DIANE
That's what I'd heard.

              ALLISON
He looked so much older. Like an
old grey statue in a park.

              DIANE
I'll bet. It's like presidents.

             ALLISON
What?

              DIANE
Remember how young Obama looked
when he won? Like, two days later,
his hair was grey. It's like they
took him into some secret bunker
and told him just how fucked
everything is, and he came out
looking 10 years older. Well
you're on your way. Just keep on
going to those meetings. "It works
if you work it." That's one of
their sayings.

              ALLISON
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to just quit, mom. I think I need
real help. Like an inpatient kinda
thing.

              DIANE
Well, neither of us has any
insurance, so how the hell are we
supposed to pay for it, Allie? You
need to get a job.

              ALLISON
Who's gonna hire me like this,
mom?
                                                47.


                         DIANE
           You're a 26-year-old, beautiful
           woman. You're smart, you're
           funny...

                         ALLISON
           You're describing the old me.

                         DIANE
           You're still you.

                         ALLISON
           No, I'm not. I'm something else
           now... something...

Silence.

                         ALLISON (CONT'D)
           I was thinking maybe dad was gonna
           give me a wedding gift. I mean,
           I'm sure he was gonna at least
           come, right? Maybe instead of
           whatever he was gonna give me, he
           could help me pay for help.

                        DI ANE
           Ha.

                         ALLISON
           Would you call him for me?

                         DIANE
           Allie, I will never speak to that
           man again as long as I live. He
           packed his car and left us with
           nothing.
                 (beat)
           I'm sorry that you only have me.
           That isn't... that isn't what I
           had planned for you. But it is
           what it is, and you gotta pick
           yourself up. Now.

                         ALLISON
           Thanks, mom. I'm sorry I can't get
           over this as fast as you want me
           to.

She walks off.
                                                        48.

     EXT. DUCK POND - DAY

     Daniel sits on a bench feeding the ducks. Nathan
     approaches. The ducks all scatter.

                             DANIEL
               Well, look who it is.

                                NATHAN
               Hi, Dad.

                             DANIEL
               What brings you to the less-
               glamourous side of the river?

                             NATHAN
               Ryan asked me to come see her.
               Turns out, she really wanted me to
               talk to you. She's worried about
               you.

                             DANIEL
               She's worried about me? That girl
               is crazy.

                             NATHAN
               She says she thinks you need a
               friend.

     Nathan sits.

                             DANIEL
               I don't need a friend, I need a
               dog-crate the size of a teenager.
               Look, I understand why you wanted
               to move away after the breakup,
               but I never imagined I'd be doing
               this all by myself.

                             NATHAN
               You raised two kids.

                             DANIEL
               Yeah, but I had your mother. And
               you and your sister were so well
               behaved compared to Ry.

     Nathan sha kes his head.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               What? Speak your mind, son.
                                               49.


                        NATHAN
          We were "good" because we were
          terrified of you. So, I'm not
          surprised you don't have any tools
          in your arsenal, since you lost
          the only one you had; fear.

                         DANIEL
          Oh, c'mon, Nathan. When are you
          gonna let all that go, huh? I've
          apologized a hundred times to you
          for the way I was. I can't go
          back. I was a drunk; I've done the
          work. I got 10 years, man. Your
          sister found a way to give me a
          secon d chance. Why can't you?

                        NATHAN
          Cause Molly never really got the
          brunt of it, did she? I protected
          her.

                        DANIEL
          I guarantee you if she was
          standing here right now she'd be
          begging you to let it go and help
          me raise her child.

                        NATHAN
          Well, she isn't.

                        DANIEL
          No, she is not. So, there's no
          future for us then? All we've got
          are pleasantries: "Hey, how are
          ya?" "Good. You?" That's all we've
          got until they sho vel me into a
          fucking hearse? We should be here
          for each other, Nathan. We're all
          we've got left.

                        NATHAN
          I gotta catch the train.

Nathan stands and starts to leave.

                         DANIEL
          I saw Allie.

He stops and turns back around.

                         NATHAN
          Where?
                                               50.


                        DANIEL
          I'm not supposed to say.

                        NATHAN
          AA?

                        DANIEL
          I'm not supposed to say.

                        NATHAN
          Why the hell does she need AA?

                        DANIEL
          I'm not supposed...

                        NATHAN
          ...to say. I got it. Of all the
          meetings, she has to go to yours?

                        DANIEL
          She saw me and tried to run away.
          I pulled her back in.

                       NATHAN
          Why?

                        DANIEL
          Because she's suffering, Nate.
          Broken. Lost.

                        NATHAN
          You're the one who blamed her! I
          stood by her.

                        DANIEL
          Yeah, until she le ft your ass.
                (beat, that stung)
          Sorry. That came out harsher than
          I meant it to.

                        NATHAN
          I have to catch the train.

                        DANIEL
          Nate. I need help.

                        NATHAN
          Look, Ryan asked me to come by and
          say hi to you. And I did.

                        DANIEL
          OK, well... Hi.

Nathan walks off.
                                                          51.

38                                                               38
     EXT. SOUTH ORANGE TRAIN STATION - LATER

     Nathan waits for his train. He taps a VIDEO on his phone.

     PHONE INSERT: The VIDEO is the moment Nathan mentioned in
     his toast at the engagement party. It's Allison playing
     the piano at the bar and serenading him. He holds the
     camera out in selfie-mode to include himself.

                             NATHAN
                    (IN VIDEO)
               Best first date ever!

     Allie LAUGHS in the video. Nathan freezes it on her
     smile. He thinks for a moment. His thumb hovers over the
     DELETE BUTTON. He pushes it.

39                                                               39
     INT. CHURCH HALL - DAY

     The group sits in a circle. Allie is there.

                             DANIEL
               I used to drink whiskey until I
               blacked out. Wake up in the
               morning to find out what I'd done;
               who I'd been. My father was a
               drunk, and he beat me right up
               until the day he died. So I
               promised myself I'd never lay a
               hand on my children. And I
               didn't...
                     (beat)
               when I was sober. But in the
               blackness, I did. I'd always deny
               it in the morning. Because the
               truth is, I didn't remember.
               Sometimes there'd be a bruise.
               "Oh, you must have fallen. I'm
               your daddy, I'd never hurt you."
               August 11th, `99, I awoke on my
               front porch to the sound of both
               the church bells and the ice cream
               truck. I knew that meant Sunday.
               First thing I saw was my Captai n
               standing over me; poking my rib
               cage with his nightstick. An
               ambulance. My son, Nathan...
               sitting on the back bleeding from
               his head. The medics had bought
               him a popsicle. It turns out that
               in the blackness I'd beat him so
               badly he lost the hearing in his
               right ear. Forever.
                                                            52.


     Allison's eyes widen in shock. She never knew.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               To this day, every time I see him,
               I beg him for his forgiveness.
               It's just a little dance we do...
               merely a formality. Because we
               both know that some things are
               just too impossible to forgive.
               Yeah. I do think even God knows
               that.

     He makes eye contact with Allie. She meets his gaze.

40                                                                40
     INT. DINER - DAY

     Daniel and Allison sit awkwardly in a booth. He has a mug
     of black coffee, she has a glass of water, no ice.

                             DANIEL
               When I was a cop, I'd eat here all
               the time. Free coffee refills.

     She flips the pages on the TINY TABLE-SIDE JUKEBOX.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               Are you hungry?

                             ALLISON
               No.

                             DANIEL
               It's funny how many things you
               stop caring about, huh? I used to
               wanna travel. I used to flip
               through National Geographic and
               dog ear the exotic places I'd one
               day visit once I retired. I'll
               never do that now.

                             ALLISON
               You still could.

                             DANIEL
               I couldn't.

                             ALLISON
               I wasn't drunk you know. Or on
               anything.

                             DANIEL
               What?
                                               53.


                        ALLISON
          When I saw you the other day at
          the meeting, I instantly started
          worrying that you thought I may
          have been drinking or on drugs the
          day of the accident. I was sober.
          It wasn't my fault.

                        DANIEL
          I've got every report that was
          written memorized.

                        ALLISON
          So you know it was the backhoe
          guy's fault. Alvarez.

                        DANIEL
          I don't wanna get into all that.

                        ALLISON
          Yeah. You're right.
               (beat)
          Nathan told me he'd bee n deaf
          since birth.

                        DANIEL
          He never told you?

                        ALLISON
          Maybe he wanted me to like you.

                        DANIEL
          Oh, I doubt that.
                (beat)
          I thought in raising Ryan I'd have
          a second chance at being a better
          father than I ever was, but... I'm
          in way over my head. I went and
          got this audio book out of the
          library about how to talk to a
          teen...

He laughs. She smiles.

                        ALLISON
          How's that working out?

                        DANIEL
          Well, it's from the 80' s... It's
          on cassettes. It recommended I
          chaperone a school dance.
                (a laugh)
          A dance.

                                                    54.
                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I just caught her having sex with
          a boy who looked like a man. A
          dance... ha. A dance would be
          delightful.

                        ALLISON
          Can I give you some advice from a
          former teenage girl? She's gonna
          have sex. Nothing you say is gonna
          stop that. Just make sure she gets
          on birth control.

                        DANIEL
          Birth control? She's 16. We'll be
          going the abstinence route.

                        ALLISON
          Well, no offense, but there's a
          knot in your logic. You're trying
          to solve the problem by looking
          away.
                (beat)
          You know... I could talk to her.
          If you want.

                        DANIEL
          Oh... No. It's very nice of you to
          offer. But I don't think it's
          appropriate.

                                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          ALLISON
Of course. I understand. I   No, it's OK. I just don't
don't even know why I said   think...
that, it's just...

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          I just felt the need... the
          instinct to try and help you in
          some way. It's the least I can do.
               (beat)
          I don't know how to do this.

                        DANIEL
          What?

                        ALLISON
          Start all over. How do you do
          that?

                        DANIEL
          Takes work.

                        ALLISON
          Can I tell you a secret?
                                                     55.


                        DANIEL
          Sure.

She leans in every so slightly.

                        ALLISON
               (whispers)
          I'm not sure I have the will.

He nods. He's been there. He throws a quarter into the
little JUKEBOX and plays a song. She notices a TATTOO on
his wrist. It says "Amor Fati".

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          What does "Amor Fati" mean?

                        DANIEL
          Certain things are private.

                        ALLISON
          Do you think I'm fucked up?

                        DANIEL
          Are you high right now?

                        ALLISON
          No.

                        DANIEL
          Look, I was a cop for 40 years and
          an addict for 50; so I'm gonna ask
          you again. Are you high right now?

                        ALLISON
          I broke a pill in half. So half?

                        DANIEL
          Then, yes. I think you're fucked
          up, Allison. And not half. All
          fucked up.

                        ALLISON
          Do you think I'll ever pull out of
          this? I mean, do you think I'll
          ever be the type of person that
          people would love to have hang out
          with their Granddaughter?

                        DANIEL
          I have no idea.

                         ALLISON
          Yeah . Me neither.
                                                          56.


     He sips his coffee. They listen to the song.

     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

     Daniel paints a miniature figurine for his train town as
     Ryan comes down the stairs and sits half-way down.

                             RYAN
               Can I please have my phone back?

                             DANIEL
               I'm running out of ideas on how to
               handle you, Ryan.

                             RYAN
               Everyone has sex at my   age,
               Grandpa. I know it was   different
               when you were younger,   but that's
               just, like, not how it   is anymore.

     Daniel thinks a second, then summons the courage.

                             DANIEL
               Are you... using protection?

                             RYAN
               Oh my God. I am so not gonna talk
               about this with my grandfather.

                             DANIEL
               Well, how the hell do you think I
               feel? Look, I know you're upset.

                             RYAN
               I'm not upset.

                             DANIEL
               Maybe you should go see that
               therapist again.

                             RYAN
               No. I just want my phone back. I
               don't have any friends at
               Columbia, and I need to h ang onto
               the few I still have from Long
               Beach Island.

                             DANIEL
               Why can't you make friends?

                             RYAN
               I've been through a lot this year.
               And nobody understands. They try.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
               Some. But it's fake. Don't you
               think most people are so fake?

                             DANIEL
               I'd probably say duplicitous.

                             RYAN
               What does that mean?

                             DANIEL
               Fake.

     They both smile.

                             DANIEL (CONT'D)
               I'm on your side.

                             RYAN
               I know.

                             DANIEL
               You can have your phone back, if
               you start taking birth control.

                             RYAN
               Oh my God! Daniel!

                             DANIEL
               Grandpa. Deal? I'll make the
               appointment.

                             RYAN
               Ugh. Fine. But I never want to
               talk about sex with you ever
               again.

                              DANIEL
               Rea lly? Cause I love this shit.

     He crosses off to get the phone.

     EXT. SETON HALL CAMPUS - DAY

     Allie walks with Simone through the bustling campus.

                             SIMONE
               Have you been on campus before?

                             ALLISON
               Not since I was a kid. I used to
               come here for swim meets.
                                     58.


              SIMONE
You were a swimmer?

              ALLISON
Well, I was twelve. But I was
pretty damn good. Still got all
the ribbons and trophies.

              SIMONE
That's cool. What stroke?

              ALLISON
Mostly freestyle.

              SIMONE
Why'd you stop?

              ALLISON
My father left. It was the thing
we did together. He'd cheer so
loud I could hear him underwater.
Seemed kind of pointless to do it
without him.

              SIMONE
Where'd he go?

              ALLISON
Ohio. He started a whole other
family in Ohio. He has ten-year-
old twins. Not sure if they swim
or not.

              SIMONE
I'm always amazed by these people
who can just up and leave their
kids. I don't understand how you
could sleep at night.

              ALLISON
For so many years, I thought I'd
done something wrong; like it was
my fault or I let him down
somehow. Then I just realized...
maybe some people just aren't
good.

              SIMONE
It's like he just restarted a
level in a video game with a fresh
life.
                                                          59.


                             ALLISON
               That's exactly what he did! He
               just packed up the car, left his
               Rolex in the attic of my dollhouse
               and drove away.

                             SIMONE
               Let's sit for a second.

     They sit on a bench.

                             SIMONE (CONT'D)
               Look, I'll sponsor you, but you
               gotta start taking this seriously.
               You can't keep coming to meetings
               high.

                             ALLISON
               What?! How did you know?

                             SIMONE
               Ha. Sweetheart, I was you. And
               I've helped dozens of women who
               were you. Some be at it, some are
               dead. But if you want my time, you
               gotta commit. I've got a toddler,
               I don't have time for bullshit.

                             ALLISON
               I do. I really wanna beat it.

                             SIMONE
               OK, well then I want you to do 90
               meetings in 90 days, and we're
               gonna get you started on step 1.

                              ALLISON
               OK.

                             SIMONE
               Also, enough hiding out. It's time
               you shared with the group.

     Off Allie's terrified face.

          Sorry. Can I start again? I've
          never done this before, and I'm
          nervous.

                        SIMONE
          You got it.

                        ALLISON

          Hi Allison.

                        ALLISON
          Hi. I um. Hmmm. I... I was the
          driver of a car that was in a bad
          accident. Two people died. They
          uh... it was the woman about to
          become my sister-in-law.

Simone puts it all together and looks at Daniel. Daniel
meets he r gaze and then looks back to Allison.

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          We were going to look at wedding
          dresses. And then we weren't. It
          wasn't my fault. I wasn't on drugs
          or drunk at the time. But, uh...
          surviving that day, was/is the
          most painful thing I'll ever have
          to live through. I got hurt too.
          They put a hole in my head. Which
          helped, because at least I had
          something to blame the pain on.
          But then that healed, and I was
          still hurting. And I guess that's
          why I never noticed how bad it
          got. Because to me, I was still in
          so much pain. I was prescribed
          them for physical pain... and they
          really did help with that... but
          they also made me numb. Blissfully
          numb. Without them I want to die.
          Every day. I've never said that
          out loud before. I haven't really
          ever faced reality without them.
          And I don't know if I'll b e able
          to handle what I see, but I'm here
          to try.

               You made all of this?

               I assembled and designed it all,
               yeah. The buildings come in kits
               you buy, so I put them together
               and paint them. The schoolhouse I
               built from scratch.

               He y, there's two kids making out
               back here.

                             DANIEL
               Yeah. That's me.

                             ALLISON
               You were handsome. And tiny.

                             DANIEL
               Ha. My very first kiss behind the
               school. Olivia Williams. It was
               fall, the tip of her nose was ice
               cold, running a bit. She stood on
               her tiptoes and tasted like bubble
               gum.

                             ALLISON
               Is that who you married?

                               DANIEL
               Ha. No. She   dumped me the next day
               for Charlie   Cook. He smoked Camels
               and drove a   Bu ick Riviera
               Roadmaster.   Way cooler than me.

                             ALLISON
               Is this all inspired by your life?
                                                     62.


                        DANIEL
          Kind of. It's meant to be South
          Orange. I grew up here. I was a
          cop in Newark, but I've always
          lived here.

                        ALLISON
          Who's the soldier?

                        DANIEL
          That's me the day I got home from
          Vietnam. That's my father picking
          me up from the station.

                        ALLISON
          This is incredible. How long did
          this take you?

                        DA NIEL
          Oh... years. I started with a
          single figure-eight and a two-car
          train. Just an engine and a
          caboose. I would just watch it go
          around and around. I work on it
          when I can. I've had a lot more
          time since I retired and my wife
          passed. When Ryan was little she'd
          hang out down here with me. She
          liked the whistle and the
          microphone.

                        ALLISON
          There's a microphone?

                         DANIEL
          Oh yeah, right next to you. How
          els e are you supposed to let your
          passengers know the train's
          coming?

She picks up the train whistle and blows it. They both
smile. She picks up the CB-style microphone.

                        ALLISON
               (sing into mic)
          Take the last train to Clarksville
          And I'll meet you at the station

                                               63.
                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          You can be here by four-thirty
          'Cause I've made your reservation,
          don't be slow
          Oh, no, no, no
          Oh, no, no, no

                        DANIEL
               (sings)
          And I don't know if I'm ever
          coming home.

                        ALLISON
          Just a little serenade for your
          people from the heavens.

                        DANIEL
          I think that's probably one of the
          reasons I enjoy it so much.

                        ALLISON
          Why? Because you get to play God?

                        DANIEL
          So much of my life, I've been out
          of control. But down here, I get
          to decide if Olivia Williams
          chooses me, and I get to decide if
          my father shows up to meet me at
          the station when I came home.

                        ALLISON
          Did he?

                        DANIEL
          No. He was passed out drunk in our
          backyard. He'd been face down long
          enough for an inch of snow to have
          collected on his back. The next
          morning at breakfast, he asked me
          if I wanted a beer. I drank a beer
          with him at breakfast and never
          stopped.
                (beat)
          When did you last talk to Nathan?

                        ALLISON
               (through mic)
          Daniel, this is God. Allison would
          like to change the conversation
          now.
                                                          64.


                             DANIEL
               Yeah, I'll bet she does. OK. Lets
               get out of here.

     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     They emerge from the basement steps just as Ryan comes in
     the front door. Daniel is surprised. Allie goes white.

                             DANIEL
               Oh, Ryan. Wait, it's only 1
               o'clock. Why are you home?

                             RYAN
               We had a half-day for the active
               shooter drill. I told you this
               morning.

                              DANIEL
               Ryan, this is a friend of mine
               from th e program.

                             ALLISON
               Hi.

                             RYAN
               Hi.

                             DANIEL
               Well, you should probably get
               going...

                             RYAN
               Wait. I know you from somewhere.

                             DANIEL
               No, you don't.

                             ALLISON
               You do?

                             RYAN
               How do I know you?

                             ALLISON
               My name is Allison.

                             RYAN
               I've seen you before.

                             DANIEL
               I thought the active shooter
               drills ended at two.
                                                     65.


                        RYAN
          That's when the pretend shooter
          fights back. Today, he shot
          himself, so we got out early. Why
          do I know you?

                        ALLISON
          I'm not sure what I'm supposed to
          say.

                        RYAN
          You were Nathan's fiancï¿½.

                        DANIEL
          No.

                        RYAN
          You were in the car.

                        DANIEL
          No.

                        ALLISON
          I was.

                        RYAN
          Weren't you driving? Wasn't she
          driving?

                        DANIEL
          We're in the program together.

                        RYAN
          But I thought you said it was her
          fault.

                        ALLISON
          What??

                        RYAN
          How could you br ing her into our
          house?! Get out of our fucking
          house!

Ryan cannot control the tears that start to stream down
her cheeks.

                        DANIEL
          Oh, baby. I'm so sorry. This is my
          fault. I thought you were at
          school. Allie, you really gotta
          go.

          You ruined my life!

          I know. I know that. I'm really
          sorry.

                        RYAN
          You shouldn't be here! My Mom grew
          up in this house! I sleep in her
          bedroom. I use her sheets!

                        DANIEL
          OK, OK, she's going, she's going.

 Allison opens the front door. She turns back.

                        ALLISON
          Just in case this is the only time
          I ever get to talk to you. Please
          know I wish it was me. Okay? I do.
               (beat)
          I'm gonna go.

She starts to lea ve.

                        RYAN
          I never got to say goodbye.

                        ALLISON
          I know.

                        RYAN
          They were going to see a play.

                        ALLISON
          I know.

                        RYAN
          She wanted to see a musical
          because she loved all the fancy
          costumes.

                        ALLISON
          I didn't know that.

                        RYAN
          She said you made Nate happy. That
          you were the best thing that ever
          happened to him.

                        ALLISON
          He made me happy too. We were a
          good team. I'm gonna go.
                                                            67.


     She starts to cry again. Daniel goes to comfort her.
     After a beat, Allison starts to exit the front door.

                              DANIEL
               Allison...

                              ALLISON
               Yes.

                             DANIEL

     Off Allie's unsure face...

            I just don't understand how if he
            was gonna stay with you, even

            They did?

          You quit the team! You're mouthing

                        RYAN
          I didn't say I quit the team
          permanently. I said I wanted to
          take a break. And I had a 4.0 down
          the shore, I could get it back in

They stare each other down. Silence.

She takes out her journal and jots down her number.

          Just in case you ever want to
          talk, need to talk - this is me.
          And it's up to you, but I'm here.
          OK.

Daniel clocks the exchange with concern. Ryan takes the
paper. Daniel walks Allie to the foyer. They speak in
hushed tones.

                        DANIEL
          I'm sorry about all that. You s ee

          It's fine.
                                                          70.


                             DANIEL
               Allie. Look, she's a very fragile
               kid. I'd appreciate it if you
               didn't make contact with her.

                             ALLISON
               Oh. OK. I just wanted her to know
               that I'm available to her if she
               ver wants to talk.

                             DANIEL
               I'm asking you to please just let
               her be.

     She holds up her hand with the Vulcan salute.

                             ALLISON
               OK. Scout's honor.

                             DANIEL
               You're doing Spock's "Live long
               and prosper." We scouts do this.

     He holds up his two f ingers.

                             ALLISON
               I think I prefer Spock. Live long
               and prosper, Daniel.

     She exits the front door.

     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     Allie tries to write a song on her keyboard. She notices
     the canister of pills in front of her and turns the label
     facing away.

     She plays a few more chords before frustratedly resting
     her head on the keys making a CLANG.

     She sits up, grabs her phone and op ens up Instagram. She
     hesitates a beat. Then types in Nathan's handle. Her
     thumb floats above his profile in the menu. Just as she's
     about to push it, she gets a text:

     Ryan: Hey, it's Ryan. Coffee?

48                                                               48
     INT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - INTERCUT

     Ryan sits alone at an empty table in a packed cafeteria.
     We INTERCUT between both locations as they text.
                                                           71.


     Allie: Daniel asked me to give you some space.

     Ryan: I wanna know more about that day.

     Allie stares at her phone. After a beat...

     Allie: Go back to the soccer team. Tell Daniel I
     convinced you.

     Allie: I'll come to your game. I wanna see you in action.

     Ryan stares at her phone. Allie waits for a reply.

     Ryan: ...Fine.

     Allie: Wait? Really?!!

     Ryan: Yeah. I'm not gonna let those bitches keep me from
     Stanford. See ya Saturday.

     Allie smiles faintly. A tiny win.

49                                                               49
     EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

     Daniel and Allison, sitting on opposite ends of the
     bleachers, cheer as Ryan SCORES A GOAL!

                               DANIEL
               That a girl!

     Ryan looks over at them and makes a goofy face. Daniel
     looks over to see Allie. She looks back at him.

                            DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    (mouthing from afar)
               Thank you.

     She smiles. Th ey turn back to the game.

     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - ALLISON'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Allie tosses and turns in bed. She's covered in sweat and
     shaking from withdrawal. JUMP CUTS OF INSOMNIA. She tries
     tapping different parts of her face and chest.

51                                                               51
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - ALLISON'S ROOM - MORNING

     Allie lies awake in bed. No sleep. HER PHONE DINGS.

     Daniel: Allie, this is Daniel. Maybe it would help for
     Ryan to talk to you. Coffee with her after school?
                                                          72.


     Allie thinks...

     Allie pulls up on her bike and locks it.

     INT. HIP COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

     Allie sits at a table across from Ryan. She looks white
     from withdrawal.

                             RYAN
               Why do you ride a bike everywhere?

                             ALLISON
               I haven't been in a car since the
               accident.

                             RYAN
               Cause you feel guilty?

                             ALLISON
               No. Because I feel scared.

                             RYAN
               Daniel says you were on your
               phone.

     Allison looks back at Daniel sitting at a table out of
     earshot.

                             ALLISON
               I was using MAPS. Everyone uses
               MAPS.

                             RYAN
               He has all the reports. He's
               memorized them. He stares at them
               at night. It's weird.

                             ALLISON
               Well... I was there. Whoever wrote
               those reports wasn't there.

                             RYAN
               Tell me why you ended it with
               Nate? My mom would want you guys
               to be together still.

                             ALLISON
               Well... I don't even know what to
               say to that.
                                               73.


                        RYAN
          My mom used to really look out for
          him, you know? And I was thinking
          like... maybe I'm supposed to now.
          Cause she can't...

                        ALLISON
          I bet that would make your mom
          proud.

                        RYAN
          Don't you miss him? I can tell you
          about what's happening in his
          life, if you want.

Allie's lungs tighten.

                        ALLISON
          That's OK. Thank you, though. I've
          been really trying to avoid...

                        RYAN
          He moved to Tribeca.

                           ALLISON
          Wow, OK.

                           RYAN
          He h as a dog.

                           ALLISON
          A dog?

                        RYAN
          Yeah, it's a French Bulldog named
          Jasper.

                        ALLISON
          Wow. He never really struck me as
          the Frenchie type.

                        RYAN
          Well, it's his girlfriend's.

                        ALLISON
          Oh. I don't need to hear this.

                           RYAN
          Are you OK?

                        ALLISON
          Yeah, I'm fine. It's just... How
          long have they been going out?
                                                          74.


                             RYAN
               Like four months, I think?

                             ALLISON
               Wow.

                             RYAN
               Yeah, she's a paralegal? I don't
               even know what that is. Is that
               like a good thing to be?

                             ALLISON
               Yes. Wow.

                             RYAN
               You just keep saying, "Wow."

                             ALLISON
               It's just a lot to take in. I'm so
               happy for him. He deserves to be
               happy.

                             RYAN
               I shouldn't have told you.

                             ALLISON
               No. It's fine.

                             RYAN
               But you look so upset now.

                             ALLISON
               He and I went through so much
               together. I only want good things
               for him.

                             RYAN
               I'm sorry I upset you. I really
               meant for this to be friendly.

                             ALLISON
               I'm fine. I'm just gonna go use
               the bathroom.

     She darts for the bathroom. Daniel watches, concerned.

     WE SEE FULLSCREEN FLASHES: the French Bulldog, Nathan
     laughing, Nathan on a Beach with his girlfriend, the two

     Allie reemerges with red eyes passing Daniel's table.

                             DANIEL
               Is something wrong?

                             ALLISON
               Yeah, I just... I forgot I have a
               job interview. So, I gotta go.

                             DANIEL
               You sick?

                             ALLISON
               Yeah.

                             DANIEL
               Withdrawal?

                             ALLISON
               Trying.

                             DANIEL
               Don't stop.

                             ALLISON
               OK.

                             DANIEL
               Don't use.

                             ALLISON
               OK.

               Don't stay home tonight. Go do
               something.

                             ALLISON
               OK.

                             DANIEL
               Do you need a hug?
                                                          76.


                             ALLISON
               If you hug me, I'm going to sob,
               so no.

                             DANIEL
               I can handle that.

                             ALLISON
               I better not. In front of Ryan.

                             DANIEL
               OK.
                    (beat)
               I'm hugging you with my eyes.

                             ALLISON
               Thank you.

                             DANIEL
               Be careful.

                             ALLISON
               OK.

     She nods and exits the coffee shop, passing Ryan's table,
     unable to look at her.

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    (in passing)
               I have to go, so I'll see you

               Allie? Allie? Allie? Did you job-
               hunt today?

                             ALLISON
               Please leave me alone.

                             DIANE
               Listen, I've been looking on Etsy.
               I was thinking we could find a
               craft we both like and sell them.
               Maybe we could make some extra
               money that way. Whaddya think?

     Allie shakes her head. She's trapped and very fucking
     depressed. Her phone chimes. Someone!

     Ryan: I'm so sorry.

     Allison: Don't be! I'm fine!

     Ryan: Wanna do something?

                             DIANE (CONT'D)
               Something fun. Like baby bibs. Or
               invent our own salad dressing?
               Allie, we could be on Shark Tank!
               Can you imagine? And I know you're
               like, "Shut up, mom, you're drunk
               again," but listen...

     Allison: Don't think Daniel would be cool with us going
     to the city.

                             DIANE (O.S.)
               I just thought of the best idea.
               We could do paper mache!

     Ryan: OK. Well I'm taking the 8:10pm train from South
     Orange station. If I get kidnapped, it's your fault!

     BACK AT ALLISON'S:

     Allie throws her phone and shakes her head. She looks up
     at herself in the makeup mirror.

                             DIANE (CONT'D)
               "Hey, Sharks, I'm Diane and this
               is my associate. Allison. And this
               is our... you know, whatever..."

                             ALLISON
                    (to herself in
                     mirror)
               You weak piece of shit. Couldn't
               go two days. I fucking hate you. I
               hate you so much.

                             DIANE
               Allie, do you remember when you
               were in the fourth grade and you
               built that giant mitochondrion?
               Someone would buy that, I promise
               you! "Hey, Sharks, you know how
               everyone loves paper mache?"

     Allie leaps up and opens her bedroom door.

61                                                                 61
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Allie comes out and steps over her mom.

                             DIANE
               I knew you'd like that idea!
                                                            79.


     She walks to the bathroom holding a canister of pills and
     slams the door.

62                                                                62
     INT. DIANE'S HOUSE - ALLISON'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     She stares in the mirror, grabs the canister, opens it up
     without pausing and dumps the entire vial of pills in her
     mouth. A lethal dose. She keeps them in her mouth. She's
     about to swallow.

     A QUICK FLASH OF NATHAN LOOKING INTO THE LENS.

     She spits them all out and watches th em slide down the
     sink drain. She sits on the side of the tub. Terrified.

63                                                                63
     EXT. SOUTH ORANGE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

     Ryan waits alone on a bench in a provocative outfit. A
     TRAIN RUMBLES by to reveal Allison standing on the
     opposite platform. Ryan stands and celebrates.

                              RYAN
               Yes!

                             ALLISON
               You're on the wrong side.

                             RYAN
               What? No, I'm not.

     Allison points to a sign that says "Trains to Manhattan."

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
               Oh. Well, good thing you came!

     Allie shakes her head.

64                                                                64
     INT./EXT. DIANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Diane stands in the kitchen texting.

     Diane: Where r u???!!!

     A KNOCK on the front door. She looks up in fear and runs
     to the door. She opens it to reveal Daniel with his hat
     in his hand.

                             DANIEL
               Hello, Diane. I'm very sorry to
               call on you this late, but I
               didn't have your number.
                                                      80.


She stares at him in shock.

                        DIANE
          Oh, hey.

                        DANIEL
          It's Daniel, Nathan's father.

Diane covers her mouth with her hand. She's frozen.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Don't you remember me?

                        DIANE
          Yes, of course. I'm sorry, it's
          been a long time.

                        DANIEL
          There's no need to be afraid of
          me. I'm just trying to find Ryan.

                        DIANE
          I'm not afraid of you. To be
          honest, I thought it might be the
          police. A bit of PTSD I suppose.

                        DANIEL
          Yes, well... I don't know how much
          Allie's told you, but we've been
          going to the same program.

                        DIANE
          Yes. I know. She said.

                        DANIEL
          Yeah. So, my granddaughter,
          Ryan's, taken quite an interest in
          Allie, and now I can't find her,
          so I thought I'd stop by and see
          if they might be here. I tried
          texting Allie, but all my texts
          are turning green. Do you know
          what that means?

                        DIANE
          I have no idea. I hate it when
          they go green, and you don't know
          if it's sent. It drives me crazy.
          You'll have to let me know if you
          figure that out. I'm not a techie.

They stand there nodding with their phones.
                                                      81.


                        DIANE (CONT'D)
          I've actually been trying to find
          Allie as well. Do you think
          they're together?

                        DANIEL
          They're both missing at the same
          time, so it does feel a bit
          curious.

                        DIANE
          No matter how old they get, you
          never stop worrying, but they
          always seem to turn up.

                        DANIEL
          Well... not always.

Diane is taken aback by his bluntness.

                        DIANE
          Yes. Well... please let me know if
          you find them.

                         DANIEL
          I will.

Daniel begins to wal k away as Diane starts to close the
door. She summons the courage and calls to him.

                         DIANE
          Thank you.

                         DANIEL
          What's that?

                        DIANE
          I just wanted to say thank you
          for... being kind to Allie. She
          told me you were... very warm to
          her. And you know... some people
          wouldn't be like that.

                        DANIEL
          We're all just trying to move on,
          I suppose.

                        DIANE
          I don't think Allie and I are
          doing a very good job of that,
          Daniel.

                        DANI EL
          Well, you know what they say.
                                                          82.


                              DIANE
               What?

                             DANIEL
               "Comparison is the thief of joy."

                             DIANE
               I didn't know they said that.

                             DANIEL
               Well, somebody did.
                    (beat)
               I best be going.

                             DIANE
               Yes, of course.

                              DANIEL
               Goodnight.

65                                                               65
     INT. ROCK CLUB - NIGHT

     CARY BROTHERS and his BAND play on stage. Quinn, the guy
     from Ryan's bedroom, is in the audience. We waves to Ryan
     from afar.

                             RYAN
               Oh my God, there he is. Look how
               hot he is.

                             ALLISON
               Is that a face tattoo?

                              RYAN
               Ye ah!

     THOMAS (22, guitarist in the band) appears to be staring
     at Allie.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
               I love this song. Quinn sent it to
               me in a playlist. He knows so much
               about music.

                             ALLISON
               I haven't seen live music in so
               long. Thank you. For getting me to
               come.

                             RYAN
               The guitarist, that's Thomas. He's
               staring right at you.
                                                      83.


                        ALLISON
          Not interested.

                        RYAN
          I know, you can do so much better.
          But he is fucking hot. OK, I'll be
          right back. I gotta go get someone
          in.

                        ALLISON
          Should I come with you?

                        RYAN
          No! I'll be right back.

Ryan rushes off. Allison continues to get into the music.
She closes her eyes. She sways her head with her eyes
closed and a tiny smile crawls across her lips.

SLOW MOTION: She's having a moment of genuine hap piness.
The moving stage lights dance around her face.

She opens her eyes to see Nathan, staring right into the
lens. Is this A DREAM??? Reveal JOELLE, his new
girlfriend.

                        RYAN (CONT'D)
          Surprise!

Allie is in shock. So is Nathan. They have to speak
loudly over the MUSIC.

                        ALLISON
          Nathan?

                        NATHAN
          Hi.

                        ALLISON
          Hey.

                        NATHAN
          Ryan.

                        RYAN
          What?

                        JOELLE
          Hi.

Allison is stuck in shock. She can barely breath.
                                               84.


                        NATHAN
          Uhhhh, sorry. Allie, this is my
          girlfriend, Joelle.

                        ALLISON
          Hi. Sorry. So nice to meet you.

                        JOELLE
          I've heard so much about you.

                          ALLISON
          Oh. OK...

                        NATHAN
          I think we're the victims of a
          teenage girl's good intentions.

                          ALLISON
          What?

                        NATHAN
          I said, I think she meant well;
          Ryan.

                        ALLISON
          OK. Um, I have to go.

                          NATHAN
          Are you good?

                        ALLISON
          Yeah. Yup. Everything's good.
          Yeah. But, I have to go.

Allison races away. Th ey watch her go.

                        NATHAN
          What the fuck did you do that for?

                        RYAN
               (to Joelle)
          You weren't supposed to come. No
          offense. I know that being a
          paralegal is a good job. But he's
          supposed to be with Allie. I'm
          sorry.

                        NATHAN
          Ryan, what the fuck did you do?

                        RYAN
          I'm fixing it. For mom.
                                                          85.


                             NATHAN
               Go find her. And then I'm taking
               you home.

     She runs off. Nathan shakes his head. Fuck.

                             NATHAN (CONT'D)
                    (to Joelle)
               I am so sorry.

                               JOELLE
               It's fine.

                             NATHAN
               Yeah? You're good?

                             JOELLE
               I'm fine. I need a drink, but I'm
               fine.

66                                                              66
     INT. ROCK CLUB - BACK BAR - MOMENTS LATER

     Allie grabs someone's drink that's been left on the bar
     and downs it. Ryan arrives.

                             ALLISON
               Why the fuck did you do that?!

                             RYAN
               I thought it would make y ou happy.

                             ALLISON
               You thought it would make me
               happy?! Are you insane?
                    (to bartender)
               Can I have a triple tequila neat
               please? I can't breathe.

                             RYAN
               Calm down. I'm sorry.

                             ALLISON
               You did this on purpose; to hurt
               me. You set me up.

                               RYAN
               No, I didn't!

     Thomas and Quinn come rushing over.

                               THOMAS
               Yesssssss!
                                                          86.


                             RYAN
               Hi, I'm Quinn's friend, Ryan. You
               guys sounded so good. You're gonna
               be so famous.

                             THOMAS
               I know. I really have to savor my
               anonymity.

                             QUINN
               We're going to this party over in
               Williamsburg. You guys wanna come?

                             ALLISON
               Yes. I need to get out of here.

     She downs the tequila that's just arrived and they all
     leave excitedly. Nathan watches from afar wondering what
     the fuck is happening.

     INT. SIMONE'S APART MENT - NIGHT

     Simone and her boyfriend, MAX, eat takeout while watching

               Hey Danny. Everything OK?

     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - INTERCUT BACK AND FORTH

     Daniel paces.

                             DANIEL
               I can't find Ryan, and I've tried
               everything. Anyway, my mind
               couldn't help but wonder if you'd
               heard from Allie or not.

                             SIMONE
               No, I haven't. I can text her, if
               you want.

                             DAN IEL
               Well, I keep trying them both, but
               neither one is replying.

     INT. WILLIAMSBURG LOFT - NIGHT

     A group of WILLIAMSBURG TYPES smoke and drink. Ryan and
     Quinn wear VR HEADSETS drunkenly playing some game.

                             RYAN
               Woah, this is amazing.

     Allison stands in the kitchen and stares at her phone as
     a BARRAGE OF MISSED TEXTS start streaming in.

     Mom: WHERE ARE YOU!

     Simone: Daniel's looking for Ryan. Any idea where she is?

     Daniel: Allie, are you with Ryan?

     Mom: Call or text me plz!

     Simone: Why aren't you texting me back???

     Thomas brings JARVIS over to Allie.

                             THOMAS
               Allie, this is Jarvis. He brought
               the thing you asked for.

                             JARVIS
               I don't have any 30's. Just dope.

                             ALLISON
               I'll just take whatever you have.
                    (to Thomas)
               Can you spot me? I promise I'll
               pay you back.

                             THOMAS
               Uh OK.

     Thomas pays him and hands Allie the tiny bag of heroin.
                                                     88.


                        ALLISON
          You want some?

                        THOMAS
          Nooo. I don't fuck with that shit.

                        ALLISON
          Oh, I don't either, but I don't
          have any of the medicine I take,
          so I'm just gonna do a tiny bit.

She turns her back from the party and snorts some.

                        THOMAS
          I mean, don't get me wrong; I
          wanna be Kurt Cobain, but I don't
          wanna be Kurt Cobain. Know what I
          mean?
                (beat)
          Did you like the show?

                        ALLISON
          What?

                        THOMAS
          Our set. Did you like it?

                        ALLIS ON
          Oh, yeah. Yeah. You were great.

                        THOMAS
          I play with Cary when he's on
          tour, but wait until you hear my
          stuff.

                        ALLISON
          Great.

                        THOMAS
          Do you think I'm gonna be famous?

                        ALLISON
          What?

                        THOMAS
          I said, do you think I'm gonna be
          famous?

                        ALLISON
          Oh, I don't know.
                                                             89.


                             THOMAS
               One day, when I'm super famous,
               you can tell people I bought you
               heroin once.

                             ALLISON
               Yeah... for sure.

     Behind her we see Ryan being led into a bedroom by Quinn.

     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Daniel sits using "Find My Phone" at his kitchen table
     while Simone talks him through it on his own phone.

                             DANIEL
               OK, it's coming up. I think it's
               working...

                             SIMONE (O.S.)
               What's it say?

     On the scre en we see the map come alive and show a dot on
     the loft in Williamsburg.

71                                                                 71

     Ryan is wasted, she and Quinn are making out on the bed.

                             RYAN
               The whole room is spinning.

     Her PHONE PINGS on the bed.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
               That's my phone.

                             QUINN
               Don't worry about it.

                             RYAN
               Wait, just stop for a second.
               Where's my phone?

     WE PUSH in on the phone on the bed. WE CAN SEE IT SAYS
     "FIND MY PHON E ALERT."

72                                                                 72

                             DANIEL
               What the fuck?!

                             DANIEL
               She's in the fucking city! She's
               in motherfucking Williamsburg!

                             SIMONE
               Daniel. Wait. I'll pick you up.
               You don't wanna do something
               you'll regret.

                             DANIEL
               I'm gonna fucking kill him.

                             SIMONE
               Exactly. That's what I'm worried
               about. I'm on my way.

     BACK AT DANIEL'S:

                             DANIEL
               FUCK!!!

     He slams his phone down. His anger grows. H e turns his
     head to stare at the high cabinet where he keeps his
     WHISKEY. He crosses to the pantry and uses the step-stool
     to reach the high cabinet. He pulls down the BOTTLE OF
     WHISKEY again.

     He pulls open a drawer revealing a small gun safe. He
     taps in his code and it pops open revealing his REVOLVER.

74                                                               74
     INT. WILLIAMSBURG LOFT - NIGHT

     AN HOUR OR SO LATER. The party is even more packed. Allie
     straddles Thomas on the couch. She tries to get up, but
     falls over onto other people on the couch.

                             THOMAS
               OK. Easy does it. You're wasted.

                             ALLISON
               No, I'm not. I gotta find her.
                                                             91.


     Allie stumbles sideways through the party. HER POV: the
     hallway comes IN AND OUT OF FOCUS as we travel on a
     diagonal towards the door. LASER LIGHTS from a PARTY
     GLOBE splash her face as she weaves through the people.

                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               Ryan!

     EXT. WILLIAMSBURG LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

     Simone's CAR SCREECHES to a stop in front of the
     apartment. As Daniel hops out of the passenger side, the
     NOW-EMPTY WHISKEY BOTTLE falls out of his coat pocket and
     SHATTERS on the ground. SIMONE clocks it.

76                                                                 76

     Allison has made her way to a locked bedroom door and
     starts to knock.

                             ALLISON
               Ryan! Ryan, are you in there?

                             QUINN (O.S.)
               She's fine. Go the fuck away!

     Daniel and Simone burst in and weave the ir way through
     the party. We can see the drunken RAGE in Daniel's eyes.
     They find Allie knocking on the door.

                             ALLISON
               Ryan!!! Can you open the door

               Where's Ryan?!

                             ALLISON
               She won't open the door.

     No answer.

                                DANIEL (CONT'D)
                  Open the door, baby.

                                QUINN (O.S.)
                  Fuck off!

     The cop in Daniel steps back and KICKS OPEN THE DOOR.

                  What the fuck?!

     Daniel raises his gun and points it at Quinn.

                                DANIEL
                  You again. Get the fuck up.

     Allison and Simone come rushing in. Quinn ju mps up with
     his hands in the air.

                                SIMONE
                  Danny! No, no, no, don't do that.

                                QUINN
                  Nothing happened.

                                DANIEL
                  She's passed out! Tell me why I

                  You hurt my baby. Now it's time
                  for me to hurt you.

     He cocks the revolver's hammer back.

                               NATHAN (O.S.)
                  Dad, stop.

     REVEAL Nathan has appeared behind him in the doorway.
                                                      93.


                        DANIEL
          What the hell are you doing here,
          Nate? This is family business.

                        NATHAN
          Please don't do this.

                        DANIEL
          Go on back to your new life.

                        QUINN
          Put the gun down. Please! Please!

                        NATHAN
          He's not worth it.

                        DANIEL
          I have nothing left to lose.

                        NATHAN
          You have me. You have Ryan. We
          need you. If you do this, it's
          over. We get no more time.

                        SIMONE
          Danny, put the gun down.

Nathan steps in front of his father, so the gun is now
pointed at him. Daniel with all of his rage stares his
son down. Nathan, with newfound bravery, slowly takes the
gun out of his father's hand.

Nathan turns to Quinn.

                        NATHAN
          That's my niece. She's 16 years
          old.

He PUNCHES Quinn hard in the face. Quinn goes down.

                        QUINN
          Agh! My fucking nose!

Nathan goes to the bed and helps Simone stand Ryan up.
She stirs enough to lean on Simone and Nathan as they
walk out.

                         SIMONE
          We go tta get outta here.

SLOW MOTION: Danny walks through the party with Allison
by the arm, like the criminals he used to arrest. Simone
and Nathan follow carrying Ryan.

     Simone and Nathan handle Ryan as Daniel holds Allie by

               What the fuck is the matter with

               Well, let me tell you something,
               Allison. You could never, ever fix

               I wanted to hate you, but I
               stopped myself. And when you
               walked into that meeting, I said
               to myself "This is God testing me.
               This is proof there's a higher
               power! He's testing me in this

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          He's seeing if he can break me.
          But I'm gonna show him... I'm
          gonna show him that I am
          unbreakable, and I am gonna offer
          my hand to this sorry, little,
          fucking pill-junkie."
          All I asked was that you stay away
          from this child. Now look at her.

Allie looks over. Simone cradles her on the steps.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          She's got no mother, no father...
          And how many years could I have
          left? What a fucking waste you
          are. What a waste of a soul. What
          a waste of a chance.

He walks away a beat to calm down.

                        SIMONE
          OK, Danny. You've said your piece.
          Enough.

                        DANIEL
          This wasn't how it was supposed to
          go. I'm a good person. I'm not
          saying God has to be f air, but I
          never thought... I just never
          thought he could be this cruel.

He exhales. Nods his head. He's done.

                        DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Taxi!

                        SIMONE
          Danny, let me take you home.

                        DANIEL
          No.

                        NATHAN
          I'll go with them.

A cab pulls over. Danny opens the door and places Ryan
inside. He comes back to Allie; inches from her face. She
can smell his breath.

                        ALLISON
          You drank.
                                                              96.


                             DANIEL
               You reopened the MAPS app at 17:36
               and 22 seconds. The impact was at
               17:36 and 24. Tire skids show you
               lost 30 feet before you swerved.
               You didn't have time to stop
               because you were looking at your
               fucking phone. Stop blaming
               Alvarez. They're dead because of
               you.

     He walks away and gets in the cab. Nathan makes eye-
     contact with Allie briefly and joins his father. They
     drive off. Allie stands in the middle of the street.
     Decimated.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

     INT. SIMONES APARTMENT - MORNING

     Allie wakes up on the couch to see Simone's toddler,
     Elvis, playing. HER ROLEX sits on the coffee table in
     front of her. She stares at it as she sits up.

                               ELVIS
               Good morning.

                               ALLISON
               Good morning.

                             ELVIS
               I made a house. Do you have a
               headache?

                               ALLISON
               Yeah.

81                                                                  81
     INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

     Allie walks to the counter and hands the wa tch to the
     Pawn Shop Owner. She sweats and shakes.

                             ALLISON
               Hey, can I sell this please?

     He inspects the watch.

                             PAWN SHOP OWNER
               I'll give you twelve-five.

                             ALLISON
               Yeah. OK. Thank you.
                                                             97.


                             PAWN SHOP OWNER
               It's a beauty.

     He passes her the cash.

82                                                                 82
     INT. INPATIENT REHAB - DAY

     MONTAGE: Allie's 28-Day Program.

     82A: Allie is searched in her dorm room by a STAFF MEMBER
     checking all of her pockets for contraband. She finds the
     leftover bag of heroin.

     82B: Allie walks nervously into her first meeting. She
     looks haggard and frail as she joins the circle.

     82C: Allie is given a pill in a paper cup as s he leaves a
     group meeting and heads down a hallway. She looks through
     the window in a door to notice a tiny music room with a
     piano. She lifts open the cover. She stares at it a beat
     and then sits down to play the original song we have
     heard her writing in her room at home.

     82D: Ryan scores the winning goal on the soccer field.
     Daniel and Nathan cheer.

     82E: Allie dives into a lap pool and swims.

     82F : Allie is back at the piano playing and singing.

     82G: Daniel sits reading a WOMEN'S FITNESS MAGAZINE in
     the waiting room of a GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE. Ryan exits
     from the doctor's office with a PACKAGE OF BIRTH CONTROL
     PILLS in her hand. Daniel gives her a thumbs-up. She
     rolls her eyes.

     82H: Allie, in her room, writing her mom a handwritten
     letter.

     82I: Diane lies in her bed on the side porch reading

     82L: Ryan sits in the basement, chatting away to Daniel.
     He paints a new structure: A MODEL OF HIS OWN HOUSE.

     82M: Allie singing the song she wrote at the piano.
                                                          98.


     82N: Allie walks down a hallway. She enters a Visitor's
     Room and is clearly anxious about who's she's looking at.

     82O: Allie surfaces from underwater in the pool and takes
     a huge breath.

83                                                               83
     INT. INPATIENT REHAB - VISITOR'S ROOM - DAY

     REVEAL Allie's visitor is Nathan.

                               ALLISON
                  Hey.

                               NATHAN
                  Hi.

     They sit down opposite one another at a table.

                                ALLISON
                  Thank you so much for coming.

                                NATHAN
                  You look great.

                                 ALLISON
                  Ha. I w as about to put make-up on
                  and then laughed at myself. Do you
                  like my clips?

                                NATHAN
                  Wow. Yeah.

                                ALLISON
                  Thanks. I stole them from a
                  pharmacy. Not recently, like
                  awhile back.

     He smiles.

                                NATHAN
                  I don't know where to start.

                                ALLISON
                  I'll just start. Nate, I didn't
                  have the faintest idea how to
                  handle my own grief. I didn't even
                  know if I was allowed to grieve.

                                NATHAN
                  We were all flailing.
                                               99.


                        ALLISON
          But I abandoned you. That was so
          selfish. I ran as fast as I could
          away from you.

                        NATHAN
          I still wanted you to be my wife.

                        ALLISON
          I know. The truth is...

She takes a deep breath. Exhales.

                        ALLISON (CONT'D)
          The truth is, Nathan... I was so
          sure that I was gonna...

                         NATHAN
          I know...

                        ALLISON
          And I... you know... I tried...
          but I couldn't. Because I didn't
          ever want to hurt you again.

                        NATHAN
          It wasn't your fault.

                        A LLISON
          It was, Nate.
               (beat)
          Your dad's right. If I hadn't been
          checking my phone, I could have
          stopped in time.
               (beat)
          You deserve an apology that has
          never come. I'm so sorry.

He digests this. Nods.

                        NATHAN
          I've been spending a little more
          time with him lately. It's a work
          in progress.

                        ALLISON
          Good. He kept me alive.
               (beat)
          I know about your ear.

She puts her hand to his right ear.
                                                          100.


                             ALLISON (CONT'D)
               I want you to be clear on one
               thing... Look at me. I loved you
               so much. Along with everything
               else, I will forever grieve for
               the life we might have had.

                             NATHAN
               Me too. We were a good team.
                    (silence...then)
               It would be nice if we could one
               day find a way to be in each
               other's lives. Maybe that's
               unrealistic...

                             ALLISON
               Maybe.

                             NATHAN
               Maybe.

     He reaches his hands across the table to hers. She grabs
     th em and holds them. She puts them on her face, and they
     smile at one another.

84                                                               84
     INT. INPATIENT REHAB - NIGHT

     Allie's last night at the recovery center. Supportive
     families are there in attendance. We see Diane holding
     flowers. Allie stands at the podium mid-speech. She
     speaks passionately and ends with a laugh.

                             ALLISON
               Momma, I'm so grateful for you.
               Thank you for everything you've
               done for me, and I love you.

     Allie crosses to Diane, and they hug. She looks up to see
     Daniel standing in the doorway.

     Her face drops as she mouths "Hi." Daniel smiles warmly
     and nods. She wants to go to him, but she's inundated
     with well-wishers around her.

     When she looks up again, he's gone.

     WE FADE TO BLACK on Allie's face searching for Daniel.

85                                                               85
     INT. HUMBLE APARTMENT - EVENING

     Allison eats alone at her kitchen table . She checks her
     watch, A CHEAP CASIO.
                                                             101.

86                                                                  86
     INT. MUSIC BAR - STAGE - NIGHT

     A tiny music bar in downtown Newark. Allie is on stage at
     the piano playing an original song. She finishes.

                             ALLISON
               Thank you. I'm selling my first EP
               over at the coat check, cause I'm
               also the coat-check girl. So come
               buy an album... or I won't give
               you your coats back.

     They LAUGH. She smiles.

87                                                                  87
     INT. MUSIC BAR - COAT CHECK - MOMENTS LATER

     Back in her booth, Allie's pho ne rings: it's Nathan.

                             ALLISON
               I know you're calling about one
               year clean, but guess what I just
               did?

     Her face drops.

88                                                                  88
     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Allie and Nathan set out food for mourners dressed in
     black. Diane and Ryan play with Elvis and Simone. As
     Allie clears a bunch of empty plates back to the kitchen,
     she walks by the basement door. She stops and stares at
     the door.

89                                                                  89
     INT. DANIEL'S H OUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

     Allie flips on the lights and descends the stairs into
     Daniel's sacred lair. She gingerly approaches his train
     town and flips the switch. His MINIATURE WORLD lights up.
     She smiles and notices an envelope leaning against the
     MODEL OF HIS HOUSE. It says: Allison. A TINY FIGURINE
     sits on top that he has made of Allison on her bicycle.

     She opens the letter; it appears a s though it was typed
     on an old typewriter. She begins to read. We'll recognize
     the writing as Daniel's VOICEOVER that opened the film.
                                                          102.


                             DANIEL (V.O.)
               Dear Allison, down here, in 1:87
               scale, the lovers always kiss, the
               neighbors are always kind and the
               trains always take you to the far
               off places you always swore you'd
               go. In life, of course, nothing is
               as nearly as neat and tidy.

90                                                               90
     EXT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - FLASHBACK

     Sitting on his porch, Daniel, looking older, pecks out
     the note Allison is reading on an OLD TYPEWRITER. Na than
     and Ryan sit on the porch swing talking.

                             DANIEL (V.O.)
               Everything I own has been left to
               Nathan and Ryan. Nathan has agreed
               to move home and be her guardian
               until she's off to college. He'll
               need help.

91                                                               91
     INT. DANIEL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Allison continues reading.

                             DANIEL (V.O.)
               Please help him, Allie. Molly
               always said Nathan was the best
               version of himself when he was
               with you. Who know s, maybe you can
               even get her into Stanford. Haha.
                     (beat)
               When we first met in that diner,
               you asked what my tattoo meant.
               "Amor-Fati" is Latin. It means "to
               love one's fate." Neither of us
               chose this fate, Allie. But
               perhaps we can find a way to love
               it. Fate has given me one final
               year with my son. He looks at me
               differently these days. Once in
               awhile, I even catching him
               smiling at me with a look that
               might just even be love. Amor
               Fati, Allison. Until we meet
               again, Daniel

     Allison is frozen.

                             RYAN (O.S.)
               Allie?
                                                         103.


     Allie whips her head around to see Ryan on the steps.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
               What are you doing? Come on
