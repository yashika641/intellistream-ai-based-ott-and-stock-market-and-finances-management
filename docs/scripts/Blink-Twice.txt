                     SLATER KING                                 
          I Slater King would like to                            
          formally apologize for my behavior.                    
          I've sought therapy, and am taking                     
          a leave of absence from my company.                    
          I'm sorry.

INT. INTERVIEW - DAY                                             

                    INTERVIEWER                                  
          You released that 2 years ago                          
          today. I'm sure a lots happened                        
          since then.                                            

                    SLATER KING                                  
          Yes, ma'm. A lots happened.                            

He shifts in his seat. He's nervous in a a way that makes him    
relatable.                                                       

                    SLATER KING (CONT'D)                         
          I like this chair.                                     

                    INTERVIEWER                                  
          Right. Well lets get to question                       
          that everybody is dying for you to                     
          answer. Where have you been since                      
          you-                                                   

                    SLATER KING                                  
          Got canceled?                                          

                    INTERVIEWER                                  
          I was going to say since you                           
          stepped down and made your CFO Vic                     
          Mahoney CEO of KING-tech.                              

                       SLATER KING                               
          Right.                                                 

He puffs his vape.                                               

                    INTERVIEWER                                  
          You completely vanished.                               

Slater laughs.                                                   

                    INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)                         
          What's funny?                                          

                    SLATER KING                                  
          People. They tell you to go away,                      
          and then they wonder where you've                      
          been.                                                  

The interviewer smiles politely. Waiting for him to answer.      

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)                        
          I just needed to disappear for a                       
          bit. So I-                                             
                       Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)             3.


                       INTERVIEWER                             
          Yes?                                                 

                    SLATER KING                                
          Bought an island.                                    

                    INTERVIEWER                                
          An Island? Well I guess thats like                   
          buying a sandwich for a                              
          billionaire.                                         

                    SLATER KING                                
          I know it sounds obnoxious, but Uh,                  
          Dr Stein, my therapist said it was                   
          important for me to have a safe                      
          space to uh, reflect. I didn't                       
          know where else I could I that so--                  
          Seriously I love this chair. It's                    
          such a good red.                                     
             So yeah, it's been incredibly                     
          healing to be in nature, and spend                   
          time with my friends, to just                        
          disconnect ya know? No phones, no

          chickens...                                          

                    INTERVIEWER                                
          Slater King raising chickens?!

FRIDA'S BATHROOM - SAME                                        

A piece of incense ash falls onto a worn book on the floor.    
"Success is the best revenge. How to build your empire"        

INTERVIEW - SAME                                               

                    SLATER KING                                
          Well yeah I've realized, after                       
          everything that happened, how                        
          important it actually is to stop                     
          and smell the flowers. So yeah,                      
          I'm grateful. For everything.                        
          Like... this chair. I'm grateful                     
          for this beautiful red chair.                        

He admires it again.                                           

                    INTERVIEWER                                
          I'm sure you can have it, if you                     
          want...                                              
                    Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                 4.


                    SLATER KING                                
          No. Really? (talking to someone off                  
          camera.)                                             
          I can have this? I'm love                            
          furniture, But I get it home it                      
          always looks weird,                                  
          yaknowwhatimean? I move it around                    
          like a crazy person cuz I never                      
          know where to uh, put it.                            

                    INTERVIEWER                                
          Right. So Last year you started the                  
          KING-TECH Foundation, in support of                  
          trauma survivors. What do you have                   
          to say to the people who called                      
          this performative?                                   

                    SLATER KING                                
          I guess, uh, I dunno, I'm just                       
          trying to do better. I don't know                    
          how else to say I'm sorry. I've                      
          said it so many times the word has                   
          lost meaning. I have learned a lot.                  
          I hope to continue to learn. I'm                     
          here to talk less and listen more.                   
          And yeah, sure I wish everyone                       
          could forgive and forget, but like                   
          my sister says, "forgiveness is a                    
          choice and forgetting is a gift."                    
          So yeah, I don't expect anything                     
          from anyone.                                         

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!!!!!! FRIDA JUMPS.

                    JESS (O.S.)
          Hey dude, you got my lighter?

                    FRIDA
          Oh, yeah, sorry!

Frida grabs the lighter from off the floor, She cracks the
door open to pass the lighter thru.

                    JESS
          The super should be here soon, Will
          you grab the rent money?

                    FRIDA
          Ok, we uh, might be a little short.

                    JESS
          What did you do???
                                                            5.


                       FRIDA
          It's a     surprise! For you!

                       JESS
          Oh boy...

Slam! The door closes. Go wide to reveal Frida is on the
toilet.

BEAT.

                    FRIDA
          Wait! Do we have any more--

Jess holds out a roll of toilet paper through crack in the
door.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Frida's washes her hands in the grimy sink. She turns off
the water, but the sinks still like- DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

She looks in the mirror. Fusses with her hair. We clock A
SCAR next to her left eye. She REACHES behind the vanity
mirror and pulls out a small wad of cash.

She looks at her reflection. Tired. She needs a vacation.

                    FRIDA
          I need a fuckin' vacation.

                    JAMES BROWN
          1 2 3. Get down!


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

We follow Fridas' red backpack through the kitchen. The
godfather of soul blasts in her ear buds. A muffled voice:

                    ASSHOLE BOSS
          Frida...Frida. FRIDA!!!

Frida finally hears him. Takes out her earbuds

                    ASSHOLE BOSS (CONT'D)
          You're late.

                    FRIDA
          I know sorry I-
                                                         6.


                    ASSHOLE BOSS
           SO, as know the KING TECH gala is
          our most important event of the
          year, and well, last year you were
          a little too....chatty.

                    FRIDA
          No I--He started talking to me. He
          told me he liked my nails that was
          it--

                    ASSHOLE BOSS
          Anyway, It would be great if this
          time you could be a little more, ya
          know, invisible.

Frida nods. Turns to open her locker

                    ASSHOLE BOSS (CONT'D)
          Aren't we forgetting something?

                    FRIDA
          If I'm inviable why does it matter
          if I-

                    ASSHOLE BOSS
           If you're gonna difficult--

                    FRIDA
          Ok, ok, I'm sorry. We're good. No
          one's difficult. See?

Frida smiles.

                    ASSHOLE BOSS
          Just don't forget to smile.

Boss walks away. Frida smile drops. She gives him the finger.
Stuffs her Backpack in the locker.
      INT. EVENT STAGING AREA - NIGHT
R1A

      TRACK WITH FRIDA as she heads to some LOCKERS, passing
      between her co-worker buds, CAROLINE and BEN.

                             CAROLINE
                   You know what they used to call
                   that place?

      TITLE CARD

                             BEN
                   Yeah, and it was legendary and also
                   a million years ago.

      Frida drops her RED BACKPACK into a locker.

                             JEFF
                   Frida, you're late.

                             FRIDA
                   Sorry.

                             CAROLINE
                   All I'm sayin' is I don't buy this
                   whole fucking "my island is my safe
                   space where I learn to talk less
                   and listen more and think about my
                   soul." What do you think they do
                   on this "legendary" island now Ben?
                   Bring girls there to hang out and
                   play chess with them?

                             BEN
                   Oh, they definitely playin' with
                   they chess. I'm just sayin' he's a
                   billionaire. What do you want him
                   to do, take girls to Applebees?

                   How was your date by the way?

                   She was sweet.

                             CAROLINE
                   All I'm saying is, if you're at one
                   of these charity events, it's not
                   because you're a good person. It's
                   because you cannot fuckin' sleep at
                   night and you're trying to buy back
                   your soul, one five-hundred-
                   thousand dollar plate of Branzino
                   at a time. I'm just sayin'--

          I'm just sayin'...

                    FRIDA
          That's so cynical. You don't have to
          be a monster to have power. I'm just
          saying, I'll be at one of those
          tables one day, and it won't be
          because I did something horrible.
          And, by the way, I served him last
          year and he was very nice.

They laugh.

                    FRIDA (CONT'D)
          He said he liked my nails.

Okay. Go hang out with your     Yeah, tell him we say, hi.
best friend, Slater King.

Jess enters frame lugging a box of champagne.

                    JESS
          Do you have my lighter?

Ben hands it to her. Frida and Jess unload a dolly.

                    JESS (CONT'D)
          Missed that audition waiting for
          the super who never showed. So we
          still have black mold so I guess
          we're just gonna die now. How was
          your day?

                    FRIDA
          So, I've learned that when a client
          over fifty says they want to "try
          something young and fun" with their
          nails, it means you're about to
          enter a hostage situation.

                    JESS
          Rich people have no sense of time.

                    GARRET
          Yo Jess, can I grab your lighter?

                     JESS
              (hands it off)
          I want it back.
              (then)
          Gonna have to write my fuckin' name
          on this thing.

                    FRIDA
          Ugh, this haircut is stupid. I look
          like a boy.

                       JESS
          It's cute.

                    FRIDA
          Heard ya sneakin' out at like three
          am. Where'd you go last night?

Jess cringes, guilty.

                    FRIDA (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with you?

                    JESS
          Please don't be mad at me.

                    FRIDA
          I'm not mad at you! I just can't
          magically erase shit from my brain so
          when you get back together I'm not
          gonna pretend I don't want to stab
          him.

                    JESS
          It's complicated --

                     FRIDA
          It's not. Stop giving away your power.
          You're not a human phone charger.
          Have some self-respect.
              (then)
          I'm sorry. I love you. I just don't
          understand why you keep going back.

                    JESS
          I think I'm afraid of being alone.

                    FRIDA
          You're not alone. You have me.

                       JESS
          I know.

Jeff approaches --

                    JEFF
          Don't forget to smile, ladies.

                    JESS
          Anyway. It's tonight.   You must be
          dying.

    INT. THE DOWN TO EARTH GALA - BALLROOM - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON: An EMCEE'S FACE.

                        EMCEE
              Ok, ok, let's get serious, people.
              It is now time for me to introduce
              to you, your host. You all know him
              as the CEO and founder of KingTech,
              but tonight we are here for his
              exquisite taste and his boundless
              generosity. And it is my distinct
              pleasure to introduce you to Mr.
              Slater King.

    GO WIDE. A fancy fundraiser gala. The audience--celebs, CEOs,
    rich people (you get it)--APPLAUDS LOUDLY for: SLATER KING (a
    very young 40). He is handsome and charming and perfect in a
    way that should probably be annoying, but somehow isn't. He
    waves off the adulation gracefully.

    INT. STORAGE ROOM - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

    Frida and Jess struggle with CASES OF DOM. Frida cranes her
    neck, staring through the door at Slater, still talking.

                        JESS
              Careful, you're gonna sprain your
              neck.

                        FRIDA
              I don't care if I break it.

    She DROPS her case of Dom next to the freezer.

                                             TIME CUT:

    BACK TO THE BALLROOM

    A woman TAPS her champagne flute. A HAND appears--nails
    PAINTED BLUE, with NAIL ART OF CATS--starts to pour. Frida
    glances at THE BACK OF SLATER'S HEAD AT HIS TABLE.

    Back to Frida, the champagne flute is OVERFLOWING.

                        FRIDA (CONT'D)
              Sorry. Shit. I'm sorry.

      Frida opens her locker with the RED BACK PACK.

                    (to co-worker)
                Yo. Seriously?

      Co-worker tosses the lighter back.

      INT. STALL - LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

      Frida and Jess are squeezed into the stall. Frida reaches
      into the backpack--

                          FRIDA
                Red or blue?

                            JESS

      INT. LADIES ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      Frida and Jess fight the crowd of women for a spot at the
      mirror. Both in the same dress. Frida in RED. Jess in BLUE.

                            JESS
                Twinsies.

      NEXT TO THEM:   A BLONDE WOMAN, stares at her reflection.

      INT. BALLROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

      The gala is now in full party mode. Frida and Jess strut,
      lookin' good. Like, real good. On stage in the b.g., the
      Emcee is auctioning off a PIECE OF ART.

                    FRIDA/JESS
          Hi... Hello....How are
          you?...Hello, Ladies...

                     JESS
          Oh, she's gorgeous. I have one of
          those in my summer house, but I
          need more.

Frida trips in her heels.

                    FRIDA
          Oh, shit, sorry. I just don't know
          how to walk in these fuckin'
          things.

                     JESS
          Ok, do this thing my aunt taught
          me. It's easy. East. West. East.
          West.

                    JESS/FRIDA
          East. West. East. West.

                     JESS
          Oh, shit, it's Jennifer.

They strut towards a crowd of VIPs, but then--

                    STAN
          Ladies, this is a private area.
          Could you step that way please?

This is STAN (50, Slater's bodyguard, always nearby).

                    JESS/FRIDA
          South. South. South.

Frida stops, staring into the crowd.

                    JESS
          How much do you think that little
          head costs? Like, a million
          dollars? I wonder if an alarm would
          go off if I stole it.

Frida's off. Heading into the crowd.

                     JESS
          Frida! What are you doing??

Frida takes a few steps... then TRIPS... and FALLS... right
into a waitress with a tray of champagne. Record scratch.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)7.


Everybody turns and stares. Champagne and broken glass
everywhere. People are staring. Fuck my life. But then--

                    SLATER
          Are you alright? Is it ok if I help
          you up?

There he is... leaning down in front of her. Slater Fucking
King. He helps her onto a chair.

                     SLATER (CONT'D)
          May I?

                     FRIDA
          Yeah...

He slips off her other shoe... and SNAPS the heel off. She
smiles. They look at each other. It's an electric moment.

Big APPLAUSE. The winner, RICH --

                     RICH
          Slater!

                     SLATER
          Rich!

                    RICH
          The speech turned out great.

                    SLATER
          Really, you sure it wasn't too
          long?

Frida looks at Jess. Jess `slits her throat,' mouths `dead'.

Frida watches as Slater heads for the stage to take a picture
with Rich. Rich catches Frida's eye.

                     STAN
          Ma'am.

Stan hands her a BAND-AID. Her hand is bleeding--she hadn't
even noticed. She smiles. Under Stan's jacket, she glimpses:
A HOLSTERED GLOCK. Slater reappears with Rich --

                    RICH
          I'm sorry to interrupt.

                    SLATER
          No, no, you're not interrupting.
          This is... actually, I havent asked
          you your name.

      A beat, and then... she starts to laugh. They laugh together.

                Yeah, ok. Thanks Stace.

      Stacy steps away, quietly takes a little ZIPLOCK of SKITTLES
      out of her FANNY PACK. Pops one in her mouth. Slater picks up
      his jacket.

                Oh. "The island." Casual.

                             SLATER
                So casual.     It was nice meeting you
                .

      A pregnant pause. Neither of them really wants this to end.

                Alright, that's very cute. C'mon.

      But then, without warning. He's back.

      Frida, Jess, and Slater ride in the back, Stan up front with
      the driver. The caravan pulls up to the compound. Stacy jumps
      out, enters a code at the FRONT GATE.

      Frida catches the Driver's eyes in the rearview. He smiles.
      Stan clears his throat. The driver looks away. The gates
      open, revealing: the COMPOUND.

      The caravan continues through a dense tunnel of VINES budding
      BIG RED FLOWERS. Jess watches the gates glide shut behind
      them. They step of the cars onto an exquisitely manicured
      lawn. Those big red flowers dominate the landscape.

      EXT. COMPOUND DRIVEWAY - DAY

      Everyone gets out of their cars.

      The staff awaits them with trays of drinks.

      Vic puts on his FAVORITE HAT.

                          VIC
                It's good to be back.

      Slater tries out his RED CHAIR in the middle of the driveway.

                          SLATER
                I'm redecorating. You like it?

                             FRIDA
                I love it.

                          SLATER
                What do you think?    Is it too red?

      Eventually he lets the crew take it away and follows them
      down the path. Jess turns to Frida.

                          JESS
                     (sotto to Frida)
                Did we're really just jet off with
                bunch of total strangers.

                     FRIDA
           He's not a stranger. He's Slater
           King.

 Looming before them: the BIG HOUSE, early th century,
 colonial, antique and imposing. Surrounding on all sides:
 JUNGLE. The whole place conveys a sense of unpretentious
 perfection. It's... insane. Frida and Jess gawk.

                     STACY
           Hi friends!
                (trips a little)
           Godammit. I got it. Phones please?

 Tom tosses his phone in to Stacy's PINK TOTE. Vic rewinds:

 Vic tosses his phone in. Frida does the same. Jess side-eyes
 her. Seriously? Frida shrugs.

                     SLATER
           Yeah, you don't have to do anything
           you don't want to do.

 Jess hands over her phone.

                     SLATER (CONT'D)
           It's just, better without phones.

 On the steps of the Big House stands a woman. This is MAMA
 (70s, indigenous, with ancient eyes). She smiles warmly as
 Slater comes in for a huge hug.

                      SLATER (CONT'D)
           Mama!

                     MAMA
           Welcome home.

                     SLATER
           The place looks great. So much new
           growth.

                      TOM
           Hi Mama!

                     MAMA
           Welcome home, uhm...

                     TOM
           ... Tom. Mama, it's me, Tom.

                     MAMA
           Oh I know I know.

      Frida and Jess stare at A BASKET on the grass, filled with...
      DEAD SNAKES? Jess puffs a cigarette. Sarah approaches.

                          FRIDA
                Casual basket of snakes.

                          JESS
                Do we consider that a red flag?

                            SARAH
                Not no.

                          JESS
                So I guess we should ignore it? And
                like, date it for eight months?

      Sarah CHUCKLES, gestures for a light. Jess hands her a YELLOW
      SMILEY FACE LIGHTER.

                            SARAH
                Cute.

      Vic, passing Cody--

                          VIC
                Ok everyone say "makin' memories!"

      INT. FRIDA'S BUNGALOW - LATER - DAY

      Slater opens the door. It's elegant, minimal, perfect.

                          SLATER
                I hope it's ok. It's my favorite
                one.

      Frida sniffs the bouquet of BIG RED FLOWERS.

                          FRIDA
                I think I'll survive.

      They cross through the room. Slater twists the knob on the
      back door, and it sticks. He wrestles with it for a beat, a
      little embarrassed. Finally gets it open.

                          SLATER
                I keep meaning to fix that.

         INT. FRIDA'S ROOM - DAY
R18A

         Refreshed, having just showered off the gala and the jet,
         still buzzing from the Slater tour, Frida wraps herself in a
         towel, and JUMPS/SCREAMS: Mama stands in her bathroom,
         holding the WHITE DRESS.

                             FRIDA
                   Holy shit, you scared me.

                             MAMA
                   Sorry, I forgot.

         Frida clocks SNAKE TATTOO'S on her forearms as Mama hangs up
         the dress.

                             MAMA (CONT'D)
                   Red Rabbit.

                             FRIDA
                   Sorry, what?

         Mama pinches her cheek, smiles, flashing GREEN, VENOM STAINED
         TEETH, and exits. Frida takes a step and CLANG, trips over
         something.

                             FRIDA (CONT'D)
                   Wait, you forgot your --

         INT. BATHROOM - FRIDA'S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS - DAY

         Frida opens the vanity mirror. Q-tips. Tampons. Lotion.
         Electric toothbrush (from the future). A SMALL BOTTLE OF
         PERFUME - "Desideria". She SPRITZES it on herself. Delicious.

         In a drawer: a used LIP GLOSS. She opens it. There's a LONG
         DARK HAIR stuck to the grimy tube. She looks at it...

                             FRIDA
                   Better luck next time, bitch.

         ... And TOSSES it in the trash.

         EXT. BUNGALOWS - DAY

         Frida steps out her door to find Jess, smoking. They're both
         in bikinis, white linen skirts, sun hats, sunglasses. They
         look dope.

        EXT. PROPERTY - DAY
R22B

        Frida and Jess wander, not sure where to go. They pass some
        GARDENERS with baskets of flowers and weeds.

                            FRIDA
                  Excuse me? Do you know where we're
                  supposed to go?

        The gardeners just smile revealing STAINED, GREEN, TEETH.

                            FRIDA (CONT'D)
                  We'll figure it out. Thank you.

                            JESS
                  Is it weird there's like, clothes
                  for us?

                            FRIDA
                  I don't think it's weird. I think
                  it's just -- rich.

                            JESS
                  Right. So, you think the human
                  sacrifice is before or after
                  dinner?

        They look up to find CODY, walking towards them from across
        the lawn, holding a KNIFE!

                            JESS (CONT'D)
                  Frida, frida.

                            CODY
                  Sashimi at the pool.

                            FRIDA
                  Wait, where's the pool?

        He stops and stares at her for a sec.   It's weird.   He smiles.

                            CODY
                  Oh right, you've never been here
                  before. Sorry. It's straight back.
                  It's big, it's got water in it.

        Cue: Camilla, Heather and Sarah step out of their bungalows,
        all dressed similarly.

       EXT. POOL AREA - LATER - DAY

       CLOSE ON: RASPBERRIES being dropped into CHAMPAGNE FLUTES.

       Sarah hops out of the pool, sits next to Heather and Camilla.
       Heather's rolling a blunt.

                           CAMILLA
                 That is a fat blunt, queen.

                           HEATHER
                 That's why they call me the Fat
                 Blunt Queen. Who's got a lighter?

       Jess tosses over her lighter. Stacy passes, carrying TOO MANY
       CANDLES, balanced awkwardly.

                           SLATER
                 I'm good. Thanks Mama.

       Frida gazes at Slater in his chaise lounge. A waiter hands
       her a champagne with a raspberry.

       CLOSE ON: A SHARP-ASS ICE PICK hacking at a BLOCK OF ICE. Vic
       scoops some ice into a COCKTAIL SHAKER. Shakes. Calls to
       Stan.

       Vic drops an UMBRELLA in his drink.

       Heather slides into the pool. Frida looks around.

       CLOSE ON: Cody slices SASHIMI. He hands a slice to Sarah.

                 Mmmm. Cody. What in the fuck.

                           CODY
                 Bluefin. Belly cut. Best in the
                 world. Just melts in your mouth.

                           LUCAS
                 Whoa. Sick!

       Lucas picks up Cody's CHEF'S KNIFE. It's beautiful, ornate.
       Totally unique. Cody snatches it back right away.

                           CODY
                 Hey! You don't touch my dick, you
                 don't touch my knife. Get it?

         A WAITER hands Frida and Jess fresh champagnes with
         raspberries.

         Jess plucks out her raspberry. Tries to cheers Frida with it,
         but Frida's attention is on Slater, swimming past.

                             SLATER
                   You two ok? Having a good time?

                             FRIDA
                   We're having a great time.

         Jess pops her raspberry in her mouth.

         Slater smiles, lifts himself out of the pool. Frida watches
         as he walks away, settles into a lounge chair.

         EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

         Camilla steps into the pool, puffing the blunt. Tom is there,
         staring up into the sky. She follows his gaze. He points:

                             TOM
                   There's the head. Arms. Little
                   buttons. One two three. Gingerbread
                   man. See it?

                             CAMILLA
                   Aww yeah. Let's find him a cute
                   little house.

         She searches the sky, puffs the blunt.

         Frida is still staring at Slater, lazing in his lounge chair.
         He vapes, catches her eye. They look at each other.

                   Think fast!

         Slater turns just in time to catch a FLYING COCONUT.

                              LUCAS
                   Whoa!

         Sarah hangs precipitously from a TREE -- total daredevil.

                             SLATER
                   Well look at you.

         Sarah jumps gracefully out of the tree.

                             CAMILLA
                   Go off, HSB!!!

                   She was on Hot Survivor Babes.

         Sarah takes the coconut out of Slater's hands.

                   Season eighteen.

                             SARAH
                   They edit out a lot.

         Sarah grabs Cody's special knife off his tray, goes to hack
         off the top of the coconut. Cody squirms.

                             SARAH (CONT'D)
                   I did what I had to do to survive.

         Sarah swings-- WHACK! The coconut top pops off. She slips a
         straw in. Cody inspects his knife with great concern.

         Sarah sips the coconut suggestively, offers it to Slater. He
         takes a sip. Smiles at her.

         Suddenly, COUGH - Oh no, Frida's choking. Slater runs over.

        Frida COUGHS, spits the raspberry out, looks up at Slater.


        EXT. PATH - DAY
R26F

        Frida looks over to find Slater, just down the path. Some
        GARDENERS approach with LARGE BASKETS OF FLOWERS. Slater says
        "hi guys," steals a flower, and offers one to her.

                            SLATER KING
                  Desideria. It only grows here.
                  This place is really special. The
                  people are beautiful. We're fully
                  sustainable. Everything we use here
                  is native to the island. The
                  fabric, the produce, got our
                  organic herb garden, got our
                  chickens. Cody's a great chef,
                  cooks all of our meals. Got our
                  cold plunge, the sauna's up and
                  running. That's not from here. So
                  yeah, a little slice of paradise.

                            FRIDA
                  This is not what I thought it was

                  sounded kinda fun.

                  We still do drugs, just with
                  intention. And we still have fun,
                  it's just different now.

                            FRIDA
                  I'm just saying, I know what they
                  use to call this place.

                            SLATER KING
                  Ah man, you must think I'm an
                  asshole.

                            FRIDA
                  No. I think you're a boy.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)19.


                     SLATER KING
           I was. I was a young, stupid, boy
           with all this money and power and no
           one gives you a rule book.

                     FRIDA
           Why would you want rules?

                     SLATER KING
           The world needs rules, otherwise
           you've got a bunch of traumatized
           kid with abandonment issues running
           around, actin' like psychopaths
           because they can't accept love. But
           that's not an excuse. A lot of
           shame. Shame's a big one.

                     FRIDA
           Hey, your life was bananas.

                     SLATER KING
           I'm figuring it out.

 They come upon a GARDENER wiping blood off of a MACHETE next to
 MAMA who picks up a lifeless SNAKE, rivulets of blood crisscross
 her fingers, as she drops it into a cloth bag.

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)
           Thanks Mama.
               (to Frida)
           Gotta bit of a pest problem.

 She smiles and waves at them as they pass.

                     FRIDA
           You call your house keeper mama?

                     SLATER KING
           It's her nickname.

                       FRIDA
           Oh, okay.

                       SLATER KING
           What?

                     FRIDA
           Nothing, just -- she's a real
           person who, maybe, shouldn't have
           to live with a "nickname" because
           her boss has mommy issues. But, no
           I'm sorry, I'm sure it's fine.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)20.


                     SLATER KING
           Oh my god, no, you're right. I
           thought we had a cute thing but she
           probably wants to burn this place
           to the ground. Goddamnit, I'm still
           an asshole.

                      FRIDA
           No, I'm sorry. I don't know why I
           said that.

                      SLATER KING
           No, you're right.
               (then)
           She left us with our dad, it
           totally fucked me up.
               (then)
           You in therapy?

                     FRIDA
           No. I actually think therapy's kind
           of self-indulgent bullshit.

                     SLATER KING
           You sound like my sister.

                     FRIDA
           I don't need to pay someone to talk
           about the time my mom tried to kill
           herself in front of me. I mean, who
           didn't have a fucked up
           childhood? I survived, I'm here.

                     SLATER KING
           Wow. I'm sorry. Well -- talk
           therapy isn't really for me either.
           Rich is a trauma therapist. So,
           more like, subconscious, repressed
           memories -- stuff like that. But so
           far he's just very expensive so
           maybe you're right. Therapy's
           bullshit.

                     FRIDA
           What can't you remember?

                     SLATER KING
           Anything before ten -- it's just,
           shooop. So it was probably pretty
           bad.

                     FRIDA
           I don't get it, why do you want to
           remember? I'd pay to forget.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)21.


                     SLATER KING
           I dunno. There's something
           unsettling about not knowing but
           maybe you're right, forgetting is a
           gift.

 She lifts her hand, touching her scar.

 CRASH, suddenly STACY is there dropping an arm full of RED
 GIFT BAGS.

                     FRIDA
           Let me help you.

                     SLATER KING
           Don't even try. She's got it.

 Frida goes to pick up a bag and Stacy shoos her hand away.

                       STACY
           I got it.

                     SLATER KING
           She physically can't accept help.

                     STACY
               (frazzled)
           Relax, you're on vacation. Oh,
           Slater, I had them put the chair in
           the new spot, hon. Let me know if
           you think it looks less weird
           there. I think it looks nice. I put
           the vape fluid in your desk. The
           new generator's not in yet so the
           candles are set up in the dining --

                     SLATER
           Thanks Stace.

 They continue down the path trailed by Stan.

                     FRIDA
           So, she does everything for you?

                     SLATER KING
           Yeah, she's my assisstant.

                     FRIDA
           And this guy just follows you
           everywhere?

                     SLATER KING
           Who? Oh, Stan? Don't even notice
           him anymore. Yeah, just in case.

                 I have bad news for you.

       EXT. TERRACE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR - DAY

       Heather and Vic play chess on a HEAVY MARBLE CHESSBOARD. He
       studies the position, utterly perplexed.

                           VIC
                 Something weird is going on here.

                           HEATHER
                 If by `weird' you mean `you're
                 losing', then yeah, shit's gettin'
                 pretty fuckin' `weird,' dogg.

       Vic studies the board. Heather takes a big blunt hit. She
       watches Mama walking in the distance. Stonily-

                           HEATHER (CONT'D)
                 What happened to your pinky?

       Behind them, on the lawn, Frida steps ahead of Slater, and he
       speeds up playfully. In a moment, they're suddenly racing
       across the lawn, laughing. Aww.

       Frida spritzes perfume, stares at herself in the mirror. She
       picks up a YELLOW TOWEL, puts it on her head, tucks it behind
       her ears like straight blonde hair.

                           FRIDA
                 ... I've aaasked Charlie to pull
                 the car around.

       And then, THE LIGHTS GO OUT. Frida, startled, looks around.

         They're all seated around the DINING TABLE. Everyone's
         laughing and talking. All the girls wear those RAW WHITE LINE
         GARMENTS. The power's still out; candles everywhere. A team
         of WAITERS stands behind them, PLATES in hand, like storm
         troopers in black suits. Cody stands.

                             CODY
                   Ladies and gentlemen, tonight you
                   have zucchini blossoms from the
                   garden, a yuca mofongo, also grown
                   right here at chez King, and some
                   absolutely beautiful dry aged steak
                   from the Mie prefecture in Japan.

         The waiters--sharply synchronized--place the beautiful dishes
         down. Frida and Jess gaze ravenously at the steak.

                               CODY (CONT'D)
                   Blessing.    Please enjoy.

         They all clap, start to eat. Yummy sounds all around.

                             HEATHER
                   Wow. Wooow. Cody. Wow.

         Tom has only a plate of PLAIN SOFT-BOILED EGGS. He eats one.
         Camilla eyes this quizzically, then digs into her steak.

                     I was gonna be, but of course after
                     twenty-two years, they just now
                     decide to notice that their show
                     about girls in bikinis fighting for
                     their lives in the jungle is
                     "exploitative." Like--

        Cody holds the cork to Sarah's face.

                     epiphany until after I've won a
                     million dollars?

         She finally sniffs the cork. Gives Cody a cursory thumbs up.

       They're all huddled around Tom. He's flipping through songs
       on an iPad.

                           TOM
                 I got it. I got it. I got it.

       He presses play. The song starts.

       The gang dances their asses off. Fun, crazy energy. Frida
       grabs a champagne bottle out of Slater's hand, takes a messy
       swig. They dance together. And just then: a SCREAM.

       They all run over. Jess is standing in the grass, terrified.

                           JESS
                 Something bit me!

                  It is venomous, but you're not

                  Look at me. You're gonna be fine.
                  It might get a little itchy. Maybe
                  a little fatigue. Drink a lot of
                  water.

        Frida inspects Jess's snake bite.

        Jess looks over to see Slater and Cody, huddled, talking
        quietly. Slater looks back over his shoulder at Jess.

                  Should I be like, going to a
                  hospital or something?

        FLASH! Vic snaps a photo of the champagne-covered dead snake.


        INT. JESS'S ROOM - NIGHT
R39B

        Frida, still kinda high, helps Jess into bed.   Jess winces.

                            JESS
                  I want my phone.

                            FRIDA
                  Okay, I'll go ask --

                            JESS
                  No, no, no. Don't go.

 Jess rocks back and forth, suddenly emotional.   Frida rubs
 her back.

                     JESS (CONT'D)
           This place is weird, I wanna go
           home.

                     FRIDA
           Hey, hey, we can't go home, that's
           crazy. We're on Slater King's
           island drinking champagne, eating
           amazing food, and we were just
           dancing with amazing people,
           nothing's weir -- oh shit.

 She looks up to find MAMA standing in the doorway holding the
 DEAD SNAKE.

                     FRIDA (CONT'D)
           Hi, we're just having a moment, do
           you mind?

                     JESS
           Do you want to continue your speech
           about how everything is normal and
           nothing is weird?

 They laugh.

                     FRIDA
           Nothing else is...

 She looks down to find the stain is gone.

                       FRIDA (CONT'D)
           My stain.

                       JESS
           What?

                      FRIDA
           Nothing.
               (then)
           He's actually really sweet. He's
           been through a lot. We have a lot
           in common. I served his table last
           year. I can't believe I forgot that
           he doesn't eat meat. Did I tell you
           he --

 Jess is now asleep, twitching.

 Frida sneaks out of the bed and over to the vanity, spritzes
 perfume, and quietly makes her way out of the room.

        OFF JESS, HAVING A NIGHTMARE, NOSE BLEEDING --


        EXT. LAWN - BONFIRE - NIGHT
R39A

        Frida approaches Slater who sips from a bottle of champagne, alone
        in front of the fire -- IN THE RED CHAIR! Vibe's a little dark.

                              FRIDA
                  Hi.

                             SLATER KING
                  Hi.   You came back.

        He struggles to refill the vape.   He's kinda fucked up.

                              FRIDA
                  Here.

        He hands her the vape and the fluid to refill it.

                            SLATER KING
                  Sorry about your friend. We were
                  all having such a good time.

                            FRIDA
                  She's fine. She's sleeping. We're
                  still having a good time.

                            SLATER KING
                  Good. I didn't want to scare her
                  but sometimes people have a bad
                  reaction.
                      (re: vape)
                  You gotta flip the --

        She puffs his vape.   Coughs.

                            FRIDA
                  What is this? Strawberry?

                            SLATER KING
                  Wild berry. Yummy right?

        She hands it back. He vapes.

                            FRIDA
                  At first I guess --
                      (getting the aftertaste)
                  -- but then it's kinda --

                            SLATER KING
                  I know it's bad but at least it
                  doesn't kill you.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)29.


                     FRIDA
           You never know what's in those
           things, man.

 Hands it back.   He vapes and stares into the fire.

                     FRIDA (CONT'D)
           So, watcha doin?

                     SLATER KING
           Thinkin' of lighting this chair on
           fire.

                      FRIDA
           Why?

                     SLATER KING
           Just tried it in like, every room
           and I cannot -- it just feels weird
           everywhere. This is a problem.
           This fucking chair is a problem.

 She cracks up.

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)
           It's not funny. I'm serious.

                     FRIDA
           I know. That's what's so funny.
           This is your biggest problem.
           Amazing.

                     SLATER KING
           I know, I know, you're right. I'm
           obsessing. I gotta get away from
           this thing.

 He crawls down onto the grass next to her.

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)
           It's nice down here.

 She stares at the empty chair.

                      FRIDA
           Uh-huh.

                     SLATER KING
           I asked mama her name.

                     FRIDA
           What is it?
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)30.


                     SLATER KING
           It's -- uhhh -- shit.

 They die laughing.

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)
           That smells nice on you. I like
           your nails.

 Frida smiles.

                     FRIDA
           Thanks. I do them myself.

                     SLATER KING
           What do we got here? Little blue
           cats?

                     FRIDA
           A-nail-mals.

                        SLATER KING
           What?

                     FRIDA
           Animal nails. It's kinda my thing.
           It's a play on --

                        SLATER KING
           Anailmals!     I like it.

                     FRIDA
           It's stupid.

                     SLATER KING
           It's not. You should Trademark
           that.

                        FRIDA
           I did.

                     SLATER KING
           Oh, okay. Someone's on their shit.

                     FRIDA
           I got into Haas.

                     SLATER KING
           Damn. Berkley.

                        FRIDA
           Full ride.

                     SLATER KING
           Wanna be my CFO? Pretty sure Vic
           only comes into the office to hide
           from his wife.

                     FRIDA
           I don't know if you can afford me.

 A SERVER delivers him a bowl of ice cream. He takes a bite.

                        SLATER KING
           Want some?

                     FRIDA
           What flavor is it?

                        SLATER KING
           Pistachio.

                     FRIDA
           Oh my god, that's my favorite.

                     SLATER KING
           Really? No one likes pistachio.

                     FRIDA
           This is scary perfect.

 She offers a spoonful. He just looks at her.

                     FRIDA (CONT'D)
           Enjoy the fantasy before it melts.

                        SLATER KING
           What?

                     FRIDA
           My mom always used say that.
           She could find the dark side of
           just about anything.

                     SLATER KING
           She wasn't wrong. Nothing lasts.

 She just looks at him. Then back to the fire.

                     SLATER KING (CONT'D)
           So why didn't you go?

                        FRIDA
           Where?

                     SLATER KING
           Business school.
PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)32.


                      FRIDA
            How do you know I didn't go?

                      SLATER KING
            You're doing nails.

                      FRIDA
            My mother. Couldn't leave her.

                      SLATER KING
            Couldn't or wouldn't ?

                      FRIDA
            It was a full on hostage situation.
            Never again.

                      SLATER
            Never again, what?

                      FRIDA
            Never again will I let someone
            else's suffering get in the way of
            getting what I want.

                      SLATER KING
            Rich would not like this.

                       FRIDA
            Why?

                      SLATER KING
            Because you're co-dependent and I
            have abandonment issues.

                      FRIDA
            Good thing I don't believe in
            therapy.

                      SLATER KING
            This will be fun. Or really fucked
            up. Or both.

                       FRIDA
            Or both.

                       SLATER KING
            Or both.
                (then)
            How'd you get that scar?

 Nothing.

                     Gotta go to bed, gotta to bed,
                     gotta go to bed. I'm glad you came
                     back.

        She watches him stumble off toward the big house.

                               FRIDA
                     Really?

                               SLATER KING
                     Yeah. Got therapy in the morning.

        She takes another bite of ice cream. Notices his VAPE on the
        red chair --

                               FRIDA

        He's gone.


        INT. FRIDA'S ROOM - MORNING
R60A
        Frida sits up in bed, looking at Slater's vape in her hand
        when she clocks DIRT UNDER HER FINGERNAILS. She crosses to
        the bathroom, washes her hands, looks back up to the mirror
        and jumps at JESS STANDING BEHIND HER IN THE REFLECTION.

                               JESS
                     Frida?

                               FRIDA
                     Holy shit, you scared me.

        Jess stares at her, strange look in her eyes.

                               JESS
                     What do you mean?

                               FRIDA
                     I just didn't know you were in
                     here.

        Jess looks around, confused

                                FRIDA (CONT'D)
                     You okay? You feeling better? How's
                     your hand?

                 Huh?

                           JESS
                 What happened?

                           FRIDA
                 Last night?

      Long pause. Then, Jess forces a smile.

                           JESS
                 Yeah, did you have a good time?

                           FRIDA
                 I had a great time.

      EXT.   BIG HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

      Frida walks up to the big house.

      INT. GREAT ROOM - BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

      CREAAAAAK. Frida opens the door, pokes her head into the
      Great Room. It's a big open space. A huge CLOCK FACE is built
      into the wall. TICK. TICK. TICK.

      Under the clock: the BIG RED CHAIR. Frida runs her finger
      along it. She sits. Puffs the vape. #BigDickEnergy

      CUE: "BLUES IN HOSS FLAT" by COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA. Frida
      pantomimes Slater - a very important man - ï¿½ la Jerry Lewis
      in THE ERRAND BOY. As she finishes--

                              SLATER
                 Frida. Hi.

      She darts up out of the chair.

                            FRIDA
                 Hi. Sorry. I... thought you might
                 want this.

      She hands him his VAPE PEN.

                           SLATER
                 Oh. Thanks.

                           FRIDA
                 ... Whatcha doin'?

      Rich enters from the back room with Vic.

                     VIC
           Aww, hi. Frida, Rich. Rich, Frida.

                     FRIDA
           I remember you.

 A beat. Rich cocks his head.

                     FRIDA (CONT'D)
           You were at the gala.

                     RICH
           That's right.... Amazing.

 Stacy steps out of the back room.

                      SLATER
                 (re: the chair)
           Hey Stace, it still feels weird
           here. Maybe we try it somewhere
           else.

 Stacy unlocks a BIG CABINET, pulls out her PINK TOTE. Takes
 out a PHONE. Puts the tote back in. Locks the LARGE PADLOCK.

                     STACY
           Ok well... We haven't tried the
           driveway. Or the bathroom. Ooo! We
           could light it on fire. That might
           make it feel less weird.

                     SLATER
           It's a process. We're gonna find
           it. Don't get discouraged.

                     STACY
           No no, it's groovy. Like... deck
           chairs on the titanic.

                     SLATER
           Don't do that. That bums me out.

                      STACY
           Sorry.

 She wipes a bit of schmutz off of Slater's lip. She hands
 Rich his phone.

                     RICH
           Alright, my man I gotta get back to
           the mountain top. Excited about all
           these new ideas.

                 How's Jess?

       EXT. TERRACE - DAY

       Breakfast on the lawn. The gang's all there, except Lucas.

       Sarah spreads jam on a piece of toast, takes a sensuous bite.
       A little jam drips down her wrist. She licks it off. Fucking
       yum. She glances at Tom with his PLAIN SOFT-BOILED EGGS.

       ANGLE ON: Heather and Vic, playing chess. A FAT BLUNT hangs
       from Heather's mouth. He holds his finger on his last move.
       Looks up at her. She shakes her head. No bueno, friend. He
       takes his move back. Heather turns to the others.

       Jess looks kinda haggard. Super dry mouth. She CHUGS water.
       She tries to spread jam on some toast, but makes a mess of
       it. Tom points at the jam, spilled on the table. To Jess.
       Jess chugs more water.

       Frida watches Slater across the table. A waiter pours his
       coffee. He puts honey in it.

                           JESS
                      (looking for her lighter)
                 I had crazy dreams last night.
                      (to Heather)
                 Do you have my lighter?

       A waiter pours coffee for Frida. She puts honey in it.
       Heather throws Jess the lighter.

                             HEATHER
                 Sorry.

                           SLATER
                 Almond or oat?

       Slater points to the waiter. Frida pauses, unsure, then...

                             FRIDA
                 Uhm, oat?

       He puts a flower behind her ear.

       Jess puffs her cigarette. Slater waves the smoke away.

                 You moved your knight.

                  bro, I'm not stupid.

                            VIC (O.C.)
                  My knight was there!

                            HEATHER (O.C.)
                  You think I don't remember where
                  your fucking knight was? You
                  cheater. You fucking cheated! I'm

        INT. SAUNA - DAY

        Camilla WHISKS a EUCALYPTUS SPRIG through the air. The gang's
        all in Finnish sauna caps. Slater waves a eucalyptus at her.

        Jess takes a cursory breath. She looks really tired.

        Vic pours water on the hot stones. Frida stares at his
        missing pinky. He notices.

        Jess CHUGS a glass of water.

                  Gimme your hand.

        She pulls a BALM from her pouch, applies it to the bite mark.

                               JESS
                  Thank you.

                            CAMILLA
                  I make it myself. Use it on my son
                  all the time. He's a wild one, just

                          FRIDA
                I used to do my mom's nails. It
                would calm her down when she went
                to the dark side.

                          SLATER KING
                I think it's working. No one ever
                takes care of me. Well, everyone
                takes care of me but only because I
                pay them.

                          FRIDA
                Well I'm here now.

                          SLATER KING
                Yes you are.


59    EXT. POOL AREA - LATER - DAY (FRIDA CUT OUT OF THIS SCENE) 59

      CLOSE ON: Tom's face. Long NEEDLES stick out of his bald
      patch like Pinhead. He looks more than a little wary.

      Camilla takes another needle from her pouch. Tom WINCES as
      she slides it into his head.

      Heather, Sarah, Jess, Lucas, and Frida hang nearby. Slater is
      noticeably absent. She looks over at the VAPE PEN on a table.
      A waiter serves champagne.

                          JESS
                Could I just have some water?

                          SARAH
                Hey hon do you have the light?

      Jess fumbles around. Can't find her lighter.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                You okay?

      Frida glimpses Slater in the window of the Big House.   Jess
      walks up to Frida.

      Frida exits.

                          HEATHER
                I just had the most craziest dï¿½jï¿½

                    What's wrong with Lucas? He's
                    acting weird.

          Jess CHUGS her water. Cody enters, mad, frantic.

                              CODY
                    Where's my knife? Who has my knife?

                    What?

                              CODY
                    My knife! I can't find my special
                    knife!

                              CAMILLA
                    Aye! Chill. You just gotta ask
                    somebody. Has anybody seen Cody's
                    special knife?

          She tries to offer the blunt to Cody. He waves it away.

                              SARAH
                    Nobody has your special knife.

                              CODY
                    What are you doing to him?

                     FRIDA
           Something horrible is about to
           happen.

                      SLATER KING
           What?

                     FRIDA
           When things are too good, that's
           when the bad stuff happens.

           When are we leaving?

                     SLATER KING
           Whenever we want.

           That's not an answer.

                     SLATER KING
           Okay, you tell me.

                     FRIDA

                       Slater?

          She looks around. Nothing. She hears something. Walks a

      REVEAL: Tom, a DICK drawn on his cheek. He is not amused.

                          CODY
                It's classic.

                          TOM
                Seriously, who did this?

      Frida's in struggletown. She CHUGS a glass of water. Jess is
      nowhere to be seen.

                          CAMILLA
                It's like someone is brushing their
                teeth with a lawnmower, but like,
                in my brain.

      Tom sits, grabs two SOFT-BOILED EGGS, eats them. Sarah looks
      rough. BIG BRUISE on her arm.

                          CAMILLA (CONT'D)
                You fell out of a tree?

                          SARAH
                That's what they tell me.

                          CODY
                You were like Dick Grayson.

                     HEATHER
           When did I cut bangs?

 Reveal: Heather, with bangs. She hits the blunt.

           Who's Dick Grayson?

                     CODY
           Robin. What's wrong with you?

                     TOM
           I have a dick on my face.

 Slater just looks at him. Tom shifts in the chair.

 Sarah eyes Frida. She looks like shit.

 Frida CHUGS more water.

                     LUCAS
           Greetings, excellent people!

 Lucas enters, greets Slater with a chummy shoulder rub.

                     SLATER
           Buenos dias, Youngblood.

                      LUCAS
           Ooh, fuck yeah, blueberry muffins!

                     CODY

           Spectacular.
                (to Frida)
           You try these?

 She eyes him coldly. He backpedals, sits down quietly.

                     SLATER
           How'd you sleep?

                      FRIDA
           Amazing.

                     CODY
           Alright kids. Sail's up. Who's
           ready to catch some beautiful
           grouper?

                 How do we feel about... less loud?

                           CODY
                 Sorry babe.

                            CAMILLA
                 I don't think I should be on a boat

                 Maybe we'll just have some girl
                 time. You guys go... with the
                 worms.

       Slater watches Frida CHUG water.

                           SLATER
                 You cool if I go?

                              FRIDA
                 Of course.

       He puts a flower behind her ear.

       EXT. SPA - DAY

       Sarah, Camilla, Heather, and Frida, all in BRIGHT BLUE BEAUTY
       MASKS, get foot massages. The girls LAUGH LOUDLY. Frida's
       hangin' on by a thread. She CHUGS a glass of water.

                           CAMILLA
                 I needed this shit.

                              HEATHER
                 Me too.

       She offers the blunt. Sarah shakes her head. No fuckin' way.

                           CAMILLA

                   I know. Someone tried to sue my
                   client over it. We won.

                             SARAH
                   You're a lawyer?

                                HEATHER
                   Allegedly.

        Sarah lights a cigarette.

                             HEATHER/CAMILLA
                   Bye `babe'!

                   It's almost like he wants me to
                   stab him.

                             HEATHER/CAMILLA
                   "Babe, why'd you stab me, babe??"

        OFF FRIDA, freaked out, we flash to --

        JESS standing in the corner of the room.

                             JESS
                   Frida, Frida.

        JESS LIFTS CODY'S SPECIAL KNIFE and then we're back to --

        THE SPA.

R88C
                   I need to talk to Jess.

        Blank stares all around. She itches her snake bite absently.

        A looooooooooong beat.

                             HEATHER
                   Who's [COUGH] `Jess?'

        They're all staring at Frida. She laughs. They don't.

                             FRIDA
                   Are you... fucking with me?

        Their bright blue faces stare at her, concerned.

                   Is she ok?

                  You don't look so good, mami.

        Frida's disoriented. The masseuse switches to her other foot.


        EXT. WALKWAY - DAY
R88E

        Frida looks over to find Stacy, fumbling more GIFT BAGS.

                            FRIDA
                  Where's Jess?

                  What hon?

                               FRIDA
                  MY FRIEND.     JESS.   IN THE ROOM NEXT
                  TO MINE.

                            STACY
                  You mean the storage room?

        Frida takes off.

                  Relax, you're on vacation!

        EXT. JESS'S BUNGALOW - DAY

        Frida, panicked, confused, throws open the door to Jess's
        bungalow: BOXES. FURNITURE. OLD TERRACE CHAIRS. Stacked
        ceiling high. No bed. No bedroom, and definitely no Jess.


        INT. FRIDA'S BUNGALOW - DAY

        Frida sits on the edge of her bed, IN THE BLUE MASK,
R80A
        disoriented and terrified. Looks up, suddenly remembering
        Jess, holding the knife, crying in the corner. What follows
        is a waking flashback that Frida experiences from the foot of
R60A
        the bed, looking back and forth between her past self (behind
        her on the bed) and Jess standing by her dresser.

                            JESS
                  There's something wrong with this
                  place.

                            FRIDA
                      (sitting up)
                  What's going on?

                            JESS
                  It's like no one knows. Everyone's
                  just laughing like nineteen sixties
                  fucking flight attendants like "you
                  havin' a good time?" "Oh yeah, I'm
                  havin' a great time." I'm scared
                  Frida.

                            FRIDA
                  Okay, okay, we'll figure it out.

                            JESS
                  We need to hide this.

        Jess disappears into the bathroom.

        Frida sits up in bed, looking at Slater's vape in her hand
        when she clocks DIRT UNDER HER FINGERNAILS. She crosses to
        the bathroom, washes her hands, looks back up to the mirror
        and jumps at JESS STANDING BEHIND HER IN THE REFLECTION.

                            FRIDA
                  You scared me.

        Jess, turns and looks at Frida, strange look in her eyes.

                            JESS
                  What do you mean?

        INT. BATHROOM - FRIDA'S BUNGALOW - LATER - DAY

        Frida stares into the mirror, slowly peels off her MASK.

        She SLAMS the vanity, screaming, an outburst of violence and
        utter frustration. She SLAMS the mirror. CLINKCLANK. Out from
        behind the mirror falls: CODY'S SPECIAL KNIFE.

        KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

                     SARAH
           I hear you and I don't want to
           sound like a bitch, but, it's just
           like -- I feel like I'd remember if
           there was a whole other person
           here. Ya know?

                     FRIDA
           She was here and there's dirt under
           my nails and I don't know how it
           got there. Jess was here -- she was
           here --
               (picks up knife and
                lighter)
           -- and she said something was wrong
           with this place but I forgot that
           she said that, but then I
           remembered and I don't -- maybe
           you'll forget me telling you this.
           I know this doesn't make sense. I
           think we're forgetting, like -- a
           lot of stuff. This doesn't make
           sense. Oh my god, I sound crazy!

                      SARAH
           How do we feel about putting down
           the knife?

 Frida does.

           No, but like -- I never know what

           Right.

              I'm having a great time here -- but
              I also keep having this feeling
              that I'm like -- not. Does that
              make sense?

                        FRIDA
              Yes.

                        SARAH
              I'm sorry, what's this?
                  (reveals bruise on her
                   arm)
              What's this bruise? What is this?
              They were like "Oh Sarah, you were
              climbing trees and you fell,
              because you were wasted. Uh, no.
              Because you know what, on the show,
              I climbed all the trees. Every
              tree. And I didn't fall. Because
              I'm a tree climber.

                        FRIDA
              So you don't think I'm crazy?

                        SARAH
              I think -- what's crazy -- is --
              that we got onto a plane with a
              bunch of dudes we don't know.

                        FRIDA
              Wait, I thought you all knew each
              other.

                        SARAH
              No. Cody chatted me up in a coffee
              shop. Talkin' about how he knew
              Slater King.

 They look at each other for a long beat.

           Of course they're fuckin' with our
           heads just like the producers on
           the show. Edit shit out and make me
           look crazy. Because that's what
           they do. They distract us with
           these cute little outfits, and they
           shower us with raspberries and
           champagne but we know what's goin
           on --
               (picks up the knife)
           -- they're trying to control us.
           They're trying to make us look crazy!

 Off Frida's look, she puts down the knife.

           Sorry.
               (then)
           So, they're making us forget.

           Yeah.

 Beat.

           Let's not think about that right
           now.

                  Yes.

                            SARAH
                  We need to call the cops and the
                  FBI.

                            FRIDA
                  I know where our phones are!

                            SARAH
                  I love that for us.

                            FRIDA
                  Yeah, but like... ok, let's say we
                  call the cops and the FBI, and are
                  like, "Hi, hello, please send help,
                  Slater King and his buddies-- whom
                  we met at a charity event -- have
                  been doing horrible things to us"
                  and they'll be like "What are they
                  doing?" And we'll be like "uhh, we
                  don't know, they've been secretly
                  erasing traumatic memories with
                  perfume!" And the guys will be like
                  `Whaaa? We would never do that,
                  other-white-men-whom-we-probably-
                  play-golf-with' And, you and Heather
                  and Camilla will be all like,`Huhh??
                  Nothing but good times and fat
                  fuckin' blunts over here, officer!'
                  And I'll be like, come on guys,
                  believe women, here's my friend's
                  lighter" and, they'll be like,
                  "sure, of course, and here's a
                  million dollars you fucking psycho."

                So wait, let's get on the same
                page. Your friend. What's her name,
                again?

                           FRIDA
                Jess.

                          SARAH
                Jess. Where is she?

                          FRIDA
                Maybe she got away.

                          SARAH
                Yeah. Maybe. So wait, you
                remembered. Your friend remembered.
                Sup with that?

      Frida moves the cleaning supplies and pulls out THE FLASK!

                          FRIDA
                She got bit by a snake.

                          SARAH
                What's in there?

                          FRIDA
                I'm pretty sure it's snake venom.

      Sarah shrugs, grabs it, and takes a nip.

      Frida shakes the COCKTAIL SHAKER. There's a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA
      on the bar. She pours out a round of BRIGHT GREEN SHOTS.

                          HEATHER/CAMILLA

                     SARAH
           Snake venom.

 A beat.

                     HEATHER/CAMILLA
           Ayeeeeee!!!!!!

 They do another shot. Sarah looks down at the pitcher.

                     SARAH
           So if this is gonna make us
           remember... what do we think is
           making us forget?

                     FRIDA
           No fuckin' clue.

 Sarah pounds a shot. Shakes it off. Haaaarsh. Stacy enters,
 scanning the ground.

                     STACY
           Whoo! Slam it girlfriend. Has
           anyone seen my glasses? I feel
           like I'm losing my mind.

 They're on her head (duh). Frida and Sarah exchange a look.

                     FRIDA
           Hey Stace, do you want a shot?
           A MOMENT LATER

 Stacy DOES A SHOT with the girls. And another, and another.

                             lookout.

                Frida starts towards the Big House.

                                        SARAH

                Heather dances past them stonily.

                "fat blunts" as loud as you can.

                CREEEAAAAK. Frida opens the door slowly, pokes her head in.
                The coast is clear. She takes a few steps forward. She
                SHIVERS -- the fresh shot of VENOM courses through her body.
                A DROP OF BLOOD lands on the floor. Her nose is bleeding.

                She looks up at the GIANT CLOCK - TICK TICK TICK - and stops.

                She lies down, arms behind her back. Her heart races as she
                closes her eyes, remembering........

                WITH HER FINGERS.

                BANG! Frida's eyes pop open. She GASPS, JOLTED from the
                memory. She's shaking. Her eyes dart around the room. She
                tries to breathe. Finally, she peels herself off the floor.

                HOLD ON: the blood stain in the middle of the floor.

      CLINK! CHEERS. Heather and Camilla drink and `AYYYEEEE!'

      A RUSTLING in the trees. Sarah JUMPS. She's tweaked out,
      paranoid. Her eyes dart around. She SLUGS a glass of water.

                          CAMILLA
                Yo. You got a little...

      Sarah touches her face. Her nose is bleeding. Camilla and
      Heather are pouring more snake venom shots.

                          SARAH
                Yeah, hey, maybe we should cool it
                with the shots. They're like,
                really strong.

                          HEATHER
                And I'm like, really hardcore,
                so...

      Sarah tries to grab the pitcher. Camilla pulls it away.

                          CAMILLA
                Whoa, how bout you just do you, ok,
                chica?

      Heather and Camilla do shots, dance away. Sarah closes her
      eyes, lost in a horrible memory. Tears stream down her face.

      Behind her: someone creeps forward. Heather and Camilla look,
      and GIGGLE. It's Cody, finger to his lips... shhhh.

      He GRABS Sarah, TICKLES her playfully. She SHRIEKS, flails
      and... CRACK! The back of her head CONNECTS with Cody's nose.

                          HEATHER / CAMILLA
                 / Brooooo!

      Cody's nose starts GUSHING BLOOD.

                          CODY
                Ow! Ow! What the heck?! It's just
                me babe!

      Sarah is practically hyperventilating.

      She SWINGS open the cabinet. BOXES. BAGS. FILES. A COUPLE OF

                See the little nose. Little tooth.
                He's even got a paw sticking out,
                see? It's a puppy.

                          SARAH
                Uhuh. So cute.

                          HEATHER
                Awwwww. I had a puppy once. He
                died.

                          TOM
                I'm sorry. Losing animals is really
                hard. They're like your family.

      Heather finishes the blunt. Ta-dah! Sarah smiles weakly.

                          HEATHER

      Frida's head SPINS around. She heard that one. Fuck.

      She frantically shoves the tote into the cabinet. She picks
      up the cardboard box, and the BOTTOM FALLS OUT -- spilling a
      bunch of POLAROIDS onto the floor.

      They're all pictures from the island. Tons of women, all
      wearing THE GARMENT. The guys are in some of the pics too.
      And a few other guys we don't even fuckin' know...

      The sound of WHISTLING outside. Frida freezes. Fucketyfuck.
      She cleans frantically, STUFFS a few photos into her garment.

      INT. GREAT ROOM - BIG HOUSE - AFTERNOON - DAY

      Slater enters, and STOPS WHISTLING, sensing... something.

      He steps forward, peers into the BACK ROOM to see...

81                                                                 81
      INT. BACK ROOM - BIG HOUSE - AFTERNOON - DAY

      ... Nothing. Nobody. Everything in its right place.

      He steps behind the desk, opens a drawer, takes out a VIAL,
      calmly refills his vape. He doesn't seem to notice: the top
      half of the Dick Trophy, balanced precariously on its base.

      As he closes the drawer, we see: a bit of WHITE FABRIC under
      the desk. BOOM DOWN to see: Frida, under the desk, holding
      her breath. Behind his feet, she sees: A BACK DOOR.

      Slater finishes refilling his vape. He whistles as he walks
      away. He's just barely out the door, when he stops, right by
      the BLOOD STAIN from Frida's nosebleed. Uh-oh.

                          SLATER
                What are we gonna do about this?
                What are we gonna do? It's...

      Under the desk: Frida's eyes go wide.... but then--

                work here. Right? Stace, is it
                weird here?

      Stacy looks a little... off. Stan steps out of the bathroom.

      INT. GREAT ROOM - BIG HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

      Vic DRAGS Frida into the room. She STRUGGLES. Tom stands
      nearby, casually munching an EGG.

                          VIC
                You could help.

                          TOM
                I'm eatin' here!

                          VIC
                     (under his breath)
                Someone's gettin' a dick drawn on
                his face tonight.

                           TOM
                What?

                           VIC
                Nothing!

      Vic RAMS his KNEE into Frida's back, starts to tie her up.

      Frida's POV: Heather, Camilla, Sarah, all tied up on the
      floor. Cody struggles to tie Sarah. He grabs her arm, hard -
      right where that BRUISE will show up tomorrow.

                          CODY
                Stop moving. Babe, just stop
                moving.

      SPLOOTCH. A gooey yellow glob lands on the floor in front of
      Frida. She looks up to see: Tom, YOLK dribbling off his face.

      Cody finishes tying Sarah and steps away, leaving the three
      girls bound and naked on the floor.

      The SOUNDS of a SCUFFLE, and then: THUD--A PUNCH LANDS.

      Vic reaches down and turns Frida's head towards:

      Slater, standing over JESS, bound and gagged on Tears in her
      eyes. She tries to scream when, in one sudden, horrifying,
      motion, he lifts her, snaps her neck, and drops her limp body.

      RESHOOT INSERT: UNDER SLATER'S DESK. Frida's eyes pop open.
      She GASPS, JOLTED from the memory. She has to cover her mouth
      to muffle her sobs.

      She steps away. He keeps staring at the chair.

                            SLATER
                Stan?

                          STAN
                It's a little weird.

                          SLATER
                Right? Ugh.

      Slater walks out of frame. In the background, Frida starts to
      creep quietly out from under the desk. But then--

      He crosses back. She DUCKS BACK DOWN.

      (CONT'D) SLATER
      Yeah, ok, let's just get rid of it.   Do you want it? Stace?
      You take it.

      Stacy nods, thumbs up, gulping water. Slater slumps
      dramatically down into the chair. Puffs his vape.

      (CONT'D) SLATER
      Oh! I'm an idiot. Stan, gimme a    hand.

      As they carry the chair across the room:

      (CONT'D) SLATER
      This is gonna work.

      Just as they set it down, a sound from the back room: CLICK -
      the back door closing. They look around.

      CLOSE ON: THE LIGHTER :) lighting the FAT FUCKIN' BLUNT.

      Heather hands the blunt to Sarah, who eyes it warily. Cody's
      right there. Sarah smiles... and takes a teeny hit.

                          HEATHER
                You didn't get any. Go again, girl.

      Sarah grimaces, takes a biiiiig hit. COUGHS.

                Oh.... Uhh... Yeah!

                          SARAH
                I'm just gonna--

      Sarah puts on a BIG FAKE SMILE, heads over to Frida, hands
      her the blunt. Frida takes it, confused....

      (CONT'D) SARAH
      It'll look weird if you don't smoke    it.

      Frida looks around at the guys. She copies Sarah's BIG FAKE
      SMILE, takes a dramatic blunt hit, COUGHS. NOTE: Frida &
      Sarah wear Big Fake Smiles for dis whole scene.

      (CONT'D) SARAH
      Soooo. How'd it go with the phones?

                        still smiling broadly)

           We did?

                     FRIDA
           Uhuh. She wasn't forgetting.

 FLASH! He takes the photo. Sarah hits the blunt. Heather
 dances over, hands them each a BIG RED FLOWER.

                     HEATHER
           Nostalgia for you. Nostalgia for
           you.

                       SARAH
           ... What?

                     HEATHER
           `Desiderium.' It means nostalgia.
           It's latin, bitches.

 She dances away. Frida and Sarah look at each other. Frida
 sniffs her flower.

           Mother fucker.

 They watch as Heather joins Camilla, Vic, and Tom. They're
 circled around Lucas, strumming the ukulele, singing fuckin'
 Joni Mitchell or some shit. Sarah hits the blunt hard.

 (CONT'D) SARAH
 This is fuckin' dark. [COUGH]

 And just then: an arm reaches around Frida. She freezes.

                     SLATER (O.S.)
           There she is.

                     FRIDA
           Heeeyyyy... yoouu. I... missed you.

                     SLATER
           Aww, missed you too. You guys get
           into any trouble?

                     FRIDA
           Oh no, just, you know, girl time.

 Cody pulls a BIG OLE FISH from a COOLER, holds it up proudly.

           Check it out, babe!

                     SLATER

 The guys grin, super proud. Sarah whispers to Frida.

      The waiters do their thing, perfect unison. The fish has been
      beautifully prepared, looks delicious. This is a nightmare.

                          CODY
                Friends, this is a really special
                preparation of grouper. It's
                poached in shoyu and young ginger,
                with local wild garlic. The
                artichoke and manchego croquettes
                are deep fried; which, I know, a
                little naughty. Those'll go with
                the yuzu and pink pepper gribiche,
                if you wanna take your tongue to
                tang town. And then there's the
                farro and kale with miso pickled
                asparagus. Blessings. Please enjoy.

      Everybody gushes over the food. Frida and Sarah, stoned and
      scared, nod like oooo... yummy.

      POP! Cody opens a wine. Holds the CORK out to Sarah.

      (CONT'D) CODY
      Chateau Montelena. Give that   a sniff.

      She sniffs, smiles weakly. He takes a teeny sip.

      (CONT'D) CODY
      Oof, it's gonna open up    beautifully.

      Suddenly: SLAM!!! Camilla POUNDS the table.

                           CAMILLA (O.S.)
                No!

      Frida JUMPS. Looks at Camilla. Is she... remembering?

      (CONT'D) CAMILLA
      (laughing, to Heather)
      ... Bitch that shit is too funny!!

      False alarm. Frida and Sarah exchange a look: Jesus.

      Frida watches Cody decant the wine. JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE -- A
      SOUND in Frida's memory. She stares, remembering...

      EXT. DINING AREA - FLASHBACK TO NIGHT   - NIGHT

      BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS flood the area. Frida is gagged and bound
      on top of the dining table, garment ripped open. STEAK BLOOD
      STAIN on her sleeve. She stares in horror at the hellscape:

      Cody has Sarah by a LEASH. He TUGS it violently as he rapes
      her. His CRUCIFIX JINGLES against his bare chest. JINGLE
      JINGLE JINGLE.

      Vic CHASES Heather through the grass. Heather SCREAMS in
      horror.

      Tom, on top of Jess. She's tied up. Her fingers claw at the
      dirt. Camilla, nearby, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER at Tom.

                          TOM
                Ask me to stop! Ask me to stop!

      Stan sits nearby, reading a book.

      Lucas appears. Shirtless, big RED FLOWER CROWN on his head.
      He sees what's happening. Shock on his face.

                          SLATER
                It's ok. Bring him over here.

      Suddenly, looming above Frida: Slater, and, oh hey, it's Rich
      The Investor Guy.

                          RICH
                And she really won't remember any

           You smell nice.

 Tom goes to take a bite. Stops. Looks at Slater.

           It's delicious.

 Tom puts the spoon down.

 Heather and Camilla are lit the fuck up.

 Sarah is in the middle of a nervous/stoned/terrified bite.

                     SLATER
           Sarah. How's your time been here?

                     SARAH

           hard time making girlfriends.

                     HEATHER/CAMILLA
           Awwww... / I'ma give you my number.

                     SLATER
           That's interesting. What do you
           think that's about?

 Frida gives her a look-- You got this, girl.

                     SARAH
           Oh. Ok. Well, I guess, women are
           taught to compete with each other,
           when we should be helping -- I
           mean, supporting each other. So, I
           was thinking when I get home that
           it might be cool to start like a
           program thing, where I teach women,
           I mean people--survival skills.

                     SARAHSARAH
           I know that show was stupid, and
           totally degrading, but I did learn
           some really useful shit. And the
           truth is... you never know when
           you're gonna be stuck in the middle
           of nowhere in like a totally
           terrifying situation with no one to
           save you and no one to even hear
           you scream and you need to fight
           for your fucking life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 A beat. Everyone looks at her. That was intense.

 (CONT'D) SARAH
 Cuz y'know it's scary... out there.

 Oh god. Frida glances at Stan, GUN visible under his jacket.

                          TOM
                It is, man. My cousin's wife got
                mugged last week outside a PetCo.

                          SLATER
                It's really amazing what women can
                do when they band together.

      Slater smiles, leans back, goes to put his arm around
      Frida... and she FLINCHES. Fuuuuccccckkkk. A long tense beat.

                          FRIDA
                Sorry, I just......

      The waiters take the plates, revealing: Jess's CIGARETTE
      BURN. Frida stares at it.

      (CONT'D) FRIDA
      ... wanna... dance.

      A song kicks in -- "AIN'T NOBODY" by CHAKA KAHN. Frida turns
      her flinch into a little dance move. She stands, spins away,
      catching the groove. Slater vapes, watches her.

      Sarah takes her lead, CLIMBS onto the table, slinks down
      seductively. The rest of the gang start to dance.

                          CODY
                Yeah babe!!

      Behind Sarah's back, she picks up the CORKSCREW, twists off
      the cork. She teases him, jumps down from the table. He
      dances up on her, trying to act sexy. (Friendly reminder:
      dude still has tampons in his nose.)

      (CONT'D) CODY
      Oh, you're a bad girl.

      She grins coyly. Yes, I am. Without breaking eye contact, she
      DROPS THE CORKSCREW into a POTTED PLANT.

      EXT. FRONT GATE - COMPOUND - NIGHT

      We follow Stacy down the driveway. CLICK CLACK. She punches
      in the exit code. As the truck pulls ahead, she plugs her
      ears, anticipating the HONK.

      The MUSIC echoes in the distance. As she walks back, CLICK
      CLACK, she reaches up, takes her glasses off her head. Puts
      them on. We see: her nose is bleeding.

        MUSIC is bumpin', everyone's feelin' it. Slater DIPS Frida.
        She LAUGHS, beams at him. Somebody give this bitch an Oscar.

        He pulls her in close, nuzzles into her neck. She SPINS
        away... He CATCHES her hand, spins her back, and leads her
        off the dance floor. Sarah, still dancing with Cody, watches
        as they disappear behind the cabana.

        Camilla dances wildly with Tom. She stops, fans herself.

                  Water!

        She heads towards the bar. Vic is there, looking in the ice
        bucket. Nothin' but water, and that SHARP-ASS ICE PICK.

                            VIC
                  Shit. Hey Stan. Stan the man. You
                  were in the marines, right?

        Stan looks up from his book.

        (CONT'D) VIC
        You wanna... get ya boy some ice?   Be a hero twice?

        Stan heads off. Camilla starts to pour water.

      Water OVERFLOWS onto Camilla's bare feet. We boom up to see:
      a POSSESSED LOOK in her eye. And OMG, her nose is bleeding.

                Are you having a good time?

      DRIP. A bead of sweat on Frida's brow. She twists her mouth
      into an eerie, forced smile.

                          FRIDA
                ... I'm having a great time.

      GULP. They stare at each other for a long tense beat. IN THE

      EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT

      Tom is on the ground, covered in BLOOD. Camilla stands above
      him, rabid, seething. She PLUNGES the ICE PICK into his
      throat, #BasicInstinctBitches. The others watch in horror.

      Oh, and the CHICKENS are everywhere. It's chaos.

      Slater tackles Camilla, struggles to hold her down.

      We follow Heather, walking slowly towards the melee. Vic
      turns around to see her staring at him. FURY on her face.
      Blood in her nose.

                           VIC
                Oh shit.

      He turns and flees. Heather CHASES him all the way to:

      Vic RUNS FOR HIS LIFE. PANTING, terrified. He TRIPS, falls

      face. He starts to turn-- What the fu--

      BLAM!! The HEAVY MARBLE CHESS BOARD SMASHES Vic in the face
      and he goes down. BLAM! She hits him again. Ouch.

      Heather lifts the board.... This time for the kill......
      BANG! The bullet slams into her temple. She crumples.

      EXT. POOL AREA - SAME - NIGHT

      Slater still struggles to contain Camilla. Cody steps slowly
      towards Sarah. She backs away, right by the POTTED PLANT.

                          CODY
                Babe. Babe. We can talk about this.

      Sarah reaches into the plant, comes out with the CORKSCREW.
      She SWIPES at him expertly.

      (CONT'D) CODY
      Whoa! Babe!

      She JABS the corkscrew - GSSHHH - it sticks right THROUGH HIS
      HAND and stays there.

                          SARAH
                That's gonna open up beautifully.

      He SCREAMS, grabs a DECK CHAIR, HURLS it. She DUCKS, swings a
      ROUNDHOUSE KICK to his abdomen and he topples into the pool.

      Camilla gets her hand free, reaches into her POUCH, STABS
      Slater in the cheek with a BUNDLE OF ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES.
      Slater WINCES, pulls the needles out, pins her arms down
      violently. Stan appears.

                          STAN
                You got her?

                             SLATER
                I got her.

      Slater looks around at the chaos. Yep. The fucking Stepford
      Wives are waking up, and they want blood.

      Frida and Slater lock eyes across the pool. She backs away.
      Stan breaks into a Terminator run. She flees into the trees.

      Frida tears through dense trees; heart POUNDING.

      SUDDENLY: WHITE FLOOD LIGHTS. EVERYWHERE. Blinding. She looks
      back. Stan is catching up.

      We stay with Stan for a beat as he tears through the brush.
      He loses sight of Frida. He speeds up.

      Frida--hidden behind a tree--hears him run past. She waits,
      starts to crawl.... SNAP! A branch breaks under her hand.
      Fuck. She peeks around. Nothing. Turns back to see: BLACK
      BOOTS, right in front of her face. She looks up.

                           STAN
                Ma'am.

      She tries to get away; he YANKS her upright, twists her arm
      back like a cop. She YAWLPS in pain. He shoves his gun into
      the back of her head.

      Behind them, Sarah creeps out of the darkness towards them,
      holding a LARGE ROCK. Stan senses her just at the last
      moment, spins around. BANG! He gets a shot off and they BOTH
      fall to the ground.

      A beat, and then: Sarah stands, the blood-covered rock in her
      hand. Blood gushes from Stan's head. She tosses the rock
      aside, picks up the GLOCK.

                          SARAH
                ... This place sucks.

      They walk away into the mist. It's giving Casablanca.

      The DOOR bursts open. Slater and Cody carry Camilla, bound
      and SCREAMING. Lucas enters, propping up Vic. Vic looks
      fucking baaad; GROANING, his jaw barely attached to his face.

      Slater and Cody drop Camilla on the floor of the back room.

                           CODY
                This is bad. This is bad. Oh, this

           What does he mean????

 Slater hands them both whiskeys. Cody eyes it sadly.

           What is it?

       An ear-piercing SCREEEAAAAAM from Camilla. Slater calmly
       walks over, STEPS ON HER THROAT, holds it down as hard as he
       can. She struggles.... and finally goes limp.

       Sarah pops the glock clip out. Checks the rounds. SNAPS it
       shut. She stalks down the path after Cody.

       Frida runs for the bathroom, TRIPS, falls. Mama's basket of
       cleaning supplies. Goddamit.

       The POLAROIDS have spilled out of her garment. One catches
       her eye. She looks, stands, steps into the bathroom. Holds it
       up in the moonlight... and her face goes white.

                           FRIDA
                 ... Red rabbit...

       Behind her, in the mirror: a FIGURE. Frida spins around: It's
       Stacy, standing in the doorway.

                           STACY
                 I don't... understand....

       Stacy's eyes are red from crying. Frida steps towards her.

                 But I didn't...

       Frida takes another step, puts her hand on Stacy's shoulder.


                 (CONT'D) STACY
                 I didn't want... to REMEMBER!!!!!!!

       Stacy grabs Frida, BASHES her face into the mirror.


                 (CONT'D) STACY
                 Do you like this? Do you like being
                 a victim? They're gonna do what
                 they're gonna do. You child. Do you
                 think we bent over and took it
                 because we're a bunch of idiots?
                 You think you're special? You're
                 the idiots.

       She SLAMS Frida's head into the mirror. We hear: CLINKCLINK.


                 (CONT'D) STACY
                 Forgetting is a gift, hon.

       Frida's hand darts out, GRABS the PERFUME BOTTLE...

                           FRIDA
                 Well then merry fucking Christmas!

       Frida SWINGS the bottle. Stacy CATCHES her arm. Damn. Frida
       KNEES her in the crotch. Stacy recoils in pain. Frida TACKLES
       her onto the ground, SCRAMBLES over her into the bedroom --

       ZZZZIP, and ZZZZZZZZAPP! Frida's body seizes up and she DROPS
       like a stone. THUDDD. REVEAL: Stacy, holding a TASER GUN. She
       deposits it back into her fanny pack. ZZZZZZZIP.

                 Who's there?

       He turns back around to see: Sarah. His eyes go wide.

                           SARAH
                 It's just me babe.

       BANG! A GUNSHOT in the distance. Stacy turns, goes to the
       door, leaving Frida paralyzed on the floor. Stacy peers into
       the darkness. Nothing. She turns back... and Frida is gone.

       A SOUND in the bathroom. She creeps forward. CLICK-CLACK.

                 Look. Hon. I'm sorry. I know this
                 vacation isn't going the way you
                 wanted it to, but--

       Frida comes SCREAMING out of the shower with the SPECIAL
       KNIFE. Jabs it GSSSSSHHHH! straight into Stacy's jugular.

       Stacy crumples to the ground. Blood GUSHES from her neck.
       Skittles all over the floor.

                           FRIDA
                 ... Bitch, I tried.

       Frida pulls out the knife, looks down at it, then at the
       vanity. Under her breath:

       (CONT'D) FRIDA
       `Check your vanity'.....

       Laughter and tears come all together. Oh, Jess.....

       (CONT'D) FRIDA

       Frida steps out, SPECIAL KNIFE in hand... to find: Sarah, GUN
       in hand. They're both covered in blood. Sarah looks at
       Stacy's corpse on the bathroom floor.

                           FRIDA
                 Found a weapon.

                           SARAH
                 ... Not no.

       Frida picks up the POLAROID, hands it to Sarah.

                 But this is impossible, unless...

       CLOSE ON: The PHOTO: Hannah Marshall smiling by the pool.
       Next to her: Frida. Her hair is LONG, and her NAILS are
       painted RED, with little nail art of RABBITS.

                           FRIDA
                 ... I've been here before.

                           SARAH
                 Uhm. What should we do?

       Frida steps to the bed, runs her fingers along those thousand-
       and-twenty-threadcount white sheets. She balls the sheet in
       her fist.... and then uses it to wipe Stacy's blood off the
       knife. She turns back to Sarah.

                           FRIDA
                 Let's go say hi to the guys.

       INT. BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

       Slater pours himself another whiskey, refills Lucas's glass.
       Lucas stares at Camilla's dead body. Slater sits, vapes.

                           LUCAS
                 What did I do?

                            SLATER
                 Nothing.

                           LUCAS
                 Why didn't I stop you?

       Slater shrugs you tell me. Distress on Lucas's face.

                           SLATER
                 You mad at me?

                           LUCAS
                 I'm scared.

                           SLATER
                 Good. That's good. Honest.

       THUMP THUMP THUMP! POUNDING on the door.

                           FRIDA (O.S.)
                 Slater? It's Frida! I don't know
                 what's going on! Please let me in!!

       Lucas stands.

                           SLATER
                 She's mad. They're always mad.

       THUMP THUMP THUMP!

                           FRIDA (O.S.)
                 Slater! Please!!!

       A beat. And then..... Lucas HURLS his WHISKEY GLASS, BOLTS
       for the door. Slater ducks-- the glass SHATTERS behind him.
       Lucas TWISTS the knob, SWINGS the door open --

       BANG!!!! Blood SPLATTERS from Lucas's head and he goes down.

       Slater moves fast, PUSHES Lucas's body out of the way. Frida,
       outside, SWINGS the knife wildly through the open door. He
       DUCKS, using the door as a shield. He SLAMS it on her arm.
      PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)83.


       She drops the knife. CLINKCLINK. He reaches out, grabs her
       hair, pulls her inside. SLAMS the door shut.

       CUT TO: Sarah, on the lawn, gun trained on the action.
       Dammit.

       INT. BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

       Frida backs away. Slater steps forward.

                            SLATER
                 ... Hi.

                            FRIDA
                 Hi.

       She's terrified, crying, pleading. She backs into the back
       room, against the desk. He steps up, real close.

                           SLATER
                 Is it funny yet?

       She reaches back, grabbing: THE BROKEN TIP OF THE PILLAR OF
       INTEGRITY TROPHY. She SWINGS. WHAM! Right in the head.

                           FRIDA
                 Gettin' there.

       WHAM! She hits him again. He reels backwards into the great
       room. For a moment, in his field of vision: THE BIG RED
       CHAIR. He cocks his head. His face covered in blood.

       WHAM WHAM. Finally, he grabs her arm. TWISTS her wrist. She
       drops the trophy.

       He SLAMS her into the CABINET. The doors fly open. She SLAMS
       HIM into the wall. HURLS the CARDBOARD BOX at him. Polaroids
       fly everywhere. He's disoriented. She LUNGES for the KNIFE,
       but then... TRIPS over Camilla's body. Oh come on!

       He scrambles on top of her, GRABS her head and SMASHES it
       into the floor and Frida BLACKS THE FUCK OUT.

       INT. BATHROOM - FRIDA'S BUNGALOW - FLASHBACK - DAY

       She slams into the vanity, knocking over her TUBE OF LIP
       GLOSS. Grabs a YELLOW TOWEL.

       CLOSE ON: the lip gloss, rolling into the bedroom. In the
       b.g., Frida wraps the towel around her hand. She PUNCHES out
       the bathroom window. Hoists herself through...

       EXT. JUNGLE PATH - FLASHBACK - DAY

       Frida's BLOODY FEET run past the BROKEN STONE WALL. Aha:
       We've seen this moment this before. Way back on page

       She runs, top speed..... then slows... And stops. A confused
       look on her face. She looks around. Why was I running?

       She turns back. He's just standing there, smiling......

                            SLATER
                 Hi.

                            FRIDA
                 Hi.

       She walks over to him. Behind him... Hannah Marshall... bound
       and gagged. Oh, THAT'S why I was running... She SCREAMS,
       tries to get away. But suddenly-- her arms FLY back
       violently, as Slater grabs the DRAWSTRING of her GARMENT.

       She tips forward. THONK--her forehead hits a STONE. Blood
       trickles into her eyes. So that's how she got that scar.

       Stillness for a beat. Our LIZARD watches from its tree.

       Suddenly she's JERKED backwards. Slater expertly ties Frida's
       sleeves together, bends her legs back, binding her ankles
       with the drawstring in a horrifying cocoon. And that's what
       these things are really for. He flips her onto her back.

                           SLATER
                 Hey. What do you call a cow with no
                 legs?

       Frida looks at him... and then starts to LAUGH at the
       familiar joke. She's already forgotten....

           Frida gasps BACK TO PRESENT, now bound by the garment. Slater
           is seated in the big red chair (now in a different spot). He
           looks down at her, shakes his head in genuine admiration.

                               SLATER
                     Man... you always find a way to get
                     into the party.

           Frida glares up at him. Her face is bloody.

           On the side table: the VAPE and THE KNIFE. He picks up the
           vape, tries to puff, but it's empty. He refills it calmly.

           BEHIND FRIDA'S BACK: Her fingers feel around on the floor...
           finally finding: a SHARD OF LUCAS's WHISKEY GLASS. BINGO.

                 sippin' green juice an mimosas in a

                 know what's not real? Forgiveness.
                 I Slater King, formally apologize.
                 I've sought therapy and I plan to
                 take a leave of absence from my
                 company and to deal with this issue
                 head on. Blah, blah, blah, sorry
                 sorry, sorry, SORRY! So, We good?

                 There is no forgiveness. There's
                 only forgetting. Which you're
                 incredible at by the way. You
                 forgot the entire place. I didn't
                 know it could do that. I mean, this
                 is amazing. You're amazing. You
                 inspire me! You make me think
                 bigger. Imagine what humans can do
                 if we were just free from our
                 trauma. Oh, this is gonna be great.
                 Like, my sister. She's so fucked

                 know this was never about sex
                 right? This is about creating a
                 safe space. Where we can learn

                 fresh. What do ya think?

       BANG!!!! Gunshot outside. Slater FLINCHES. Frida's eyes dart
       towards the BULLET, lodged in the steel-reinforced door.

       INTERCUT - INT. BIG HOUSE / EXT. BIG HOUSE

       BANG! Another bullet lodges itself in the door.

       BANG! Another bullet in the door.

       OUTSIDE

       Sarah KICKS at the door. It doesn't budge.

       INSIDE

                           SLATER KING
                 Hold that thought. I'll be right
                 back. I really want to hear what
                 you have to say. I'll be right
                 back.

       EXT. BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

       Slater explodes out of the door. Sarah has a head start, but
       dude's fucking FAST. She disappears behind some trees.

122                                                              122
       EXT. JUNGLE PATH - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

       Slater turns the corner, but Sarah is nowhere in sight.

123                                                              123

       Slater opens the door of the sauna. No Sarah.

       EXT. COLD PLUNGE - NIGHT

       He spots... something... sticking out behind a bush. Gotcha.
       He inches forward... whips around the corner... to find...
       CODY'S CORPSE, shot through the heart. (We know you're
       wondering, so yes: he still has tampons in his nose.)

       BLOOP. Water. Nearby. Slater steps towards the COLD PLUNGE.
       The water moves, ever so slightly.

125                                                              125
       EXT. UNDER THE WATER - COLD PLUNGE - NIGHT

       Sarah, submerged in the freezing water, holding her breath.

       SPLSSHHH! A HAND reaches down and GRABS her by the hair. She
       SCREAMS under the water.

       INT. BIG HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

       Slater bursts in, dragging a soaking/freezing/SHRIEKING
       Sarah, hogtied in the garment. He HURLS her to the ground.

       Frida--feet still bound but hands now free--has made her way
       over to the side table.

       She GRABS THE KNIFE, swings it towards him, defensive. The
       VAPE rolls off the table... on the floor, right to Slater's
       feet. He picks it up. Walks over to Frida. She's weak, barely
       able to hold the knife. He takes it out of her hand easily.

                           SLATER
                 Don't worry. I'm not gonna kill
                 you. You're like my best friend.

       Vic GURGLES. Slater walks back to Sarah. Vic GRUNTS again,
       louder. Did he say "don't?"........ Slater puffs his vape.

       He pulls Sarah's head up by the hair. Special knife to her
       throat. Frida and Sarah lock eyes. And then... Slater COUGHS.

       He stands. Drops the knife. He looks around, uncertain. Then:

       (CONT'D) SLATER
       I just want to say, I really do think it's amazing what
       women can do when they band together. COUGH. Excuse me.
       COUGH. Excuse me. Oh my god, what happened to Vic!?!

       He backpedals, and TRIPS over Camilla's body, falls over
       backwards, knocking LIT CANDLES all over the floor.

       He stands, looks around. Confused. Another vape pull.

       (CONT'D) SLATER
       Oh my god, what happened to Vic?!?

       He steps forward, STUMBLES on Camilla again.

       (CONT'D) SLATER
       Oh shit--

       He looks around the room like he's noticing all the dead
       bodies for the first time.

       Behind him, the candles have set the cardboard box on fire;
       and the polaroids. The flames spread.

       He COUGHS VIOLENTLY, looks at the vape in his hand.

                           FRIDA
                 You never know what's in those
                 things, man.
  PUSSY ISLAND - Kravitz/Himelstein 2ND WHITE REVISION (04/12/2023)89.


    He looks at her. She smiles devilishly... and opens her hand
    to reveal: A PERFUME BOTTLE. Oh shit: She fuckin' dosed his
    stupid fucking refillable vape!!!!!!!!!

    Suddenly furious, Slater LUNGES towards Frida, but he TRIPS
    on Camilla AGAIN, falls, hits his head on the corner of the
    side table. Ooohhhh shit the whole room is suddenly ablaze.

    The far end of Vic's couch starts to burn. The fire creeps
    towards him. He knows he's a goner.

                           VIC
                Gnarly.

    Frida struggles to untie her feet. The flames are growing all
    around her. As she finally gets her feet free, she glances
    over at Slater, out cold on the floor.

    She looks at Sarah -- tied up, terrified. They lock eyes.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. LAWN - NIGHT


Frida FALLS INTO FRAME NEXT TO SARAH WHO SITS IN THE GRASS.
They stare at the burning house. Exhausted. Holy shit.


                        SARAH
              (Putting a cig in her mouth.)
              Got a light?

Beat.
                            FRIDA
                  I knew I forgot something.


        They laugh. Not cuz anything is funny. But because they're
        still alive. And being alive is cool.

                            SARAH
                  (getting up)
                  Welp, I'm pretty sure I can figure
                  out another way to light this.
                  Since everything is, ya know, on
                  fire.

        She Looks back at Frida.
                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  You sure you know what you're
                  doing?

        They exchange a look. Sarah   nods. Walks off.

127

        The flames have spread to the rest of the house. Frida
        appears, struggling to drag a BODY along the ground.

        As he GASPS back to consciousness, we see: The body is
        SLATER.
        Slater's POV: Frida. Above him. Smiling. Backlit.

        Beautiful. CUE: "GUILTY" by Barbara Streisand and Barry

        Gibb.

        Nearby, on the --


        LAWN
        Mama cackles as she watches the big house burn. It's
        guttural and emotional. She walks away and we tilt down to
        reveal, SHE'S LEFT HER BUCKET BEHIND.




                                                                      128
           INT. THE DOWN TO EARTH GALA - NIGHT
 128
           Same ole' gala. One year later.



       Find: Slater's table. Everybody's laughing at something that
       he just said.

       ANGLE ON: Frida. We follow her through the crowd, flanked by
       bodyguards. Everyone moves out of her way, staring.

 Frida reaches the table, puts her hand on Slater's shoulder.
 Her nails are painted BLACK, with little nail art of RED
 FLOWERS. There's a BIG-ASS ROCK on her finger. She sits.

 (CONT'D) SLATER
 Sorry, I, uh....

                     FRIDA
           Eat your steak, honey.

 Slater takes a pathetic bite.

                      A VOICE (O.S.)
           Slater!

                     SLATER
           Oh hey. Glad you could make it!

 Oh hey, it's Rich, Slater's therapist.

                     RICH
           You're a hard man to reach. Been
           trying to circle back...

 Slater nods uncertainly... no idea what he means. He tries to
 puff his vape, but it's kicked.


           (CONT'D) RICH
           It's ok. We don't need to talk
           business here. Maybe we could
           connect next week?

 Frida holds up a VIAL OF VAPE FLUID. Slater takes it.

                     FRIDA
           We're in Beijing next week.

 Frida turns, smiles. Slater fumbles, refilling his vape.

                     RICH
           Oh. Gotcha. Hi. I don't think we've
           met --

                     FRIDA
           Of course we have. Hiya Rich.

 Rich's face goes white. He hustles away like a little bitch.

 (CONT'D) FRIDA
 Always a pleasure.

 Slater puffs his vape. Smiles vapidly at Frida.

 Frida looks up at the young waitress, holding champagne.

                       FRIDA
             Yes, please.

 SLOW PUSH IN ON: Frida, sippin' her champagne, as the
