CREDITS APPEAR OVER A RED B.G.


INT. FRUIT SHIPPING CO. - DAY - CONTINUOUS

STAIRWELLS

Once finished, the red swings wide. A door, and a young
woman in a white coat and hair net barges through it. She
rushes down a series of zigzagging halls, and then comes
to another door and rams through, slamming it behind her.

She hurries down some stairs, and then around the corner.
Steaming, angry. She comes to a white door and pulls it
open, and then darts inside.

GROUND CONTAINMENT FLOOR

She bustles between machinery, boxes, and identically
dressed employees. Her shoulders are stiff, and she's on
a mission. She ducks under a loading lift.

Back and forth between stacked boxes, she moves like a
mouse in a confusing blur. A man in a brown shirt and tie
abruptly runs to get in her path. The BOSS.

                           BOSS
             Come to my office.

He tries to block her from moving, but she ignores him
and continues on.

                           BOSS (CONT'D)
             I said come to my office!

She pushes him out of the way, and then ducks under
another loading machine and away from him.
EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM

She screeches to a stop at the end of a set of lockers
and sees a co-worker, a familiar colleague.

                           YOUNG WOMAN
             Did you tell them I'm always late?
                           BOSS'S VOICE
             That's not the issue!

The Boss enters as She gets in the co-worker's face.

                           YOUNG WOMAN
             Yes or no?

                           CO-WORKER
             I said it was `cause of the bus.
                                                         2.
                        BOSS
          That's not important. Come to my
          office.

                        YOUNG WOMAN
          Why'd you say she said that?

                        BOSS
          That's not why you were fired!

                        YOUNG WOMAN
               (to co-worker)
          Am I a good worker?

                        CO-WORKER
          Yes.

                        YOUNG WOMAN
               (to Boss)
          Then why fire me?

                        BOSS
          Because your trial period is over.

                        YOUNG WOMAN
          Why me, if I'm a good worker?

                        BOSS
          You're the only one on a trial
          basis. Now change and come to my
          office.

She hesitates.

                        YOUNG WOMAN
          No.

                        BOSS
          Let's go!

She jabs a right fist into his stomach and pushes and
pulls at him.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Stop it!
She continues her attack. He covers himself as the co-
worker tries to pull her back. She swings and claws,
missing by inches.
The co-worker holds her, but She gets loose and charges
again. She swings and hits the best she can, while he
protects himself from the barrage of blows.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Leave or I'll call the--
                                                         3.
He feels a wound on his forehead as the co-worker gets a
tight hug on her. She struggles to get free.

                           BOSS (CONT'D)
          Calm down!

Finally, She gets loose of the co-workers grip, but is
winded and partly sobbing in anger. She paces back and
forth, not knowing what to do with herself. Thinking.

BACK HALLWAY

She bolts to a door and yanks on it. Locked. She tries
another. Locked again. She hurries down and around a
corner, and into a third door. Locked.

Around a divider She hits another, pulls its handle, and
it whips open. Just as it shuts a SECURITY GUARD grasps
its handle.

SECOND LOCKER ROOM

She frantically maneuvers between lockers like a stubborn
animal. She makes it to the back. Another locked door.

She goes to the locker area, only to see the Security
Guard boring toward her. She turns down a row.

He dashes around the row just as She comes around its
other end, and then runs back to the front area. She
quickly changes directions as more security guards and
the Boss close in.

She shuts herself in a locker.

                           SECURITY GUARD
          Open the door!

                        BOSS
          You have to leave!

                        YOUNG WOMAN
          You have no right!

                        BOSS
          You have to leave!

                        YOUNG WOMAN
          You have no right! I did my job
          well. Everyone says so!

                        SECURITY GUARD
          I'll force this door open!

                           YOUNG WOMAN
          No!
                                                         4.
In a slash the Security Guard tears open the door and
pulls her out. Both guards grab her, and she kicks and
flails.

                         YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
            Let me go!

She hits at them as they carry her toward the entrance.
She grabs the end of a locker, only to be ripped off it
by the Security Guard.

Grabbing and digging into anything she can, She puts up a
fight, but is obviously losing.


EXT. STREET - DAY

It's overcast as always. The young woman stands on the
sidewalk in a bargain brand jacket and gray skirt,
glaring into thought.

Her eyes beam a lifetime of hardship from her plain face.
This is Rosetta. Late twenties. She chomps into a waffle.
After a moment, she pulls out a old bike water bottle and
drinks.


INT. BUS - DAY

Rosetta closes an window in the back, and then sits. She
pulls open a tiny blue tie-sack that carries her
possessions. A poor girl's purse.

She takes out a paper towel and blows her nose, loud
without a care. She pockets the towel, and then takes
drinks from her bottle.


EXT. RUSTIC OUTSKIRTS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

HOUSE

Rosetta makes her way around a small yard, and then down
a graveled path to a wooden fence. She enters it.

BEHIND THE FENCE

She peeps through a crack at the bus, waiting. It finally
leaves, and then she opens the gate and goes out.

Avoiding cars, she runs across a street into the woods.

THE WOODS

She stomps through the weeds and brush a while, and then
stops at a buried drainage pipe. She pulls a large rock
off its top and digs out a pair of well used rubber
boots.
                                                         5.
Taking off her mid-top blue work shoes, she swaps, and
then puts the shoes in the pipe and re-covers it.

She continues to walk through the woods, on automatic: a
path taken countless times. As she approaches a fence
surrounding a graveled path and large pond, she looks
around, and then slips through a jerry-rigged opening.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta moves around a small brick and wood building,
passing used propane tanks up to its door. She knocks and
a dog barks.

                          ROSETTA
          Shut up.

The door opens. The MANAGER, late fifties and gray, looks
at her.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Any mail?

                        MANAGER
          There's a fox on the prowl. Don't
          leave food out.

She walks off.

LATER

Rosetta looks over as she walks past her trailer. She's
now in a dirty tank top, an old shirt, and has a towel
around her neck. She dumps water from a small bucket and
looks over again.

                        ROSETTA
          Why are you planting all that?

Her MOTHER, in equal ratty work attire, is mucking about
in the grass near their trailer with some flowers.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          We're not staying here.

Rosetta turns the lever on a small pipe by a grimy shed
and fills the bucket with water. She stirs it while
keeping an eye on her Mother.

She dumps the water and then something catches her eye.
Between the shed and a small fence she reaches in and
picks something up.

She stomps over to her Mother.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          What's this?
                                                         6.
Her Mother stands, ignoring.

                        MOTHER
          It wasn't me. I don't even like
          that brand.

                        ROSETTA
          How'd the cork get here?

                           MOTHER
          I don't know.

After a moment, Rosetta bends down and smells her.

                        ROSETTA
          You reek of beer.

Her Mother glances at her, and then continues working.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          He brought you booze so he could
          fuck you, right?

                        MOTHER
               (standing, insulted)
          That's not true. I'm your mother!
          Don't talk to me that way!

She tosses her gardening shovel and walks away. Rosetta
follows.

                        ROSETTA
          Swear it's not true.

Her Mother stops at the water pipe and cleans her hands
over Rosetta's bucket, which is quickly snatched up.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          That's my tub.

Her Mother flings her wet hands at her and storms off.

                        MOTHER
          Leave me alone.

                           ROSETTA
          Go dry out.

Rosetta dumps the water from the bucket and re-cleans it.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta scrubs her hair dry with a towel. The trailer is
short, and its kitchen is attached to a smaller section
that contains two beds across a walkway. Its only privacy
are curtains. Suffocating, claustrophobic.
                                                         7.
She takes notice of her Mother cutting a fish.

                        ROSETTA
          Where'd you get that?

                        MOTHER
          Someone gave it to me.

                        ROSETTA
               (stopping)
          Was it him?

                        MOTHER
          The people I pick up clothes from.

She walks over to her Mother.

                        ROSETTA
          You've been begging.

                        MOTHER
          They gave it to me!

                        ROSETTA
          Why didn't you say no?

                        MOTHER
          I don't turn down mending--

                        ROSETTA
          That's different! You mend clothes
          and I sell them.
               (a moment)
          Throw it out.

Her Mother gives her a look.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          We're not beggars.

Rosetta snatches the fish, but her Mother gets a tight
grip on it. They pull back and forth, neither giving in.
Rosetta claws at her Mother's hand, trying to peel it
away.

They grasp and struggle with each other: a fish in one
hand, a knife in the other.

She pushes and yanks back, knocking her Mother to the
ground, and then heads to the door. Her mother snags the
fish before she makes it out. Rosetta goes back, but is
stopped by the knife that her Mother points toward her.
Crazed. Rosetta stares at her for a long moment.
                                                        8.
EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta barges around the trailer and throws her Mother's
towel, and then rips the newly planted flowers out of the
ground one by one in a fit of rage.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta hurries toward another trailer, and then briefly
stops and looks behind her a moment. No one. She goes to
the edge of another trailer and digs into the soft dirt
with a spoon, searching.

She stands, and walks around a moment, scanning the
ground. She moves to another patch and starts to dig.
After a moment, she finds what she's looking for: a worm.

She puts it in a small tin case and grabs a few more. She
gets her small bag and then heads off.


EXT. TRAILER PARK OUTSKIRTS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

THE POND

Rosetta, wearing her usual attire, walks along the
gravel, carrying a plastic bag and periodically looking
around as she makes her way to the opening in the fence.

She briefly checks it, and then continues on.

Stopping at the pond, she pulls up a small patch of grass
and digs out a stick with a string around it. She pulls
it in, and eventually a bottle rolls to her feet.

She pulls it out and loosens a close-hanger wire inside
it. She opens her bag, takes out the tin case, grabs a
worm, and then hooks it.

Tightening the wire in the bottle, she checks its
strength, and then looks around.

She gently tosses the bottle back in the pond, and then
grabs another small stick and pulls it by its string.
Another bottle rolls in with a small fish inside.

She unhooks the fish's mouth, throws it back, and then re-
worms the hook.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta unlatches the stick holding the jerry-rigged
fence. She goes through it, latching it behind her.

THE WOODS

She hurries up the hill into the woods with her bags.
                                                         9.
INT. SECOND HAND STORE - DAY

The OWNER is going through clothes from Rosetta's bag.

                        OWNER
          Not this one either.

She puts it aside. Rosetta hands her a folded blouse. The
owner puts it aside, too.

                           ROSETTA
          Why?

                        OWNER
          They're summer clothes.

Disappointed, Rosetta hands her another article.

                        OWNER (CONT'D)
          I'll take this dress.

Another. She passes on it. And another, she takes it, and
then looks inside the bag.

                           OWNER (CONT'D)
          Nothing else.

Rosetta grabs all the clothes put aside and puts them
back in the bag.

                        OWNER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          That's four hundred fifty francs.

She comes over with the money.

                        ROSETTA
          You need a salesgirl?

                           OWNER
          Not right now.

She hands her the money and she leaves.


EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

STREET

She weaves between traffic, and then hops up a curb.

SECOND STREET

It's practically vacant. She walks down the sidewalk, and
then crosses the street after a while.
                                                        10.
INT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY

She stands at the counter in front of a pane of glass,
staring at a MAN behind it.

                        MAN (O.S.)
               (after a moment)
          Is that a cafe? A fairground?

                          ROSETTA
          A fairground.

He looks from his computer monitor, shaking his head.

                        MAN
          I can't put you down as
          unemployed.

                          ROSETTA
          I worked.

                        MAN
          Not long enough.

He slides her papers into the window tray.

                        MAN (CONT'D)
          Go to window eight. You may be
          eligible for welfare.

She grabs her things and exits the office.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Rosetta climbs a set of stairs, and then crosses the
street without looking. She's in her own head.


INT. SECOND HAND STORE - DAY

Rosetta enters, holding her bag of clothes close to her
chest.

                        ROSETTA
          Why won't you take them?

The Owner is sorting and unracking clothes.

                        OWNER
          They're out of season. I have
          dozens from last summer.

She moves to a different rack.

                        ROSETTA
          The whole bunch for five hundred
          francs.
                                                     11.
                           OWNER (O.S.)
             That's still too much.

Rosetta follows her to the front counter, and then stops.
She lets the clothes roll down from her arms.

                             ROSETTA
             Name a price.

No answer.

                             ROSETTA (CONT'D)
             Four hundred.

                            OWNER (O.S.)
                  (after a moment)
             Three hundred.

                             ROSETTA
             Three fifty.

                           OWNER (O.S.)
             All right. Three fifty.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Rosetta exits the store and walks down the side walk. She
reaches the end of the street and rounds the corner.

Stopping in a closed doorway, she sorts her money, and
refastens her small bag.


EXT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

She rounds a corner to a small, very used food cart with
an awning. It's a mobile structure, but this is its
permanent home. She goes to the counter.

                           ROSETTA
             One waffle, three beers, and three
             non-alcoholic beers.
                  (a moment)
             Did you take that girl's place?

RIQUET, a thin man with scruffy hair and soft demeanor,
wears an apron, and then sets the drinks down on the
counter.

He works on the rest of her order as his BOSS enters the
wagon.

                           BOSS (O.S.)
             Hello.
                  (a moment)
             No problems?
                                                        12.
Rosetta takes notice.

The boss takes money from the register and counts it.

She focuses on the money like its a foreign gem.

                        BOSS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm leaving two-thousand in the
          till.

                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Okay.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta hurries around the opposite side of the wagon to
the Boss while he sorts things in the trunk of his car.

                        ROSETTA
          Sir, are you looking for anyone to
          sell waffles?

He stops and looks at her.

                        BOSS
          No.

He shuts the trunk.

                        ROSETTA
          Or anything else?

                        BOSS (O.S.)
          Not at the moment. Sorry.

He walks off and she takes a bite from her waffle.

MOMENTS LATER

She goes back to the front counter of the wagon, loads
her drinks into her bag, and then hands Riquet money.

                        RIQUET
          What did you talk to the boss
          about?

She ignores him.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You looking for work?

She picks up her waffle, takes her change, and then
leaves back around and down the way she came.
                                                        13.
INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta walks to her bed on the right side of the trailer
while grasping her stomach in obvious discomfort.

                        ROSETTA
          Get me some water.

She sits and clutches her knee up to her chest, trying to
ease the pains.

                        MOTHER (O.S.)
          When I used to get that--

                          ROSETTA
          I don't care.

She starts to rock herself.

                        MOTHER (O.S.)
          I can tell you at least.

                        ROSETTA
          You tell me every time. I'm not
          you.

The pain isn't going away. She pops the cap off a pill
bottle and takes out a pill. Her Mother arrives with a
jug of water.

                        MOTHER
          Hold the glass for me.

Straining, Rosetta picks up the glass and holds it. Her
Mother clumsily pours her water, and then Rosetta takes
the pill between breaths of anguish. It isn't letting up.

Spotting her Mother, she jumps up and grabs a bag her
Mother has gotten a hold of. They both pull for it.

                        ROSETTA
          It's not six yet.

                        MOTHER
          But you're home.

Her mother yanks hard on the bag and Rosetta is losing
grip.

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          `Cause I got fired, not so you
          could go drinking.
               (a moment)
          Give it back!

She pulls harder.
                                                        14.
                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Give it back!

Her Mother shoots daggers at her: cold eyes devoid of
feeling or concern.

                           ROSETTA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Give it to me.

After a moment, her Mother lets loose, almost pushing the
bag into Rosetta. Rosetta goes back to her bed and throws
the curtain across it.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          All you think about is drinking
          and fucking.

On her bed, she moves uncomfortably, trying to deal with
her stomach. She clenches her teeth while taking in
breaths and fighting this agony.

After a moment, she lays back and rests her head, and the
pain starts to subside. The sound of a whistling wind can
be heard and she looks over at her narrow window.

Feeling around its edge, she moves its thin curtain and
slides her fingers along the bottom seam. She finds a
small indentation blowing in air.

She pulls a toilet paper roll from her small bag and
wraps a few pieces into a bundle, and then squashes the
paper into the seam.

She presses with her hands, and then finds some scissors
to tighten it down.

                        MOTHER (O.S.)
          Let me have one.

                        ROSETTA
          Get out of here.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta lifts her mattress and pulls out a hair dryer.
She plugs it in and lays back on her bed. The pains have
returned.

She fights them, and uses the dryer to massage her
stomach.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta, in her usual garb, is eyeing something from
behind a trailer, trying not to be seen. After a moment,
she spots someone and hurries down into a spot under
another trailer, watching.
                                                     15.
A man passes by in the distance, and then she pops out
and starts to follow, stopping at a shed nearby to watch.

She creeps slowly across a gravel path up to another
trailer's door. She listens a moment, and then whips the
door open.


INT. NEIGHBORING TRAILER HOME - DAY

Inside, she turns in to its kitchen to find her Mother
with an unkempt MAN. They stare at her.

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          Why do you bring her alcohol?

                        MAN
          Just one drink.

                        ROSETTA
          You know she's trying to stop.

A moment. Rosetta quickly grabs the bottle and runs out
of the trailer.

                          MAN (O.S.)
          Give it back!

                        MOTHER (O.S.)
          Leave her alone.

Rosetta scurries off as the Man exits the trailer.

                          MAN
          Give it back!

She smashes the bottle against the shed.

Rosetta runs down the gravel path, picks up some rocks
and turns.

                        MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You owe me one-hundred and twenty
          francs!

                        ROSETTA
          Go to a whorehouse if you want to
          fuck!

She throws the rocks at the Man who hurries toward her.
She runs off between two trailers, and he follows.

                        MOTHER (O.S.)
          Just leave her alone!

The Man cuts her off and she runs back.
                                                     16.
                          MOTHER (CONT'D)
            Leave her alone!

Her mother gets in his way and tries to stop him. Rosetta
stops behind a trailer and peaks around at them a moment.

MOMENTS LATER

She hurries towards a larger grass area just as Riquet
shows up on a whiny moped. She charges toward him.

                          ROSETTA
            Who told you I lived here?

Before he can open his mouth she tackles him to the
ground and beats him. They struggle for a while in the
muddy grass.

She's like a wild animal whose cave has been discovered
and wants to kill her intruder.

He finally pins her arms, but she still thrashes.

                          RIQUET
            There's an opening. The boss fired
            someone.

She struggles a bit before the words sink in. They stare
at each other a long moment.


INT. WAFFLE FACTORY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

BACK ROOM

Rosetta puts her jacket in a locker and takes out an
apron. She fusses with its tag, and then rips it off with
her teeth. She puts the apron on with a tight bow.

WAFFLE PROCESSING ROOM

The Boss, in an everyday T-shirt, stands next to Rosetta
as they loom over a large flour vat machine, pouring in
the milk. He finishes, and she follows suit.

She puts the empty bottles into a crate.

                          BOSS (O.S.)
            Okay, now we add two quarts of
            water.
                 (pointing)
            Get the measuring cup down there
            and set it here.

He taps the top of a metal cart, and then grabs a hose
and hands it to her.
                                                       17.
                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Hold tight here, and careful with
          the pressure.

She nods and starts to squeeze the nozzle, letting water
into the measuring jugs. He watches.

                         BOSS (CONT'D)
                (after a moment)
          A little more.
                (a moment)
          Good.

She stops and puts the hose back in its place, and then
picks up the jug and goes to the vat.

                        BOSS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Pour it in.

She does, and then walks back to the cart to set it down.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          No, always back where you got it.

She puts the jug into the cart's holder, and he rolls it
off to the side.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
               (moving to opposite
                wall)
          Now four sacks of flour. I'll show
          you how to carry them.

She follows him to a mound of stacked flour bags. He
pulls one half way out.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Slide it onto your knee and grab
          it like this.

He leans over, hugging the sack, and then lifts and looks
at her. She nods. He sets it down and she moves to it.
Rosetta slips it down to her knee, hugs, and then lifts.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Lay it over the edge of the bowl.

They both go back to the vat, and she slumps the bag over
its edge.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Pull on the string...
               (rips off the seal)
          ... and move around the bowl as
          you pour it in.

He gestures the motions and she follows suit.
                                                     18.
                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Now back this way.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta puts the empty bag with the others and the Boss
moves to a large crate of eggs besides her.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Now I'll add two-hundred eggs.

There's a knock at the door.

                           BOSS (CONT'D)
                 (loud)
          Yes?
               (to Rosetta)
          Six trays of forty each. You go
          get the other sacks of flour.

She walks over to the flour as a WOMAN enters and stands
near the door.

                        WOMAN
          You forgot to stamp my form.

                           BOSS (O.S.)
          I did?

Rosetta grabs the flour as the Woman hands him the form.

                        WOMAN
          They said I was entitled to miss
          work. You can't fire me.

Rosetta moves to the vat.

                           BOSS (O.S.)
          They're wrong.

                        WOMAN (O.S.)
          You know my baby's sick.

                        BOSS (O.S.)
          Not ten times a month!

Rosetta empties the flour bag as per trained while the
Boss goes into a back room. She glances over to the
Woman, and then back.

Rosetta goes back to the flour table and pulls on another
bag, right next to the Woman who she's replaced. The
Woman watches as Rosetta ignores her.


EXT. STREETS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                                                        19.
INTERSECTION

Rosetta hurries across the road passing cars, and then
hops a barrier.

BRIDGE AREA BUS STOP

She passes a bus, and hurries down the street.


EXT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

Rosetta stands at the entrance to the wagon door. After a
moment, Riquet comes out and moves between the wall and
the wagon. He fusses with a tire.

                        RIQUET
          It's caught under the wheel.

She watches him shove inward a few times.

                          RIQUET (CONT'D)
          There.

She turns a nozzle off the end of the wagon, and water
comes out. She fills her water bottle. He stops next to
here.

                          LADY (O.S.)
          Anyone here?

                        RIQUET
          I'm coming.
               (to Rosetta)
          Wanna go for a drink? I'm off at
          four thirty.

                         ROSETTA
                (not looking)
          No.

Riquet heads inside the wagon.

                        RIQUET
          Then see you tomorrow.

                        ROSETTA
          See you tomorrow.

She bends down and picks up her waffle, holds it in her
mouth, and then stuffs her bottle into her small bag. She
starts to leave, but then peaks through the door's crack.

She watches him work for a moment, and then runs off.


EXT. RUSTIC OUTSKIRTS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                                                        20.
STREET

Rosetta hurries across the street, avoiding cars. She
heads into the woods.

THE WOODS

She pulls her boots from the pipe, swaps her shoes, re-
covers the hole, and then gathers her things and leaves.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

It's peaceful. Rosetta scans through a small notebook as
her Mother sits on the chair, mending quietly.

                           MOTHER
            Look.

Rosetta walks over and looks at her work.

                           ROSETTA
            That's good.

She goes back to checking the notebook.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta, standing behind her bed curtain, takes a small
pouch from her bag, and then money out of the pouch. She
holds it in her mouth while she re-secures the pouch back
inside her small bag.

MOMENTS LATER

She holds out the money in front of her Mother, waiting
for her to take notice.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
                 (after a moment)
            You wanna take it to him?

Her Mother hesitates a moment, and then bites off the
string to her needlework. She sets it down, snags the
money, and then heads out the door.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
            Tell him he can't turn it off
            without telling us first.

She writes in the notebook, underlines with vigor, and
then puts it in a tin box and up onto a shelf.

She turns and picks her apron up off her bed and lets out
a slight grin, the first she's had in a long time.
                                                       21.
EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Between the shed and fence, Rosetta snaps a stick in
half. She moves to the front of the shed, and in her
bucket soaks the apron. She stirs, washing it thoroughly.

She briefly touches the hot water, and then turns on the
nozzle, but nothing comes out. She gets up and walks off.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta stomps between trailers, around one, and then the
other. She walks across the wet grass and makes her way
to the Manager's office.

She walks around it and opens a storage gate and stops.

Inside, her Mother sits on her knees and the Manager
quickly snaps up his pants and ties his belt.

                          ROSETTA (O.S.)
          Get out.

Her Mother lowers her head like a scolded child, and then
exits without looking at Rosetta.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          The five-hundred francs.

Her Mother hands her the money. Rosetta glares at her as
she goes, and then turns to the Manager.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          A receipt.

The Manager writes out a receipt on a cheap copy-wax
notepad, and then tears it out and hands it over.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Turn the water on first.

                        MANAGER (O.S.)
          Pay and I'll turn it on.

                        ROSETTA
          I'm here to pay the rent, not to
          get the water back on.

                        MANAGER
          I don't see the difference.

                          ROSETTA (O.S.)
          I do.

He slowly turns around and walks to the back, and then
turns on a nozzle. Indifferent, he walks back and holds
out the receipt. She snags it and hands him the money.
                                                        22.
INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta folds clothes and puts them in a bag. She grabs a
brush from a container on a shelf, and then walks to her
Mother.

                        ROSETTA
          Brush your hair.

She lies with her back toward her, ignoring. Rosetta rips
off her sheet and her Mother spins around.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Get up.

Her Mother apprehensively sits up, and then takes the
brush.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          And put your shoes on.

Rosetta moves to the shelf and grabs the tin box. She
opens it and searching through papers.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
               (to Mother)
          Where's your I.D. card? In the
          box?

No answer. Rosetta puts down the box, and then goes to
her Mother's bed. She tries to lift the mattress, but her
Mother pays no mind. Rosetta gives her a look.

Her Mother gets up and watches Rosetta push up the
mattress a moment. She bolts out the door, shutting it
behind her.

Rosetta hurries after, but her Mother pushes the door
shut from the other side. She quickly moves to the
kitchen window and pulls out its hydraulic pins.

Struggling a moment, she gets it open, hops up on the
sink, and then slides herself out.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta runs down a gravel road and comes to a stop near
a shack. No sign of her Mother. She turns and quickly
hops a small fence.

MOMENT LATER

She rushes around an old shed near an abandoned garden
area, and spots her Mother running off to her left. She
gives chase.
                                                     23.
Her Mother runs as fast as she can, but Rosetta gains on
her. She snags part of her Mother's sweater, and then
pulls her to the ground. She lets out a scared yelp.

Rosetta struggle to keep her down.

                        MOTHER
          I don't want to go! Let me go!

She shoves Rosetta off her, and then begins to cry.
Rosetta sits there catching her breath, watching her sob
for a long while. She finally gets up and moves to her.

                        ROSETTA
          Come on.
               (a moment)
          It's the only way you'll make it.
          They'll take care of you.

                        MOTHER
          I don't care if I make it!

Rosetta doesn't know how to respond. She gets up and
walks over to her Mother's shoe, and then picks it up and
brings it back.

She tries to put it on her, but her Mother yanks it from
her, and then puts it on herself.

                        ROSETTA
               (helping her up)
          Come on.

MOMENTS LATER

They both slowly walk down the gravel path near the pond.
Her Mother is dirty and distraught as Rosetta trails her,
showing slight concern.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          I'll try to get you a sewing
          machine when you come back.

Her Mother ignores her.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          What's a used on cost?

Still no response. They walk a while as Rosetta
periodically looks at her for an answer.

Her Mother bolts away in the opposite direction. Rosetta
quickly snags her sweater and drags behind her. They
wrestle for a moment, but her Mother has weight on her
and swings her off.

Rosetta goes sailing into the pond.
                                                        24.
Her Mother runs off as Rosetta bobs her head up, coughing
and swimming poorly.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
            Mom!

She goes under, and then manages to resurface.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
            Mom!
                 (a moment, screaming)
            It's all muddy!
                 (a moment)
            Mom!

She tries to keep herself afloat as neither her Mother
nor her cries come to her aide.

                            ROSETTA (CONT'D)
                   (after a moment)
            Mom!

She bobs.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
            It's all muddy!

Her eyes are closed and she's losing strength as she
fights the water. She slowly paddles her way toward some
long weeds, managing to keep her head afloat.

Grasping the weeds, she holds herself steady and coughs.
After a moment, she claws her way up and out onto the
gravel, bootless.


EXT. STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

BRIDGE AREA BUS STOP

Rosetta runs around the corner just in time to see Riquet
riding his moped off in the distance. She turns back and
runs up a small hill.

MAIN ROAD

She rounds the railing of the sidewalk into on coming
traffic as she watches his moped buzz off the opposite
direction.

She stops and lets out a finger-whistle, but its no use.
She stands there a moment.

ANOTHER STREET

She fast walks down the sidewalk, passing the glaring
windows of stores and boutiques.
                                                      25.
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

Riquet opens the door to a waiting Rosetta.

                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Come in.

She hesitates, and then walks inside.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          How'd you know I lived here?

                        ROSETTA
          I asked the boss.


INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX SPARE UNIT - NIGHT

It's dark, and the room is filled with junk. Riquet
points to an open section on the floor.

                        RIQUET
          You can put your cooking stuff
          there, and there's water there.

He walks over and moves a box, and then points to a plug.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          You can plug a heater in there.
               (to her)
          I don't think she's asking much.

                        ROSETTA
          How much?

                        RIQUET
          Less than what I pay. Less than
          five-thousand francs.

He points to a dislodged door.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          There's a shower over there.

Riquet moves the door and a load of debris from the
opening.

                         RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Needs a little work. I could fix
          it up for you.

                        ROSETTA
               (not to him)
          Can I have those boots?

                        RIQUET
          What boots?
                                                     26.
                        ROSETTA
          Down there.

He looks down, and then slides out a pair of identical
plastic boots to her old ones. He hands them to her.


INT. RIQUET'S UNIT - NIGHT

A small, two room place. Rosetta watches Riquet tidy up
the combined kitchen and eating area.

                        ROSETTA
          You make waffles?

                         RIQUET
          No, it's just a waffle iron I'm
          trying to fix.
               (walking toward
                crate)
          Want a beer?

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          Just water.

He looks at her a moment, and walks to the sink. She
watches him take a glass out and pour her some water.
After a moment, he comes over and hands her the glass.

                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Give me the boots.

He sets them down, out of the way of the table, and then
walks over to the crate and grabs himself a beer. He pops
its cap and briefly looks at her. Uncomfortable.

He takes a drink and looks at Rosetta. Her eyes are on
the table as she drinks her water and he drinks his beer.
They both wait for the other to say something. Finally:

                        ROSETTA
          Did you win that?

                        RIQUET
               (realizing)
          Oh, yeah.
               (a moment)
          I was a champion in floor
          gymnastics... well, provincial
          champion.

He smiles, but she has no response, so she drinks. Her
unresponsive coldness is making itself apparent.

MOMENTS LATER

Riquet tries to do a handstand, but fails back.
                                                        27.
                          RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Wait...

He steadies himself, and then tries again. He slowly
crawls forward and lifts his legs slowly, eventually
stretching them upward into a full handstand.

Upon coming down, he flops onto his back and kicks his
shelf. He looks at Rosetta, embarrassed, and her smile
turns into a short laugh.

MOMENTS LATER

Riquet and Rosetta sits at the table, both eating French
toast in silence. Riquet periodically glances at her,
waiting for her to speak. But she stares at her plate.

                        ROSETTA
          You been doing the trick long?

                          RIQUET
          What trick?

                        ROSETTA
          Your scam with the waffles.

                        RIQUET
          From the start.

He smiles at her, but she ignores it and continues to
slowly eat the her waffle.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          What did you come behind the stand
          to tell me?

                          ROSETTA
          Nothing.

                          RIQUET
          Nothing?

                        ROSETTA
               (after a moment)
          I wanted to watch you work.

Riquet isn't sure what to say.

                         RIQUET
               (after a moment)
          More to drink?

                          ROSETTA
          Yeah.

He takes their glasses.
                                                        28.
                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          A beer.

He brings over two beers and sets them on the table.

                        RIQUET
          More French toast?

                        ROSETTA
          Yeah.

He grabs the frying pan, and slides the last piece of
toast onto her plate.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Thanks.

Riquet opens both their warm bottled beers and as she
puts sugar on her toast. He taps her bottle with his.

                        RIQUET
          Cheers.

Rosetta downs her beer and sets the bottle down heavily
on the table. Riquet is taken aback and at a loss for
words. He watches her carve into her toast a moment.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          What music do you like?

                        ROSETTA
          What?

                        RIQUET
          What music do you like?

                        ROSETTA
          I don't know. Anything.

                        RIQUET
          Wanna hear some drums?

                        ROSETTA
          Yeah.

Riquet pops up and heads over to a cassette player on a
small table.

                        RIQUET
          It's me playing some stuff. I tape
          it to get better.

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          You play in a group?
                                                        29.
                        RIQUET
          I'm starting to.
               (a moment)
          I practice on a friend's set.

The lofi sounds of drums kick on in an almost unbearable
rhythm. Broken beats of an obvious beginner. He sits back
down.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          You play anything?

                        ROSETTA
          No.

They sit in silence, listening to Riquet's tape. He tries
to hide his anxiousness while looking for some type of
response from her. There is none.

The tape drones on, and Riquet looks down in
embarrassment. The drums hammer out as she continues to
carve at her toast, with her unchangeable expression.

                        RIQUET
               (picking up his beer)
          It's pretty bad.
               (a moment)
          I'll turn it off if you want.

                        ROSETTA
          No, no.

He takes a drink, and the drums bash into a defective
crescendo and it goes quiet. The scratching of her
cutlery are interrupted by the clacks of drum sticks.

                        RIQUET
          This part I do okay.

Drums start again. He looks at her for a reaction, but
she just sits there, not looking at him. He pops up and
goes over to the tape deck.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          This is the same stuff with my
          group.

The music changes, including a singer, and Rosetta looks
over. Riquet takes notice.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Not bad, huh?
               (approaching her)
          Wanna dance?

                        ROSETTA
               (not to him)
          I don't know how.
                                                        30.
                        RIQUET
          Doesn't matter.

                        ROSETTA
          No.

Riquet sits back down and starts to bob his head to the
music. She continues away, despondently, at her toast.
Riquet pops up.

                        RIQUET
          Come on!

                        ROSETTA
          No...

                        RIQUET
          It's easy.

She shakes her head.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Come on.

He grabs her arm and tries to lift her. She hesitates,
and then gives in and stands up. He leads her near the
narrow space between the table and oven, and then wraps
his arm around her waste.

She's lost and doesn't know what to do with herself. She
keeps her eyes down.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Hold my hand tight.

He helps her hold his right hand.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Keep your arm firm.

The music breaks for a moment and Riquet waits on his
drumming break down, knowing its awful.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Hold on.

She drops her hand.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          That's where I mess up.

The music kicks back up again and Riquet retakes her hand
and position. He puts her arm around his right shoulder,
and then starts to bounce and swing.

Rosetta goes along, but he does most of the work.
                                                        31.
                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Watch my feet. That's the basic
          step.

She watches his feet a moment, and then he forces her
into a clumsy over arm twirl and back. She slightly
smiles.

They pick up their speed and she starts to move stilted.
He twirls her again into a wrap around, and they change
sides.

It's a mess, but it's starting to come around.

Abruptly, she lets go of him and hunches over, grasping
her stomach.

                           RIQUET (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

She makes her way to her seat and takes her jacket, and
then hurries out his door.

                           RIQUET (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

He follows her into the dark hallway as she rushes down
the stairs.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Rosetta, what's wrong?
               (a moment)
          What's wrong?


EXT. RIQUET'S UNIT - NIGHT

It's quiet. Rosetta walks to Riquet's door, hesitates,
and then knocks. After a moment, he opens the door.

                        ROSETTA
          I forgot the boots.

He's perplexed a moment.

                        RIQUET
          Do you want a ride home?

                           ROSETTA
          No.

He walks disappears back into the room, and she waits.
After a moment, he returns, and then hands her the boots.
She looks at them.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          I don't want to go back to the
          trailer tonight.
                                                        32.
INT. RIQUET'S UNIT - NIGHT

Rosetta stands near the table in silence as Riquet walks
over with some blankets and a pillow. He hands them to
her, and then straightens a fold out cot in the corner.

He puts down padding, and she hands him the blankets. He
makes it as nice as possible, and then stands.

                        RIQUET
          Good night.

                        ROSETTA
          Good night.

He leaves, and she sets her things in the corner and sits
on the bed. She takes off her shoes.

MOMENTS LATER

She lies in bed, staring at the wall.

                         ROSETTA (CONT'D)
               (whispering)
          Your name is Rosetta.
               (a moment)
          My name is Rosetta.
               (a moment)
          You found a job.
               (a moment)
          I found a job.
               (a moment)
          You made a friend.
               (a moment)
          I made a friend.
               (a moment)
          You have a normal life.
               (a moment)
          I have a normal life.
               (a moment)
          You won't be left by the wayside.
               (a moment)
          I won't be left by the wayside.
               (a moment)
          Good night.
               (a moment)
          Good night.

She looks for a bit longer, and then closes her eyes.


EXT. STREETS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Riquet zips his moped up the street with Rosetta on the
back. They turn at an intersection.
                                                     33.
ANOTHER STREET

They head around a corner.


INT. WAFFLE FACTORY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

BACK ROOM

Rosetta stands profile to the lockers, angry and glaring
straight ahead to avoid the Boss's look.

                          ROSETTA (O.S.)
            You're replacing me?

                          BOSS
            It's just temporary.

                          ROSETTA
            Where am I gonna go?

                          BOSS (O.S.)
            If a job opens up, it's yours, but
            I have nothing right now.

She stands there with her rage, and then pulls her bag
from her locker. She walks past him, and then changes
directions down the hall.

                          BOSS (CONT'D)
            Hey, where are you going!

HALLWAY / WAFFLE PROCESSING ROOM

She runs down the hall and bursts into the waffle room.
Running to a corner, she heads down a set of stairs with
an open door. The Boss hurries to follow her down.

STORAGE BASEMENT

She frantically grasps onto a YOUNG MAN near some file
cabinets as the Boss grabs her. INTERCUT SCENES

                          ROSETTA
            Why are you taking my job?

The Boss pulls her off.

                           BOSS
            Calm down!
                 (letting go)
            Calm down now!

                          ROSETTA
            He can go to some other school!
            It's my job!
                                                     34.
                        BOSS
          I'm the boss here. Settle down!

She catches her breath.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Okay? Just calm down!
               (to the Young Man)
          Get up, you big lump.

Rosetta takes off back up the stairs. She grabs a bag of
flour and then hauls it over to the vat just as the Boss
closes its lid.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          How can I make it any clearer?

She drops the bag.

                         ROSETTA
          It's only been three days. You
          can't do this!

                        BOSS
          I wish my son wasn't a fuck up,
          but--

                        ROSETTA
          He messes up and he gets a job,
          but I'm out on the street!

She flips open the vat, and then picks up the flour bag.

                        BOSS
          Give me the sack.

She moves away from him.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          I'll give you severance pay.

He cuts her off and she turns back.

                        ROSETTA
          No, I'm staying!

                        BOSS
          It'll just be a few weeks--

He cuts her off again and she back tracks around the vat.

                        ROSETTA
          I want a job and a normal life
          like everyone else!

                        BOSS
          That's enough now, give me that!
                                                     35.
He tries to grab the flour bag from her, but she dodges
his attempts.

                         BOSS (CONT'D)
          Give it to me.
               (forcefully)
          Give it to me!

He lunges at it, but she falls over onto it, and then
hugs it on the floor. She pants as he paces, not knowing
what to do.


EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

Rosetta waddles through the brush. She stops at the pipe,
pulls her shoes off, and then puts on her rubber boots.
She doesn't re-cover the pipe and walks on.

Stomach pains suddenly hit her like a bullet. She drops
to her knees, clinching her waist and fighting the pain.

After a while, she manages to get herself to her feet,
and then grab her bag. She walks off.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Moving the blow dryer back and forth across her stomach,
Rosetta lies in her bed staring up into her thoughts.


INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Rosetta rounds one aisle for another and heads toward the
back of the store.

MOMENT LATER

A MAN in a suit walks past her.

                           MAN
          No, sorry.

                        ROSETTA
          Maybe later on?

                           MAN
          No.

He walks away from her and she trails him.

                        ROSETTA
          Anyone on a trial basis.

                        MAN
               (uninterested)
          We have a waiting list.
                                                       36.
Rosetta walks off.


EXT. STREET - DAY

At the end of a building, Rosetta peeps around the
corner, watching something.

In the distance, the Boss unloads eggs from the back of
his car.


EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

Rosetta walks down an empty street, passing closed shops.

MOMENTS LATER

She's tucked into a door entrance hugging her stomach and
fighting the torment. The cold escapes from her mouth as
she breathes out the pain.

After a while, she gets up and continues on down the
sidewalk to the end of the street.


INT. OFFICE DUPLEX - DAY

An STOIC MAN in glasses and a sweater vest stands in the
doorway facing Rosetta.

                        STOIC MAN
          If you need help, you can tell me.

                        ROSETTA
          I'm looking for work.

                        STOIC MAN
          We only hire the long-term
          unemployed.

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          What about cleaning your offices?

                        STOIC MAN
          Volunteers do that. I'm sorry.

                        ROSETTA
               (leaving)
          Good-bye.

                           STOIC MAN (O.S.)
          Good-bye.

She heads down the stairs and out the door.
                                                       37.
EXT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

At the back door, Rosetta watches Riquet through the
crack while he works. She takes a bite of a waffle.

                          CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Thank you.

He hands her change.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Thank you. Good-bye.

                          RIQUET
          Good-bye.

Riquet puts money in the register.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
               (to Rosetta)
          Maybe his son will hate it. Or
          maybe he'll hire you for the
          counter. He has twelve stands.

                        ANOTHER CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          A waffle, please.

Riquet wraps a waffle.

                          RIQUET
          Forty francs.

He takes the money in exchange for the waffle, and then
puts the money in the register.

                        ROSETTA
          Here's forty francs.

                        RIQUET
          Don't worry about it.

She steps in the wagon and puts her money on the table.

                        ROSETTA
               (exiting)
          See you tomorrow.

                          RIQUET
          Hold on.

                        ROSETTA
          I'm catching the bus.

She moves faster.
                                                        38.
                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Wait!
               (a moment)
          Wanna come to my place tonight?

                        ROSETTA
          No.

                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Want me to come by the campground?

She rounds the corner and doesn't respond.


INT. BUS - DAY

Rosetta quickly gets on the bus, and then runs to the
back of the bus and exits.


EXT. ROAD - DAY

She runs over to the Boss's car and knocks on his window.
He rolls it down.

                        ROSETTA
          You still mean what you said?

                        BOSS
          What?

                        ROSETTA
          If a job opens up, it's mine?

                        BOSS
          Yeah, but the light's changed.

He starts to drive and she runs along side the car.

                        ROSETTA
          But will I have a job?

                        BOSS
               (driving off)
          I don't know, I can't say in
          advance!

She stops at the center divider and watches him go for a
long moment.


EXT. THE WOODS / TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta unlatches the jerry-rigged fence, and goes under
it to the other side. She re-latches the stick, and then
grabs her bag. Upon turning around, she stops and stares.

The Manager is sitting on a moped.
                                                     39.
                        MANAGER
          The entrance is on the other side.

Her face takes no change as she walks past him down the
gravel path near the pond. After a moment, he turns the
moped around and passes her.

She slowly comes to a stop and watches him go, and then
turns around and walks back down the pathway.

MOMENTS LATER

Hunched over one of her bottles, she wraps a worm over
its hook, looks around for any on-lookers, and then
tightens the wire and tosses the bottle into the pond.

She picks up her other fishing string and pulls it in.
The bottle makes its way to her feet with a decent size
fish inside. The sound of a distant moped grabs her ears.

She looks around a moment, and then tosses the fish back
into the pond, quickly packs up her things, and then
hurries down the gravel path while looking around.

Seeing who it is in the distance, she turns back towards
her fishing lines. As the moped gets closer, Rosetta
tries to snap a branch off a tree through the fence.

Riquet pulls up next to her and stops.

                        RIQUET
          If you need money, I can lend you
          some.

She struggles with a branch.

                        ROSETTA
          No need.

                        RIQUET
          You sure? What about the
          apartment?

She finally rips out a decent sized stick and stomps past
him.

                        ROSETTA
          I don't care about the apartment.

                        RIQUET
          What are you doing?

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          I thought you were the Manager. I
          threw my lines in.

                        RIQUET
          Your what?
                                                        40.
Rosetta leans against a bent tree over hanging the pond,
trying to snatch her lines with the stick.

                        ROSETTA
          My lines, with my trout traps.
               (stretching out)
          I caught one.

Riquet hops off his moped, goes to her, and takes the
stick.

                         RIQUET
          Gimme that.

She watches him adjust himself at the edge, and the back
up.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Gimmie your hand.

She takes his hand and holds it. Riquet leans forward at
the pond's edge with the stick, and then reaches for the
line.

Rosetta slips in the mud and lets go, sending him into
the pond with a yelp. He struggles to stay afloat as
Rosetta doesn't move. She's locked in uncertainty.

                         RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm sinking!

She continues to watch, but doesn't move. His distress
gets more hectic.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm sinking! Rosetta!
               (a moment)
          Rosetta!

He bobs under, and then up, gasping for air.

                         RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Rosetta!

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta runs for the jerry-rigged latch in the fence, and
then hurries through it.

                         RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm sinking!


EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

Rosetta runs to a stop near a tree. Riquet losing battle
can be heard in the distance. INTERCUT SCENES
                                                        41.
                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          Rosetta! Rosetta!

She stares at the ground, breathing hard. She's stuck in
indecision and not moving. After a long moment, she
hurries off.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta runs to a stack of fallen branches and rips a
large branch out from the pile.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Rosetta!

She runs down the gravel path with the branch and stops
at the pond. Sticking it out over the water, Riquet's
back is facing it. He can't see it.

                        ROSETTA (O.S.)
          Grab hold!

He continues to struggle as she tries to get the branch
closer to him.

                        RIQUET
          Quick! I'm sinking!

He reaches his arm up, and then it sags back under. She
stretches as far as she can and hits his hand with the
branch.

He fumbles his hand around, and then finally clasps it.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Quick...

He holds as she pulls him closer and closer to land. He
turns himself just as he reaches the edge.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Pull!

She pulls, and he slides to a flop on the mud. He lays
hunched with his back to her, and catches his breath for
a long while.

                        ROSETTA
          I slipped.

He uses what strength he has left to get to his feet.
Soak and freezing, he slowly takes off his jacket, and
then tries to ring it out. She grabs one end and helps.

                        RIQUET
               (after a moment)
          Wring it out more.
                                                     42.
He takes the jacket and unravels it.

                        ROSETTA
          If you want, you can come dry off
          at the trailer.

                        RIQUET
          No. I'll change at home.

He makes his way to his moped, and then gets on it. He
starts it up, and then rides off, passing her by without
giving a glance. She watches him go.


EXT. STREET / WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

Rosetta exits the bus, walks to the front of it, and then
peeps around it.

Across the street, Riquet opens the waffle wagon's
awning, and then goes behind its door. Rosetta runs
diagonally across the street and under the overpass to
avoid being seen.

                          RIQUET (O.S.)
          Rosetta.

Riquet comes around the corner and she stops.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Didn't you see me?

                        ROSETTA
          I didn't think it was open.

                        RIQUET
          Want some coffee?

                           ROSETTA
                  (whatever)
          Yeah.

                          RIQUET
          Come on.

She hesitates, and then follows him to the front of the
wagon, keeping a slight distance. He latches up the
awnings and looks at her.

                          RIQUET (CONT'D)
          You coming?

She walks around to the side door of the wagon.

                          RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Come inside.

She doesn't move.
                                                        43.
                          RIQUET (CONT'D)
          Come on.

She steps inside, and he pours her a cup of coffee from
his thermos.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          It's hot. It'll do you good.

He hands it to her, and then shuts the wagon door.


INT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

He takes a small bag of waffles from his bag and sets
them under the counter.

                        RIQUET
          You could make the batter for my
          waffles.
               (taking off coat)
          I sell ten a day. Comes to fifteen-
          thousand francs a month. You'd
          have a job.

He sets up his coat and reaches for his apron.

                        ROSETTA
          Working under the counter isn't a
          real job.

                        RIQUET
          At least it's something.

                          CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          You open?

Riquet ties his apron on.

                        RIQUET
          In five minutes!
               (a moment, to her)
          You can keep it all.

She sips her coffee.

                        RIQUET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You interested?

                        ROSETTA
               (after a moment)
          No, I want a real job.

She takes another sip.


EXT. STREETS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                                                       44.
SMALL ROAD

Rosetta exits a stairwell and cross the road.

MAIN ROAD

She roads the corner and moves down the sidewalk, which
heads into the busier part of town.

MOMENTS LATER

She sits on a curb against a shop, staring into her
thoughts and occasionally drinking from her water bottle
for a while.


INT. WAFFLE FACTORY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

OUTER ENTRANCE

Rosetta knocks on the door.

                           BOY'S VOICE
             Yeah?

She opens the door and looks inside.

                           ROSETTA
             Is the boss in?

The Young Man works a flour sack into the vat.

                           YOUNG MAN
             Yeah. In the back, in his office.

She goes inside.

BACK AREA

Rosetta walks through the back area and into another
door.

HALLWAY

She makes her way to a door at the end of the hall.
Through its window, she watches the Boss moving one bag
of flour to a large stack in the corner, and then
repeating the process.

She hesitates for a long moment, and then moves closer to
the window. The boss sets a stack of boxes near a metal
shelf, and then sorts them into place. She knocks.

                           BOSS
             Yes?

Rosetta opens the door and enters, leaving the door open.
                                                        45.
                        ROSETTA
          I came to see if you had any news.

                        BOSS
          It's too soon. I said I'd write
          you. I have your address.

                        ROSETTA
          That's my old address.

                        BOSS
               (reluctant, standing)
          Okay... give me your new address.

He walks over to a desk and grabs a pencil.

                        ROSETTA
          The Grand Canyon.

                        BOSS
          The campground?

                        ROSETTA
          Two-five-two Route de Marche.

He writes it down.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Riquet's ripping you off.

The Boss turns to her.

                         BOSS
          What?

                        ROSETTA
          He's selling his own waffles.

                         BOSS
          How?

                        ROSETTA
          He has a waffle iron at home.

                        BOSS
          How do you know?

                        ROSETTA
          I saw it. His waffles are under
          the counter.

He looks in her eyes a moment, and then he tosses his
pencil onto the desk with a sigh.

MOMENTS LATER

The Boss locks the door, and they both head toward the
exit.
                                                     46.
                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          If I come, he'll know I told you.

                        BOSS
          He'll know anyway.


EXT. UNDERPASS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The Boss and Rosetta walk down the sidewalk at a fast
pace. They finally round the corner, and go toward the
back of the wagon.


EXT./INT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

The Boss yanks open the door and goes inside.

                         RIQUET
          Hello, Boss.

The Boss pulls down the plastic window curtains, sealing
any view from the outside, and then approaches Riquet.

                        BOSS
          Where are they?

                         RIQUET
          What?

                        BOSS
          But the crap. Where are they?

Rosetta stands outside, watching.

                        BOSS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Where are your waffles?

After a moment, she steps inside.

                         ROSETTA
          Right here.

She takes them out from under the counter, and then hands
them to the Boss. Riquet stares at Rosetta in disbelief
as the Boss holds the bag in front of him.

                        BOSS
          What is this?
               (a moment)
          Why'd you do it?

The Boss drops the waffles on the counter. Riquet looks
at them briefly, and then back to Rosetta. His soft eyes
have gone cold.
                                                       47.
                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Give me your apron.
               (a moment)
          Come on. Give it to me.

Riquet slowly takes his apron off, and then slams it
down, keeping his eyes on Rosetta.

                         BOSS (CONT'D)
          Pick it up.

                        RIQUET
               (to Boss, eyes on
                Rosetta)
          You owe me three days' pay.

                         BOSS
          Go on.

The boss tries to grab his arm, but Riquet swipes it off.

                        RIQUET
          You owe me three days' pay!

The Boss grabs Riquet by his shirt.

                        BOSS
          You gonna pick it up?

Riquet grabs him back.

                        RIQUET
          Pay me my three days!

After a moment, the Boss turns him and pushes him toward
the door.

                        BOSS
          Get out, you fuckin' little thief!

Riquet lands against Rosetta and pushes her into him. The
Boss lunges at him just as Riquet exits the wagon.

                         BOSS (CONT'D)
          Beat it!

The Boss picks up Riquet's jacket and bag and throws it
out the door. Picking up the apron, he straightens its
collar.

                        BOSS (CONT'D)
          Here. Put this on.

Rosetta puts on the apron as the Boss raises the plastic
curtains.
                                                     48.
EXT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

It's late. Rosetta exits the door, and then closes it
behind her and fastens its lock. She picks up her back
and heads toward the end of the street.


EXT. STREETS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

UNDERPASS

Rosetta walks down the sidewalk. The buzzing of a moped
abruptly rips through the air, and she hurries across the
street. Not far behind, Riquet moves along.

He gets closer to her, practically on her heels, but she
refuses to acknowledge his presence. His motor echoes
throughout the underpass as he cuts in front of her.

She changes direction and moves around him, keeping her
eyes forward. He's along side her, waiting for her look,
but she refuses. He bumps her, but it has no affect.

Finally, exiting the tunnel, she bolts up a grasses
embankment that leads to the high street. He takes off
the other way.

HIGH STREET

She rounds a railing, and then turns and jumps a wall.

WALKWAY

She runs down a walkway, and then turns a corner, heading
down into an path under the street.

Exiting out the other side, she hustles to an overpass
walk way, only to see Riquet driving up the other side
and heading toward her.

She duck runs back down the walkway.

STAIRWELL

She bustles down a set of stairs away from the road, and
then hides up against the wall. She breathes hard as the
sound of the moped disappears.

INTERSECTION

She crosses the street and climbs over a guardrail to the
sidewalk, and then turns a corner into a back area of a
vacant lot.

The sound of the moped buzzes and she looks over. Riquet
is only fifty yards away. Rosetta runs up a set of
stairs, and he drops his moped and gives chase.
                                                       49.
UPPER WALKWAY

She exits the top of the stairs and he gets a hold of her
jacket. He tugs her around like a toddler.

                           ROSETTA
          Let me go!

He jerks her back and forth, and then into the small
railing.

                        RIQUET
          Why'd you do it?

She tries to get by, but he grabs her and pushes her
back. She does it again, and he takes her by the jacket
and pulls her into the corner of the railing. Pinned.

                           ROSETTA
          Go on, hit me!

He has her jacket up to her neck, half choking her.

                        RIQUET
          Why'd you do it!

                        ROSETTA
          I wanted a job.

He stops and looks at her, unsure of how to respond.
After a moment, he lets her go and she peels away, and
then heads up another set of stairs.

She reaches the top, and he catches up to her again,
stopping in front of her.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Let me by.

He pushes her back. She tries to go around. He pushes her
again. She gets by and he moves in front of her and
shoves her multiple times.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Let me by!

He pushes her aside and stomps walks on.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
               (back to him)
          I wasn't going to help you out of
          the water!

                           RIQUET (O.S.)
          But you did!
                                                      50.
He runs up to her again, and then gets in front of her.
The anger hasn't left his face. She stops and they stare
at each other a moment.

                          ROSETTA
          Let me by.

He just stands there. She walks around him and continues
down the walkway, catching her breath.


EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta exits the trailer, and then locks the door. She
heads down the steps, walks over to the shed, and then
takes out her bottle from her bag and fills it.

She stands and walks past her trailer, and then another.


INT. WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

Rosetta pulls one of her fishing wires out from her bag,
and then moves her tin of worms aside.

She goes to the door, opens it, looks around for signs of
Riquet, and then ties the wire through the keyhole. She
seals herself inside the wagon.

Quickly taking off her jacket, she hangs it on a hook,
and then moves to her apron and puts it on. She moves
over to the waffle burners and switches them on.

Taking an envelope off the counter, she brings it to the
register and opens it. It's filled with the days' petty
cash.

She unloads it into the register, orderly, and then
cleans off the counter.

MOMENTS LATER

She wraps a waffle for a customer. Her face has taken on
a new lightness of color from working and enjoys this.

                          ROSETTA
          Here you go.

She hands it over, and takes the customer's money.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          That's forty francs. Have a nice
          day.

                          CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Thank you.
                                                        51.
                        ROSETTA
          Thank you. Have a nice day.

She walks over to the register and puts the money in.

Moving over to the iron, she lifts its lid and takes out
a waffle, sets it on the counter, and then reaches down
and grabs the batter.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          A waffle and an Ice Tea.

                        ROSETTA
               (filling iron)
          Coming up.

She finishes, and then wraps a waffle for the customer.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Here you are.

She turns and takes a can of Ice Tea off the back shelf.
Rosetta starts to hand it to the customer, but something
catches her eye. Her face goes cold.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
               (to customer, dismal)
          That's seventy-five francs.

She takes the customer's money, and then goes to the
register and gets his change.

                        FEMALE CUSTOMER (O.C.)
          Two waffles, please.

                        ROSETTA
          Coming right up.

She hands the customer his change, and then goes to the
waffle iron.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Thank you. Good-bye.

                        ROSETTA
               (not looking)
          Good-bye.

She's back in her head as she readies the lady's waffles.
She takes one from the iron, wraps it and hands it to
her, and then does it again, avoiding looking over.

                           ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Eighty francs.

                           FEMALE CUSTOMER (O.C.)
          Thanks.
                                                     52.
                        ROSETTA
          Thank you.

Rosetta takes her money, turns around and puts it in the
register. She moves over to the batter under the counter
with her back to the windows.

                        RIQUET (O.S.)
          A waffle.

She puts a couple batter molds on the irons, ignoring
him. After a moment, she slowly reaches for her tongs,
and then peels off a waffle and wraps it.

She hands it to him without looking and hold out her hand
for money.

                        RIQUET (CONT'D)
          A beer.

She reluctantly grabs a beer off the shelf and puts it on
the counter in front of him. She looks at him, coldly. He
gets his money out and hands it to her.

She walks over and puts it in the register.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          One waffle, please.

                        ROSETTA
          Right away.

She takes Riquet's change and hands it to him, keeping
her eyes away. Riquet watches her a moment, and then
walks off. She brings a waffle over to the customer.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          That's forty francs.

She wraps it, and hands it to him as the customer gives
her the money.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Thank you.

                        ROSETTA
          Thanks. Good-bye.

She heads to the register.

MOMENTS LATER

Rosetta sits against the back counter looking out while
reading her thoughts. After a moment a customer
approaches.

                        CUSTOMER (O.S.)
          Two beers, please.
                                                        53.
                          ROSETTA
                 (smiling)
            Coming right up.

She takes a couple beers off the shelf and puts them on
the front counter.

                            ROSETTA (CONT'D)
            Here you are.

                            CUSTOMER (O.C.)
            Thanks.

                          ROSETTA
            Thank you. Good-bye.

She drops the money in the register, and then goes back
to her spot against the back counter. Content.


EXT. STREET / WAFFLE WAGON - DAY

Rosetta exits the wagon door and looks around. She
carries an iron rod lock.

She pulls down the awnings one by one, and then slides
the iron rod through the front hooks of the wagon.
Sealing them in place, she locks the rod.

She pushes the back door shut and slides another lock
through the latch, and locks it. Picking up her bag, she
heads to the corner of the street and peaks around before
turning down it.

She walks towards the bus stop.


EXT. RUSTIC OUTSKIRTS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

She runs across the street, avoiding traffic, and makes
her way into the woods.

THE WOODS

She walks along, eyes down and quiet. She eventually
comes to the pipe and removes its cover. She pulls out
her boots and replaces them per routine.

Putting the cover over the pipe, she grabs her bag and
continues through the trees toward the fence.


EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta stands idle, staring at something. After a
moment, she moves a little, and then stops again, not
taking her eyes off it.
                                                        54.
Expressionless, she finally moves around the trailer and
bends down. She pulls her passed out Mother by her arm
and sits her up. She lets go, and her Mother falls back.

Rosetta secures her small bag around her neck, and then
bends down and tries to grab her Mother again. She
struggles to move her.

Lifting her arm around the back of her neck she squats
low.

                          ROSETTA
          Help me.

Her Mother is too drunk to be of use. Rosetta lifts her
with all her strength, and eventually gets her to her
feet. She slowly slump walks her toward their trailer.

They reach the front steps and Rosetta leans into her
against the wall.

                          ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          Sit down.

Her Mother falls onto her, crashing them both into the
steps. Rosetta gets herself up and walks to the door,
takes her bag off, and then finds the key.

She unlocks the door, opens it, and then looks at her
Mother.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta drops her Mother onto her bed, and then pulls off
her shoes and drops them. She grabs a blanket off the
floor and lays it across her.

She walks to the door, takes the key out, and then shuts
it and locks it. She turns and looks at her Mother as the
steam escape her mouth while trying to catch Her breath.

She walks over to the stove and grabs a pot and sets it
down. Taking the water jug from the corner, she fills the
pot, sets it on a burner, and then takes a box of matches
from a top shelf.

She lights the gas a flame, and then turns and walks over
to the window that's ajar. She reaches out and pulls up
her plastic bag, and then sets it on the table before
pulling out a half-dozen egg carton from it.

She takes an egg and sets it into the pot of water. As
the water begins to heat, she just stands there, staring
at the water.
                                                        55.
EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta walks past a few trailers, and cross a small
gravel road by the Manager's office to a pay phone. She
digs into her bag, pulls out a card, and then picks up
the receiver.

She puts in the card, waits, and then dials a number.
After a moment, the other end picks up.

                        ROSETTA
          Hello. Is the boss in?

She stands there, waiting. After a while, the Boss picks
up.

                        ROSETTA (CONT'D)
          This is Rosetta.
               (a moment)
          I won't be coming back to work.

She hangs up and pulls out her card.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rosetta takes out her boiled egg and slides it into a
bowl. She sits down at the small table, and then pulls
out her water bottle and pours it over the egg.

She stirs the egg with her fingers in the water a while,
and then pulls it out, rubs it dry on her jacket, and
then cracks it against her forehead and peels.

Dropping the last piece of shell on the table, she takes
a bite out of the egg and sits back briefly, and then
stands.

She walks to the oven, and then turns on all four of the
burners. The gas roars out of the oven top as she takes
another bite from her egg.

She walks over to the door, locks it, and then bends down
and stuffs a towel at its bottom. Pressing firmly into
its seal from side to side, she shuts out the air.

Rosetta stands and walks over to her bed. She sits and
takes off her boots and bites into her egg. She looks at
her Mother a moment, and then whips her curtain closed.

Lying down onto her pillow, casually, the gas still howls
as she takes a bite of her egg, and then another,
finishing it.

She looks at the wall, chewing and waiting and walking
through her mind.

The gas slowly crawls to a sliver and then peters out.
                                                        56.
Rosetta takes notice and sits up, and then pulls back her
curtain. She puts on her boots, and then walks over to
the over and unlatches the propane tank.

She unscrews its head and drops it on the stove.


EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rosetta squints as she struggles to move with the empty
tank. She sets it down next to a trailer, and then pulls
her money holder from her skirt pocket.

She puts a few bills in her mouth, and then puts the
holder back into her pocket.

Lifting the tank with a grunt, she continues on with the
money in her mouth. She walks for a long while, slower,
and then faster, trying not to drop the tank.

Finally, she makes it to the Manager's office and rings
the bell. After a moment, the Manager opens the door and
she holds out her money.

                        ROSETTA
          A canister of gas.

He takes the money, pockets it and walks over to the
storage shed. She follows suit, putting the empty tank
along a wall with a large pile of other tanks.

He comes out of the shed and sets a full tank in front of
her. She slides it over, and then lifts it with both
hands to her knee, and nudges it up to her waist.

Rosetta moves slowly off as the Manager closes the shed.
She re-grips the tank, and makes her way along the
Manager's office.

She stops. In the distance the sound of a light buzzing
can be heard. She looks around, and then continues on.

Trudging with the propane tank, she waddles across the
gravel path back the way she came. She makes it to the
grass and drops the tank, and then catches her breath.

The buzzing sound grows a bit louder as she lifts the
tank and supports it with her knee. She clinches her
teeth and continues to move past a nearby trailer.

Breathing heavily, she wobbles trying to keep her balance
and her breath. The buzzing has grown closer, and its
apparent a moped is in the park.

She focuses on keeping the propane tank in her arms. Her
breaths get deep as she starts to pant while she moves.
Rosetta bumps the tank off her knees and balances.
                                                     57.
Riquet swings around her with a loud buzz from his moped.
She pays no attention and continues to struggle to keep
the propane tank up. He circles her, and peels off.

She crosses the small gravel pathway, and then around the
shed. Again, she stops and lifts the tank up with the
help of her knee. She's using all her strength to go a
snails pace.

Riquet buzzes around her again, trying to get a reaction,
but she keeps moving. He circles again, and she drops the
tank on the gravel and rest her arms.

Riquet peels out in the gravel next to her and she picks
up a hang full of rocks. He tries to buzz off as she
throws them, but he catches most of it.

He stops and she throws another handful again, hitting
him in the back. She walks back to the propane tank and
lifts it as he rides away from her.

She staggers toward the shed as Riquet moves behind it,
and then she falls forward onto the ground and against
the tank. She starts to cough, and then cry.

Riquet circles back and comes to a stop. Rosetta cries as
though it were the first time in her life, against a
propane tank pillow. Her cries turn into wails as she
hides her face.

Riquet walks over and stops next to her. He slowly bends
down and helps her up to her feet. She stands there
against the shed, and then looks at him.

Her crying gradually calms as they look at each other for
a long moment. Her pain gently dwindles from her face,
and it turns soft. It's all right there.

She won't be committing suicide any longer.

                                              CUT TO BLACK

                          THE END
