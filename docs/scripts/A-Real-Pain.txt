INT. JFK AIRPORT - MORNING

As the credits roll, we very slowly zoom in on a young man
sitting alone on a bench at a busy airport.

CUE: Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2

We get glimpses of the young man's face as morning travelers
pass in front of him.

This is BENJI KAPLAN. He has an absent look on his face that
borders on melancholy.

When we finally arrive in close-up, the title appears over
his face: A R EAL PAIN.


EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

In a verdant Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, DAVID hustles
down the street.

He is on his phone, leaving a message for someone.

                    DAVID
          Hey Benji, it's me. I'm just
          leaving my apartment. Remember we
          gotta be there three hours early.
          Just ring me when you get this.


EXT. BQE - DAY

Following David's Uber from behind as it's stuck in traffic.


INT. UBER - DAY

David is in th e back seat, harried and leaving a series of
messages:

                    DAVID
          Hey Benji, I hope you left already.
          I'm stuck in a little traffic on
          the BQE in case you can avoid it.
          Just ring me when you get this.

ANOTHER MESSAGE:

                    DAVID
          Benji, it's me. Good news, traffic
          just cleared up, in case you were
          worried. Anyway, ring me when you
          get this.
                                                              2

AND ANOTHER:

                    DAVID
          Yo, Benji, it's me. I'm sorry I'm
          leaving so many messages. You can
          disregard them cause I'll be there
          soon and I can't wait to see you.
          And I will not leave you another
          message.


INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

David arrives at the airport, leaving another message as he
heads toward a check-in kiosk--

                    DAVID
          Hey Benji, I just got to the
          airport. I really hope you left
          already or are on your way. Just
          ring me when you get this.

He hangs up and approaches a kiosk and begins checking in--

Benji approaches from behind. He's carrying a huge purple
hiking backpack.

                     BENJI
          Dude.

                     DAVID
          Benji!   Yo.

                    BENJI
          What's up cuz!

                    DAVID
              (hugging him)
          Come here. It's so good to see you.

                    BENJI
          Yo, step back! Lemme look at you!

David steps back to be evaluated by Benji.

                    BENJI
          Turn around! Let me get the whole
          picture!

Da vid laughs and does a cute little spin.

                    BENJI
          Shit, man! Look at you -- all
          healthy, wealthy and wise!
                                          3

          DAVID
Thank you, thank you.
    (back to business)
We should probably check you in.      I
did a thing online but-

           BENJI
Oh no, I'm good.     I checked in a
while ago.

             DAVID
Did you?     When did you get here?

          BENJI
Few hours ago.

          DAVID
Really? The flight's not for
another two hours.

          BENJI
Yeah, but they open the airport
super early. You can just hang out.

             DAVID
Oh.

          BENJI
And you meet the craziest people
here. I met this guy Kelvin who
was from Brunei. Fucking Brunei! I
never met anyone from Brunei. Dude
was telling me all about his
business, I think he's actually an
arms dealer but he seemed totally
at peace with the whole thing.

             DAVID
Wait, who?

             BENJI
Kelvin.

          DAVID
Oh, right. And did you eat
anything?

          BENJI
Yeah, a while ago.

          DAVID
Okay, I'm gonna wanna get something
before we take off if that's cool.
                                                           4

                    BENJI
          Don't worry. I picked you up a
          yogurt.
              (takes a yogurt out of his
               pocket)
          It's a little warm.

                    DAVID
          Did you really get this for me?

                    BENJI
          Of course, dude. I figured you'd
          be rushing around and everything.

                    DAVID
          Thank you, Benji.

David prints his ticket and they begin walking to the gate.

                     BENJI
          I also got some shit for us for
          when we get in. Like: very, very
          good shit.

                    DAVID
          You're not taking weed into Poland,
          right? Benji?

                    BENJI
          They don't give a shit about that
          stuff, man.

                    DAVID
          I think they very much do give a
          shit about that stuff.

                    BENJI
          Oh, like they're gonna arrest two
          Jews in Poland for a little weed.
          That's a good look for the Polish
          people.

                    DAVID
          All right, try to keep it down-

                    BENJI
          They can't touch us, dude. We
          basically got government immunity
          there. The prodigal sons return--


INT. JFK AIRPO RT HALLWAY - DAY

From behind, we see the two cousins walking toward security--
                                                                5

As they pass a garbage, David subtly tosses out the yogurt.


INT. JFK AIRPORT SECURITY -- DAY

On the security line, the boys place their bags on the
conveyor belt.

David eyes Benji's bag, nervously. Benji seems completely at
ease -- he makes eyes with the cute TSA AGENT.

                    BENJI
          Hey, what's up.

David clears security and watches from a distance as:

Benji charms the TSA agent. He's animated and funny.

David i s in awe of his cousin's charisma.    Benji grabs his
bag and hustles up to David.

                    BENJI
          Jasmine is so dope.

                      DAVID
          Who?

                    BENJI
          The TSA girl. Her dad does
          security for the Knicks.


INT. JFK AIRPORT GATE - DAY

David and Benji wait at the gate.   David is eating trail mix.
Benji eyes it:

                    DAVID
          Do you want some?   Priya made it
          for me-

                      BENJI
          Oh, sure.

Benji casually takes the bag and digs in.

                    DAVID
          Yo, so, how you been, man?

                    BENJI
          Honestly? I've been...
              (closes his eyes and takes
               a deep breath)
          ...great. Like really great.
                                                           6

                       DAVID
          Oh.

                       BENJI
          Yeah.

                       DAVID
          Really?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, definitely.

                    DAVID
          Do you wanna talk about anything?

                       BENJI
          Like what?

                    DAVID
          Um... like... the last few months?

                    BENJI
          What about 'em?

David wants to bring something up but can't. Benji stares at
him, something unspoken passing between them.

                    DAVID
          Do you wanna go over our tour
          itinerary or anything?

                    BENJI
          Oh, yeah, sure.

David takes out a pamphlet. Benji grabs it and hand s Dave his
trail mix.

                    BENJI
          You mind holdin this for a minute?

                       DAVID
          Sure.

                    BENJI
          Eat as much as you want.

                     DAVID
          Thanks.
              (beat)
          Don't you think it'll be nice for
          us to see where Grandma was from?
          Where she lived?
                                                             7

                    BENJI
          Yeah, maybe. Maybe. It just sucks
          that she's not here with us.

                    DAVID
          Well, she was really suffering. The
          last couple years.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, I know. That sucks too.

Benji looks out the window, squinting into the sun.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

The boys approach their seats.   Benji's still chomping on
David's trail mix.

                    BENJI
          What seat do you have?

                      DAVID
          Uh, 24C.

                    BENJI
          I'm B. Loo ks like we got the
          middle and window.

                      DAVID
          Right.

                    BENJI
          You mind takin the middle?


INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

A few minutes later, David is squished in the middle seat.
Benji is in the window and somehow comfortably spread out.

                    BENJI
          How you feelin in there dude?

                    DAVID
          It's a little tight.

                    BENJI
              (stretching)
          Yeah...
                                                          8

                    DAVID
          So are you still looking for a job?

                    BENJI
          Nah. Are you gonna have to like
          work the whole trip?

                    DAVID
          Nope - I was able to take off
          completely. I wanna be here.    I
          wanna be present.

                    BENJI
          Cool cool. And are you still
          selling shit online?

                    DAVID
          Well, I don't sell old jerseys on
          ebay, I do digital ad sales. God,
          I don't think we've spoken since I
          changed jobs. You know when you
          see, like, an Ad Ba nner online?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, I hate that shit.

                    DAVID
          Hey, come on-

                    BENJI
          No, I mean, everybody hates that
          shit. Right?

                    DAVID
          Um, maybe. Do they?   I don't know.
          But I sell those.

                    BENJI
          No, that's cool, that's cool -
          you're like making the world go
          round. It's not your fault, you're
          just part of a fucked up system.

                    DAVID
          Well without online ads, a lot of
          the sites you're using for free
          wouldn't be able to exist. It's
          kind of the life blood of the
          internet. I'm actually working on
          a campaign I think you would really
          like with this young start up-

In the front of the plane, the Polish flight attendant begins
a safety demonstration--
                                                            9

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT PA
          Ladies and gentleman, if you could
          direct your attention to...

David lowers his voice but keeps talking to Benji--

                     DAVID
          So it's a bunch of really sharp
          kids who--

                    BENJI
          Yo, dude. I think they want us to
          pay attention.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I just wanted to tell you
          about this--

                    BENJI
          Eh, it's kinda rude.

                       DAVID
          Seriously?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, man, they're just tryin to do
          their jobs.

David is embarrassed. He looks on as Benji is completely
engaged with the safety demo.

The flight attendant makes a little joke about seatbelts.
Benji laughs heartily.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Later on the plane, David is awake and exhausted. He looks
over to Benji who is slumped against the window, in a deep
comfortable sleep.

Two small, empty bottles of wine sit on Benji's tray.


LATER

David is on hi s phone watching a video of his son.

                    DAVID (ON VIDEO)
          How many floors is the Empire State
          Building?
                                                          10

                     ABE (ON VIDEO)
          103!

                    DAVID (ON VIDEO)
          Burj Khalifa?

                     ABE (ON VIDEO)
          155!   No, 156. 156.

                    DAVID (ON VIDEO)
          Hudson Yards?

                     ABE(ON VIDEO)
          112.   But the balcony is on 100.

David rewinds the video and rewatches it, missing his son.


LATER

David digs a bottle of prescription pills out of his bag. He
has a few drops left in a water bottle and swallows one pill.


LATER

The plane lands. The lights come on. David hasn't sl ept.
He's bleary eyed. Benji is sleeping with a pained expression
on his face.

                    DAVID
          Yo, Benji, Benji.

Benji stirs awake.


INT. WARSAW AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

The boys walk through the airport, both exhausted from the
flight.

                    DAVID
          You wanna get some breakfast?

Benji just shakes his head.   He has a dark look in his eyes.


INT. WARSAW AIRPORT CUSTOMS AREA - MORNING

The boys walk through the "Nothing to Decla re" side of
customs.
                                                           11

David is silently panicking as he watches Benji's bag go
through a sensor. David makes nervous eye contact with the
serious Polish TSA Agent.

Benji is unfazed as his bag emerges on the other side.


INT. WARSAW AIRPORT - MORNING

After they've cleared customs.    Benji looks bleak.

                    DAVID
          Are you okay?

                    BENJI
              (groggily)
          What? I don't know.
              (suddenly bright)
          Hey, there's our guy--

Benji points to a Polish DRIVER holding a sign that says
"Heritage Tours - KAPLAN." Benji bounds over to him.

                     BENJI
          Yo!   What's up dude?


INT. CAR - MORNING

The boys are in the car, heading into town. Benji is staring
out the window; David is staring at his phone, AirPods in his
ears, watching the video of his son.

Benji elbows David.   David takes out an AirPod.

                    BENJI
          What are you looking at?

                    DAVID
          Oh nothing, just this little video.

                      BE NJI
          Of what?

                    DAVID
              (bashful)
          Oh, it's stupid. I think I'm
          already homesick. It's just Abe.
          He's obsessed with buildings now,
          he wants to know the height of
          every sky scraper. It's kind of,
          like, all-encompassing.

Benji nods and turns back outside.    After a moment:
                                                            12

                    BENJI
          Yo, lemme see it?

                       DAVID
          The video?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, can I see it?

                    DAVID
          Sure, yeah. Of course.

David gives Benji one of his AirPods. They both watch the
video together.

Benji scrolls back and plays it again.    David is surprised.

He notices that Benji has tears in his eyes.

                    BENJI
          He's fuckin gorgeous, man.     You're
          lucky.

                       DAVID
          Thanks.

Benji looks back out the window.


EXT. WARSAW - MORNING

They arrive at an upsca le chain - the Warsaw Central Hotel.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL - MORNING

They approach the front desk.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          Dzien dobry, welcome to the Warsaw
          Central Hotel.

                    DAVID
          Hi, yes. We're checking in -- we're
          with the Heritage Tour. Kaplan,
          Benjamin and David. I have our
          passports here.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          Yes, of course. Welcome. You're
          the final ones to arrive. And I
          think I have a package for you.
          It's been sittin g here for many
          days-
                                                            13

                    BENJI
          Yeah, that's for me, thanks man.

The receptionist hands over a shoddily wrapped little box.
David is baffled as he receives the room keys--

                    RECEPTIONIST
          You're on the fifth floor. And
          there's a group meeting in thirty
          minutes.

                    DAVID
          Thank you so much.

David gathers the passports and keys and begins walking to
the elevator, eyeing Benji's box:

                    DAVID
          What the hell is that?

                    BENJI
          It's the weed. I told yo u, it's
          good stuff. It's from Todd, this
          fuckin barber in Ithica.

                    DAVID
          Wait- you mailed yourself weed?

                    BENJI
          I mailed us weed.

                    DAVID
          Oh! I thought you were taking it
          through the airport!

                    BENJI
          Really?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, really! Did you not see how
          nervous I was?

                    BENJI
          I did. I just thought that was you.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

The boys exit the elevator and begin walking toward their
room.

Benji suddenly swings his arm around David's neck, lovingly
rough.
                                                          14

                    BENJI
          I'm so fuckin happy to be here with
          you.

                     DAVID
          Me too.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The boys enter their room, begin unloading their gear, taking
off their layers--

                    DAVID
          We got a half hour. I'm definitely
          gonna need a shower.

                     BENJI
          Yes sir!   Good idea.

David takes his socks off and sniffs.    Benji notices:

                    BENJI
          Yo, dude. I totally forgot. You
          have super nice feet.

                     DAVID
          Do I?

                    BENJI
          Yeah and they've aged really,
          really well. Your toes are like
          mad straight. It's nice.

                    DAVID
          Thanks, man.

                    BENJI
          No weird feet knuckles or stray
          hairs. Very classy.

                    DAVID
          Okay, thank you. I guess I never
          really evaluated them.

                    BENJI
          You never evaluated your own feet?
          Damn. They're graceful as shit.
          Just like grandma's.

                    DAVID
          You remember grandma's feet?
                                                         15

                    BENJI
          Of course dude. She'd always wear
          those plastic fuckin pink sandals
          from Target. She strutted that hot
          shit all over town!

                    DAVID
          Huh. I never noticed.

Benji sits on the bed next to David.

                    BENJI
          Yo, Davie, sometimes when I look at
          you, I see her.

                    DAVID
          I look like an old Jewish woman?

                     BENJI
          No, man. You just look wise.   It's
          beautiful.

David chokes up, to his surprise. He looks away, embarrassed.

                    DAVI D
          All right, I gotta shower.

                    BENJI
          Cool. You mind if I shower first?

                     DAVID
          Sure. We just gotta be down in a
          half hour.

                    BENJI
          Copy that. Can I borrow your phone?

                        DAVID
          For what?

                    BENJI
          I like to listen to music in the
          shower.

                    DAVID
          Don't you have a phone?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, but it doesn't play music.

                        DAVID
          Uh, okay --

David hands Benji his phone and Benji goes in the bathroom -
                                                           16

David lies on the bed, doesn't know what to do with himself.

He hears Benji start playing music. Benji cycles through
multiple songs to find a good one. David is frustrated.

                      DAVID
          You okay?

Benji finally settles on The Uniques' "My Conversation."

                      BENJI
          Yup!


TWENTY MINS LATER

Another reggae song is playing from the bathroom.

David is lying on the bed, still waiting for the shower.

He stares at his bare feet , evaluating them. We ZOOM in on
David's face, ZOOM in on his feet. Time seems to slow down.

Suddenly, Benji sticks his head out from the bathroom, blow-
drying his hair and shouting over the noise.

                    BENJI
          We should probably head down.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING

The two guys walk down the hallway. Benji is freshly
showered and relaxed. David is sweaty and exhausted.


INT. WARSAW LOBBY - MORNIN G

The guys walk through the hotel lobby.

As they near the restaurant, they see JAMES, a young British
tour guide, finishing a conversation with a hotel employee:

                    JAMES
          Dziki bardzo, Marta.
              (to the boys)
          Let me guess: David and Benjamin.

                      DAVID
          Hi, yeah.    You're James?
                                                            17

                    JAMES
          Yes! Hi! I didn't mean to accost
          you! I just wanted to intercept
          you in case you couldn't find us.

                    DAVID
          Oh, thanks. And I'm sorry we're a
          little late.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, we just wanted to shower
          before we came down.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

James leads the guys towards a corner of the restaurant:

                    JAMES
          We're a relatively small group,
          which will be nice and intimate.

They arrive at a table o f four other tourists, who James
addresses:

                    JAMES
          Success! I found them. Everyone,
          this is Benji and David.

                     DAVID
          Hi.

                    BENJI
          Yo, what's up everybody.

The group kind of nods toward the boys.

                    JAMES
          Sit, sit, sit. So: I was just
          about to ramble on about myself.
          Hopefully you won't be too sick of
          me by the end of the week.

Some titters from the group.

Benji joins in laughing heartily, like he's been there the
whole time. David clocks him.

                    JAMES
          As I was saying, I'm James. I'll be
          your British tour guide through
          Poland. You'll have to excuse the
          posh accent, it's all a ruse.
              (some polite chuckles)
                                                18
                    JAMES (CONT'D)
          I'm a scholar of Eastern European
          studies at Oxford. I am obsessed
          with this part of the world and, in
          particular, the Jewish experience,
          which is fascinating and tragic and
          beautiful. I'm usually the only
          non-Jew on these trips, so please
          feel free to correct me on anything
          that feels inauthentic to you or
          your family's experience. I can
          also speak Polish -- albeit like a
          precocious ten year ol d -- so I'm
          happy to translate anything to make
          your trip as meaningful and
          personal and satisfying as it could
          be. So, blah blah blah and I'll
          stop talking now. Who wants to go
          next? Why are you here? What are
          you interested in? Someone take
          over!

MARCIA, 60s, sharp and wry:

                    MARCIA
          I'll be brave. I'll go. Hi, I'm
          Marcia Kramer. Originally from
          Brooklyn, with two regrettable
          decades in Los An geles. I just
          moved back to New York after a
          divorce - sorry if I'm oversharing,
          you'll notice I tend to do that -
          and found that I was turning into
          the kind of woman I always detested
          - a lady who lunches, basically.

Benji appreciates her humor. David notices.

                    MARCIA
          Uh, my mother was a survivor of the
          camps and literally never spoke
          about it. After she died, I kicked
          myself for never pushing her to
          tell me about her life. So I'm
          here to see where she was from, to
          honor her and to... well, to stop
          kicking myself.

                    JAMES
          Thank you for sharing that, Marcia.
          And you should all feel free to
          over- or under- share as much you
          feel comfortable. Who's next?

DIANE AND MARK BINDER, 60s.
                                                            19

                    DIANE
          Uh hi, Diane and Mark Binder.

                    MARK
          Hello.

                    DIANE
          We're boring. Uh, Recently retired.
          From Shaker Heights. Mark's family
          was from here, down in Lublin, but
          left way before the war, the turn
          of the century.

                    MARK
          We were Mayflower Jews, was always
          my little joke.

Some chuckles.

                     DIANE
          And we were always interested in
          seeing where they lived, what this
          place looked like. My family was
          French -- we were Fr ench Jews. And
          Mark and I have already been to
          Paris, so this was our next trip.

                    MARK
          Yeah, not as glamorous, my side of
          the family. Sorry about that.

Titters from the group.    ELOGE speaks up.   He is a 39-year-
old Rwandan man.

                    ELOGE
          Hi, I'm Eloge. As you might have
          guessed, I was not born Jewish.

A little titter from the group.

                    ELOGE
          I guess you won't be the only one
          on this trip, James.

                    JAMES
          Happy for t he company, Eloge.

                    ELOGE
          But I did convert to Judaism, about
          ten years ago. I am actually
          African born, Rwandan.

This is fucking music to Benji's ears.
                                                      20

                    ELOGE
          And to answer the inevitable
          question that you might be
          thinking, I am a survivor of the
          genocide.

                      BENJI
          Oh shit!

They turn to Benji.

                    BENJI
          No, sorry. I mean it in a good way.
          Like shit, wow. I'm just,
          interested in people from other
          places. I'm sorry. I'm just,
          like, a fan. Keep going, man.

There's an awkward pause.     David is mortified.

                    DAVID
          I'm sorry about that--

                    ELOGE
          No, please, it's actually very
          refreshing. I'm happy when anyone
          is interested in my country. Like
          most places, it's more complicated
          than the world gives it credit for.
          What's your name?

                      BENJI
          Benji.

                    ELOGE
          Benji, I am an open book.

                      BENJI
          Rad.

David can't believe Benji gets away with this shit.

                    ELOGE
          Anyway, I do have a unique story.
          My mother and I survived the war.
          And I moved to Winnipeg with her
          life savings sewn into the i nside
          of my jacket-

                    BENJI
          Jesus, fuck.
                                                          21

                    ELOGE
          And in Winnipeg, I was helped by
          the Faintuchs, a Jewish family--

                       BENJI
          Naturally.

A little laughter from the group.   Benji is charming them.

                     ELOGE
          Yes, naturally, Benji. And when I
          learned about Judaism and the story
          of the Jewish people, I felt at
          peace for the first time since the
          war. And the more I learn about
          the religion and the more people I
          meet -- lovely people such as
          yourselves - the m ore I know I
          made the right decision.

The group is stunned.

                    MARCIA
          I didn't think I would be crying
          before the tour even started.

Everyone laughs as the tension breaks.

                    JAMES
          Wow. Well, this is a first.      Thank
          you so much, Eloge.

There is a nice pause.

                    BENJI
          Who the hell wants to follow that?
              (off their laughter)
          Okay, shit, I'll go. So Davers and
          I are cousins. Actually born three
          weeks apart, which is k inda nuts.
          A Zloty for anyone who guesses
          which one of us older.
              (they laugh)
          Anyway, our dads are brothers.
          We're basically brothers, too,
          right D? We used to be joined at
          the hip
              (Irish accent)
          like feckin Katie and Eilish, isn't
          that right Dave-o?

                    DAVID
          Oh, Jesus man, don't say that.
                                                          22

                    BENJI
          Anyway, our Grandma Dory was from
          here, she survived the war in the
          craziest fuckin way. In basements,
          hidden amongst the uncircumcised-

                    DAVID
          Yeah and everyone else died- her
          parents, her sisters, a brother.

                    BENJI
          It was fucked, essentially, is what
          it was. And we've always wanted to
          come here to see where she was
          from, see the house she grew up in.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, that's why we're leaving the
          tour a day early, Benji insisted we
          see her little town. They were
          super close.

                    BENJI
          She was the coolest - just this
          fierce, no bullshit, fuckin take
          charge chick.

David looks around -- everyone's nodding, seemingly okay with
Benji's vulgarity.

                    BENJI
          And I've been in kind of a funk
          since she died.

                    MARCIA
          I'm so sorry, Benji.

                    BENJI
          Yo, thank you Marcia, you're a
          sweetheart. And things have been
          kinda downhill fo r me. She was my
          favorite person in the world.
              (genuinely chokes up)
          Shit, I'm sorry.

                    JAMES
          No, that's okay, Benji. It's good
          to remember. That's what we're
          here for.

                    BENJI
          Thanks James.
                                                         23

                       JAMES
          Of course.

                    DAVID
          So, just to keep things on track:
          Grandma Dory left some money in her
          will for me and Benji to come here.

                    BENJI
          And Dave could never find the time
          cause he's got a high pressured job
          selling ad banners to the internet.

                    DAVID
          Yo, come on, man.

                    BENJI
          But I've been in such a shit place
          recently, so Dave swooped in, took
          some time off and arranged for us
          to join this geriatric Polish tou r
          with you fine people.

Everyone kind of chuckles and Benji puts his hand on David's
shoulders. David sinks in his chair a bit.

                    BENJI
          You know: She didn't ask any of the
          other cousins to come here. Just
          us.

                    JAMES
          That's really lovely.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, she knew the two of us have a
          special connection, right
          Davercakes?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I'm not really sure what she
          knew. At the end. She was getting
          a little senile .

                    BENJI
          No, she knew.
              (squeezes Dave's shoulder)
          She knew.

CUE: Chopin's bombastic Etude Op. 10 No. 1
                                                            24

EXT. WARSAW - MONTAGE

A flurry of buildings, streets, signs, daily life in this
bustling city set to Chopin's racing Etude.


EXT. WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING MONUMENT - DAY

Greco-Roman heroes stare at us from the iconic Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising Monument. Close shots on the various faces of
martyrdom. Benji and David look up at the faces.

James gathers the group near the foot of the monument:

                     JAMES
          If I can ga ther everyone over here?
          Thank you. I always like to start
          our tour at the Ghetto Uprising
          Memorial. It's a monument to the
          Jewish heroes who fought back. In
          two days, we'll be visiting a
          concentration camp so I think it's
          important to immediately dispel the
          pernicious myth that these were a
          people led like lambs to the
          slaughter.

The group nods sagely.   Benji and David share a look.

                    JAMES
          This is going to be a tour about
          pain, of course. Pain and suffering
          and loss, to be sure, but it must
          also be a tour that celebrates a
          people. A most resilient people.

CUE: Nocturne Op. 9 No. 3


EXT. WARSAW STREET - DAY

The group walks along a street in front of a Soviet-era
apartment block.


EXT. WARSAW STREET - DAY

Through a window, we see Benji buying bottles of water in a
little market kiosk.

He exits the kiosk and distributes the waters to the group.
They are thankful.
                                                             25

As he arrives at David, he explains that he wasn't able to
pay for the waters because he doesn't have any money. David
sighs, hands him some Zlotys and Benji bounds back in to pay.


EXT. KRASINSKI GARDEN - DAY

The gang walks through this peaceful park.

Mark and Diane are asking James questions and Eloge is cross
referencing what he sees with a little Polish guide book.

Marcia walks alone.

Benji and D avid lag behind.   David is sweaty, exhausted;
Benji is amped:

                    BENJI
              (in awe)
          Look at this shit. We'd probably
          live here if the war didn't happen.
          Isn't that fuckin crazy to think
          about?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

                    BENJI
          No, seriously. Like we think of
          ourselves as these very American
          creations, you know? And I guess
          we are. I guess that's, like, the
          essence of America -- people created
          from other cultures. But in some
          parallel, fuckin, black hole
          universe, you and I are Polish and
          we probably got, like, beards and
          shit. And we, like, can't shake
          hands with women.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, it's funny, whenever I see a
          Hasidic guy on the street, I always
          just think, "there but for the
          grace of no god..."

                      BENJI
          What?

                    DAVID
          Oh, it's just like a dumb joke.
                                                           26

                    BENJI
          That's cool, man.
              (looking ahead)
          Yo shit, look at her.

                       DAVID
          What, who?

                    BENJI
          That woman Marcia, she's walkin
          alone. We should go talk to her.

                    DAVID
          We just met her.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, but she's got this, like,
          deep sadness behind her eyes.

                       DAVID
          She does?

                    BENJI
          You didn't notice that?

                    DAVID
          During the introductions? I don't
          know.

                    BENJI
          We should go check on her.

                    DAVID
          Benji, maybe she wants to be alone.

                     BENJI
          No one w ants to be alone, Dave.
          I'm gonna go check it out.

Benji's runs off to check on Marcia.

David is left alone, a little miffed.  He watches as:

Benji catches up to Marcia. They are speaking animatedly to
each other and Marcia seems emotional.

David speeds up to join them but stutters when he hears:

                    MARCIA
          People will eat you alive if you
          give them a fuckin inch.

David watches as Benji nods knowingly an d puts his hand on
Marcia's shoulder.
                                                              27

Then Marcia reaches up and holds Benji's hand.     David is
baffled.

Benji and Marcia walk like this for a bit. She clearly had
some kind of catharsis and Benji is comforting her.


EXT. WALICOW STREET - DAY

The group walks through the ruins of Warsaw, which abut the
height of Central European modernity.

We see the mix of old and new, the bullet holes and the mid-
century rebuild.


EXT. PLAC GRZYBOWSKI - D AY

Benji precariously skips along stones, which jut out of a
pond.

Jump back to reveal that the group is patiently waiting for
him to finish his antics. No one seems to mind.


EXT. PLAC GRZYBOWSKI CAFE - DAY

David exits a cafe with a tray of food. Feeling unsocial, he
takes a seat alone.

After a moment, Benji comes out and spots David:

                     BENJI
          Yo!


TEN MINUTES LATER

Benji and David sit across from each othe r, eating rye soup-

                    DAVID
          What was going on with that woman?

                    BENJI
          What do you mean?

                    DAVID
          The woman with the 'sadness in her
          eyes'. Is she all right?

                    BENJI
          Oh Marcia! Yeah, she's in a really
          weird place right now.
                                                           28

                    DAVID
          She told you that?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, I guess she thinks I can
          relate since we've both lost
          people.

                    DAVID
          You mean our grandma?

                    BENJI
          Yeah. Anyway, she's super fuckin
          stressed right now because her
          husband left her last May, like
          completely out of the blue-

                       DAVID
          Jesus--

                    BENJI
          Yeah, not fun.

                    DAVID
          No. And she just told you all this?

                    BENJI
          Yeah. And now she's seeing this new
          guy, Darren, which you'd think
          she'd be happy about, but he sounds
          like a complete douchebag.

                    DAVID
          Oh really, how?

                    BENJI
              (hesitates)
          Ah, I don't know man. I don't think
          we should be talking about her
          behind her back.

                       DAVID
          Oh, okay.     I was just asking.

                    BENJI
          No, I know. Still.

There's an uncomfortable pause.    They both slurp their soup.

                    DAVID
          Weird soup, right?

                       BENJI
          I love it.
                                                           29

CUE: Chopin's Waltz No. 1 Op. 18


EXT. KREDYTOWA STREET - DAY

From high, we see the group walk through this bohemian drag.


EXT. WITOJERSKA STREET - DAY

The group passes a fragment of the old Ghetto Wall.


EXT. WARSAW UPRISING MONUMENT - DAY

The group approaches the dramatic Warsaw Uprising Monument--
massive bronze soldiers in battle positions.

                    JAMES
          This monument truly speaks to the
          tragic complexity of Polish
          history. The Warsaw Uprising was
          perhaps more tragic in the Russian
          response to the uprising than the
          German crushing of the rebellion.

On Benji and David, listening--

                     JAMES
           These two supposed allies, brothers
           against a common enemy. But
           infighting and spite tore them
           apart.

Back to James--

                     JAMES
          You see, Stalin resented the
          resistance as they'd fought him for
          independence and so he stood back,
          l etting Germany crush the
          resistance in 63 short days. It's
          harrowing. Anyway, I'm sure you
          want to take pictures, it's a
          pretty spectacular sight. But
          please come to me with any
          questions, I'm all too happy to
          talk about the puzzle of Polish
          history.

Mark and Diane approach James with questions.    The rest take
pictures.

Benji approaches Eloge.
                                                              30

                    BENJI
          Yo, Eloge, when you're done, could
          you take a picture of me and Dave
          posing with the guys?

                    ELOGE
          Yes, of course.

                       DAVID
          What?

                    BENJI
          We should go pose with the guys,
          it'll be hysterical.

                    DAVID
          Really? Doesn't that seem, like,
          disrespectful?

                    BENJI
          How the fuck is it disrespectful?
          We're on their side! Fighting the
          Ruskies and the Krauts!

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I don't know if we should-

                    BENJI
          Okay, then just take a picture of
          me, fighting with my Polish
          brethren. Gentlemen, I'm going in.

Benji salutes and runs to the monument.       He positions himself
cutely among the huge bronze soldiers.

                    DAVID
          You look great, Benji. I got some
          good shots.

                    BENJI
          Yeah?? Does it look real?

                     DAVID
          Well they're twice the size of you.
          And metal.

                    BENJI
          I know! I need some back up!        Come
          on up here with me, dude!

                       DAVID
          Benji, no.     Really.   Plea se.
                                                         31

                    BENJI
          Eloge, you gonna enlist?

                    ELOGE
          I'm not a fighter, Benji, thank
          you.

                    BENJI
          Okay, well you can be a medic or
          something! Come on up! It'll be
          funny! Your mom will love the
          pictures.

Eloge looks to David.

                    ELOGE
          This is so silly.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I know.

                    ELOGE
              (Handing David his phone)
          Can you take a picture of me?

                     DAVID
          Oh.   Really? Sure, I guess so.

Eloge joins Benji under the monument.

                    BENJI
          Okay, so you're the medic -- maybe
          you just jumped out of a copter and
          you got a fuckin first aid kit and
          you're patching up this guy's leg
          here.

Eloge laughs and kneels next to one of the bronze soldiers,
"patching up his leg."

                   BENJI
          Oh yeah! He's got gangrene.     Holy
          shit! It's fuckin oozing!

                    ELOGE
              (in character)
          Don't worry. I have prepared for
          this moment.

                    BENJI
          Of course you have. We got a young
          Florrie Nightingale ov er here!
          David, you gettin all this?
                                                         32

David is taking pictures on both guys' phones.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I got it.

                    BENJI
          Is it funny?

                    DAVID
          It's funny, yeah.

                    BENJI
          You sure you don't wanna come up
          here? We could use the manpower.

                    DAVID
          Nah, I'm good. I'll just... watch
          from "central command."

                    BENJI
          Ha! That's a good one Dave.
          "Central Command!"

Suddenly, Mark appears at the monument, posing next to Benji
and Eloge.

                     MARK
          Men?   Can I join up?

                    BENJI
          You bet, Marky Mark!

                     MARK
          Diane?   You getting this?

                    BENJI
          Hey! We got another man.     We're
          gonna take this hill.

David takes pictures. He enjoys seeing Benji so happy but is
also looking over his shoulder for security.

                    BENJI
          Jesus, this is a real fuckin'
          sausage party. Marcia, come on up
          here!

                    MARCIA
          I don't know.

                     BENJI
          Marcia Marcia Marcia!   Your country
          needs you!
                                                           33

                    MARCIA
          You're very persuasive, Benji.

                    BENJI
          I know! Give your phone to Davie,
          he's a great photographer.

Marcia gives her phone to David and heads up to the monument.

                    BENJI
          You wanna work with Eloge on this
          dude's leg?

                    MARCIA
          No, I'm a fighter.   Gimme a gun.

                      BENJI
          Ho ho ho!    Look at you!

Marcia pretends to be a soldier, finding it funny and
awkward.

David is now taking pictures with three people's phones.

                    BEN JI
          Okay, we got these fuckin Nazis
          right where we want `em. We need
          all hands on deck. Diane, James!
          Come on. Dave'll take the
          pictures. It'll be hysterical.

Diane brings her phone to David.

                    DIANE
          I can't believe I'm doing this.
          Thank you, David.

                      DAVID
          Sure.

Diane runs up next to her husband.    James approaches David
with his phone.

                    JAMES
          You sure don't want to go up?

                       DAVID
          Uh, yeah, I'm great. I got s ome
          good shots earlier when it was
          empty, so...

                    JAMES
          Oh, I feel bad, this is your tour.
                                                         34

                    BENJI
              (a British accent)
          Jimothy! We need a gunnah' from
          the RAF!

                    JAMES
          I'm coming!
              (to David:)
          And you really don't mind taking a
          picture?

                    DAVID
          No, it's fine.

James hands David his phone and joins the group.   Now
everyone is posing on the monument except David who has to
take pictures with five cameras.

                    BENJI
          Okay, everyone pick a pose and
          freeze in it so Dave could take a
          picture. Is that cool with you
          Dave?

                       DAVID
          Yup.

They all freeze as David takes a picture on each phone. It's
awkward for him as he has to put the phones in his pocket to
make sure he gets a shot on each one.

                    BENJI
          You almost done Dave? My arms are
          gettin tired.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I got it.

David takes a shot with the last phone.

                       BENJI
          Okay, men!     Stand down!

They all kind of laugh and walk off the monument.

                     BENJI
          You were all incredibly brave.
          Un fortunately, we lost the war big
          time.

They all laugh as Benji approaches David.
                                                           35

                    BENJI
          Thank you so much, dude. That was
          so fuckin fun.


EXT. WARSAW HOTEL - NIGHT

The group enters the hotel, the nice energy from the day
lingering in the air. David feels a bit left out.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

David and Benji ride up in the elevator with Eloge, Diane and
Mark. It stops on Benji and David's floor.

                    BENJI
          This is us. Good night you freaks.
          Long day tomorrow.

They ad lib goodni ghts to Benji.


EXT. WARSAW HOTEL HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

The boys walk down the hall towards the room.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

David and Benji enter their room.

                       BENJI
          Hey Dave.

                       DAVID
          Yeah?

                    BENJI
          Come in the bathroom with me for a
          sec.

                       DAVID
          What? Why?


INT. WARSAW HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

David squeezes into the cramped bathroom.   Benji closes the
door.

                    DAVID
          Why are we in here?
                                                            36

                    BENJI
              (huddling up intensely)
          I just wanna thank you so much for
          doin this with me. I know it was
          tough for you to take off work,
          leave your little boy. But I didn't
          realize I how much I needed this.

                    DAVID
          Well that's great, man. I'm happy
          to... see you happy. I know it's
          been a tough few months-

                     BENJI
          --And I also wanted to say that I
          know you're not the most
          comfortable person with groups and
          peopl e and social shit like that.

                       DAVID
          I'm not?

                    BENJI
          No. So it's amazing that you're
          here and puttin yourself out there
          so boldly for me.

                       DAVID
          Seriously?

                       BENJI
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          Thanks, man.

                    BENJI
          Good. Now let's go back out there
          and share a J.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM -       NIGHT

Benji exits the bathroom walks straight to the window and
opens it. But it only opens a few inches.

                    BENJI
          Yo, look at this fuckin
          infantilizing, corporate bullshit.

                    DAVID
          What do you mean?
                                                         37

                    BENJI
          We can't smoke with this shit open
          two inches.

                    DAVID
          Yo, I think I might just wanna
          crash, man. We've been up for like
          24 hours.

                    BENJI
          Don't say you're going to sleep on
          me, Davie. This is our first night
          together in fuckin years.

                    DAVID
          I don't know. I'm exhausted and I
          haven't showered.

                    BENJI
          Yo, the weed will help you sleep.

                    DAVID
          Is it the kind that helps you
          sleep?

                     BENJI
          No, it's the other kind.
              (D avid laughs)
          Listen: You take a shower -- do
          whatever you gotta do to feel like
          you -- and I'll roll us a fat ass
          blunt and we'll go on the roof.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

David, freshly dressed and Benji, fat ass blunt in his ear,
ride the elevator. There's a fun spirit in the air.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL HALLWAY OF TOP FLOOR -- NIGHT

The boys exit the elevator.

                    BENJI
              (like a dowser)
          Okay, okay, which w ay are you?

                    DAVID
          Uh, maybe they don't make their
          roof accessible for American
          assholes trying to smoke weed--

But Benji is already walking down the hallway.
                                                             38

At the end of the hallway is a door with a sign in Polish and
an alarm.

                    BENJI
          You think this is it?

                    DAVID
          I think there's a big fucking alarm
          that's gonna go off.

                    BENJI
          So if it does, we just say we don't
          speak Polish. Which is true.

David is backing away.

                    DAVID
          Benji, let's just go back down.

                      BENJI
          Okay.    I guess you're right, Dave.

Benji walks with David and then, suddenly, turns back and
runs toward the do or, slamming it open--

                      DAVID
          Benji!

But there's no alarm.    It's quiet. David is relieved.

Benji looks at David with an electricity in his eyes.

                    BENJI
          Apres vous...


INT. WARSAW HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

The boys giggle as they race up the stairwell.

Benji opens the door to the roof --


EXT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOF -- NIGHT

The boys are at the edge of the roof, which overlooks Warsaw.
It's gorgeous.

Benji exhales a huge h it, passes it to David, who takes a
hit. Passes it back.

                    BENJI
          There's my guy. How you feeling,
          dude?
                                         39

          DAVID
    (enjoying it)
I'm okay.

          BENJI
    (Intensely)
Yo. How you feeling dude?

          DAVID
I feel good. I feel good.

          BENJI
See? You just needed a little
drugs in your system.

             DAVID
Oh yeah?     That's all I was missing?

            BENJI
Yeah.    You're like an awesome guy
stuck   inside the body of someone
who's   always running late. And I
gotta   fish that awesome guy out
every   time I see you.

          DAVID
Thank you, I guess?

          BENJI
When I think of us, I think of us
walking around New York all night.
Seeing if we could make it through
til morning.

          DAVID
You always did.

          BENJI
And you'd always fall asleep
halfway through. We'd make it over
the Willie B and you'd conk out on
a bench in Chinatown.

             DAVID
I know.

          BENJI
You were kind of a light weight.

             DAVID
I'm sorry.

          BENJI
I'd have to stay up and keep watch.
                                                             40

                     DAVID
          Oh.

                    BENJI
          Make sure you weren't pecked to
          death by pigeons.

David laughs - but the mood has shifted a bit sour. David
looks at Benji as Benji exhales a huge puff.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The boys ride back down the elevator in silence.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The boys lie on their separate beds. They're eating chips
from the mini bar and Benji is nursing a little bottle of
vodka.

T he TV is playing the cheesy hotel menu on a loop.   They
stare at it, stoned and mesmerized.

                     BENJI
          Dave.

                     DAVID
          Yo.

Pause.

                    BENJI
          I'm sorry I called you a light
          weight.

                    DAVID
          It's okay. I'm sorry I would
          always fall asleep.

                    BENJI
          It's okay. You had like a job and
          a wife. You were awake all day,
          doing important shit.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I guess.

                    BENJI
          You're not a light weight.

                    DAVID
          Thanks Benji.
                                                          41

                    BENJI
          You were the only person who even
          tried to stay up with me.

Benji takes a swig of vodka and becomes contemplative:

                    BENJI
          I always wanted to hang out at
          night, when everyone else was gone -
          to have the city to ourselves. But
          I could never get anybody to come
          with me.

They eat their chips in silence.

                    BENJI
          I didn't care that you fell asleep.
          I was just happy you were there.

David nods, touched.

CUE: Chopin's Nocturne Op. 15 No. 1


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

David wakes up.   He looks over to the other bed:

Benji is still sleeping. A few more mini vodka bottles lie
around his head.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING

David is in the bathroom, whispering on FaceTime with Priya.
She's telling him a story about Abe and he's laughing.

David is in the shower. Shaving.

David swallows one of his pill s, drinking from the faucet.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

David reenters the room, freshly showered. Benji is still
sleeping. David stands over his cousin, looking at him.

In his sleep, Benji has a pained look on his face.

                    DAVID
          Benji.
              (Benji sleepily swats him)
          Benji, dude. We gotta go. Train's
          in an hour. Everyone's downstairs.
                                                            42

Benji groans.


INT. WARSAW HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING

Benji reluctantly trudging through the hall, following David.


EXT. WARSAW HOTEL - MORNING

The group is waiting outside for the boys.

                    DAVID
          Hi, guys. Sorry we're a little
          late.

Benji perks up when he sees everyone, his erratic charisma
suddenly alighting.

                    BENJI
          Dave literally woke me up two
          minutes ago. Ha.


INT. WARSAW TRAIN STATION - DAY

The group walks throu gh the train station.   Benji takes it
all in like a little kid.


INT. WARSAW TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY

The group approaches the train.   James leads them to the
front.

                    JAMES
          Luckily, included in your tour fee,
          we all get first class seats -- not
          too bad, huh?

                    MARCIA
          Ooh, fancy.

                    DIANE
          Love the exchange rate.

As they board the train, David looks happy, Benji looks
skeptical.


EXT. TRAIN - DAY

Moving southeast t hrough Central Poland's Countryside.
                                                         43

INT. TRAIN - DAY

The group rides in a sparsely filled first class car. They
each have a nice breakfast meal on trays in front of them and
are eating their food as they listen to James.

                    JAMES
          And if we have time, I think
          Underground Lublin is a
          fascinating, if overhyped,
          destination. But the real heart of
          the city is the Grodzka gate...

As James continues, Benji turns and whispers to David.

                     BENJI
          Yo du de, I think we should move.

                       DAVID
          What?

                    BENJI
          I think we should move to a
          different train car.

                    DAVID
          What do you mean?

                    BENJI
          Don't you feel weird being in a
          first class car?

                    DAVID
          No. We paid for it. It's not
          hurting anybody.

                   BENJI
          Dude. We are Jews on a train in
          Poland. Think about it.

James notices Benji-

                    JAMES
          Benji, is everything okay?

                    DAVID
          Yes, it's fine. We're fine. Sorry
          about that.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, sorry about that J.
                                                             44

                    JAMES
          Of course. No worries. So as I
          was saying, the lantern was not ex--

Benji can't help himself.    He addresses the group-

                    BENJI
          I just feel like -- is no one else
          feeling this?

Pause--

                    MARCIA
          Feeling what?

                    BENJI
          Just the creepy feeling of being,
          like, royalty on this train, you
          know? Does anyone not see the
          irony here?

                    DAVID
          Benji, please -

                    BENJI
          Like eating this fancy food?
          Sitting up here when, eighty y ears
          ago we would have been herded into
          the backs of these things like
          fuckin' cattle--

                    MARCIA
          Oh, come on, Benji, stop that--

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I don't think everyone wants
          to hear that--

                    BENJI
          Well, why not--

                    DAVID
          Because it's depressing--

                    JAMES
          No it's okay. If I may: Benji
          raises an interesting sensitivity.
          People often have the experience,
          coming here on these tours, staying
          in nice hotels, eating nice food,
          while exploring the horrors of
          their family's lives.

The group takes this in.    Benji nods, feeling validated.
                                                 45

                    JAMES
          There's certainly feelings of
          discomfort and even a kind of
          guilt, of comparing their lives to
          those who--

                    MARK
          I don't feel guilt.

                    JAMES
          Nor should you.

                    MARK
          Why would I feel guilt?

                    JAMES
          I'm not suggesting you should, Mark-

Benji is reactivated!

                    BENJI
          Because our lives are so fuckin
          pampered and privileged! Like we
          completely cut ourselves off from
          anyone's else true pain -- like the
          actual experience of being shoved
          into a train car, your fuckin head
          bashed in--

                    MARK
          So what are we supposed to do about
          that?

                    DIANE
          Mark, please--

                    BENJI
          Uh, I don't know-- Acknowledge it
          maybe? Try to feel it in some way?

                    DAVID
          Benji, why are you doing this?

                    BENJI
          I'm just sayin how I feel, Dave.

                    DAVID
          And why is that important now?

Some titters from the group.
                                                        46

                    BENJI
          Yo, Dave, you used to feel
          everything. He was such an
          adorable, anxious kid!

                    DAVID
          Benji, Jesus--

                    BENJI
          We went to Jewy sleep-away camp
          together and he cried the whole
          first week cause he was homesick.
          Literally the whole week.

                    DAVID
          Benji, what the fuck!

                    BENJI
          And I would have to hug him to
          sleep and talk about his sweet
          fuckin mom to calm him down. And
          now look at him. Comfortable,
          buttoned up, topiaries his wild ass
          Jew fro into submission.

                    DAVID
          Benji!

                    BENJI
          It's all mad impressive.

The group is mildly appalled.

                     BENJI
          You're all mad impressive. But I
          think I'm gonna move to the back of
          the train.

                    MARK
          I don't think you'll find much
          suffering back there either.

                    DIANE
          -Mark, stop it.

Benji, deflated, walks away. David turns back and watches
him go, mystified by his behavior.

                    JAMES
          I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable
          for anyone. These triggers
          certainly do arise anywhere.
          Usually not on a moving train, but-
                                                              47

Some laughter from the group -

                    DAVID
          Hey, James? I should probably go
          back there. At least bring him his
          food.

                    JAMES
          Of course. Of course. You know
          where to get off?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, Lublin Glowny? I must be
          mispronouncing it.

                    JAMES
          Don't worry � you're very close.
          It's the next stop.

David picks up Benji's food tray and heads back.


INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

David is walking through a more crowded part of the train ,
looking for Benji. He doesn't see him.


INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - DAY

David enters the next car.     Halfway down, he sees Benji,
sitting alone.

David sits next to him.    It's a quiet and sweet moment.

                       DAVID
          Hey man.

David undoes Benji's tray and sets his food down.

                       BENJI
          Thanks.

                    DAVID
          Are you okay?

                    BENJI
              (sadly)
          Everyone just wants to have a
          fuckin joyride, you know?

                    DAVID
          What do you mean?
                                                           48

                    BENJI
          People can't just walk around the
          world being... happy all the time.

                    DAVID
              (gently)
          It's okay, man.

Benji digs into his food. David leans back, tired.


EXT. POLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The train speeds past us in various locations.


INT. TRAIN - DAY

Moving down the aisle, we find David fast asleep in his seat,
Benji just watching him.

The train pulls into a station and David startles awake.

                    BENJI
              (calmly)
          Hey m an.

                    DAVID
          Did I fall asleep?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, you did.

                    DAVID
          All right, well let's go. Come on.

David grabs his bag and heads for the exit.    Benji follows,
looking guilty.


EXT. KRASNIK PLATFORM - DAY

The boys emerge onto the platform and begin walking toward
the exit. Behind them, the train pulls away.

David looks around the platform.

                    DAVID
          I guess everyone's waiting outside
          for us.

                      BENJI
          Hey Dave.
                                                             49

                      DAVID
          Yeah?

                    BENJI
          We're not at the right train
          station.

                    DAVID
          What do you mean?

David looks around.   He sees the large station sign says,
"Krasnik."

                    DAVID
          Oh shit. What the fuck is Krasnik?
          We're supposed to get off at
          Lublin.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, you were out pretty fuckin
          cold.

                    DAVID
          You mean, we passed Lublin already?

                    BENJI
          A while ago.

                    DAVID
          And you didn't wake me up?

                    BENJI
          You were gettin such a good nap,
          dude.

                      DAVID
          J esus!

                    BENJI
          Dave, you were drooling and snoring
          and everything, I couldn't bring
          myself to wake you up.

                    DAVID
          You have like the most fucked up
          sense of priorities.

David begins walking toward the station exit. Benji hustles
up--

                    BENJI
          Dave, come on. Don't be mad at me.
                                                50

                    DAVID
          How could I not be mad at you?

                    BENJI
          Cause I was staring at you sleepin.
          And you were snoring so weirdly and
          loudly and everyone was lookin and
          some people were laughing and I was
          just thinkin: this is my cousin,
          Davey. I'm not ashamed of him.
          This is Davey On The Bench in
          Chinatown. This is the cousin I
          used to have all to myself.

David softens and turns back around.

                    DAVID
          All right, so what d o we do now?

                    BENJI
          Oh, I already worked all that shit
          out.

                     DAVID
          Did you?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, while you were sleeping.

                    DAVID
          Great. What do you got?

                    BENJI
          Lublin was the last stop, right?
          So we hop onto the train on the
          other side of the platform, going
          in the opposite direction. And
          that'll take us back to Lublin.
          Just email James and tell him we
          got a little sidetracked.

                     DAVID
          Huh.   Okay.

                    BENJI
          And we don't even need to get
          tickets.

                    DAVID
          What do you mean?

                    BENJI
          I mean, we're only tryin to go one
          stop, right?
                                                         51
                    BENJI (CONT'D)
          We just gotta avoid the conductor
          til we get there. I do shit like
          this all the time upstate. It's
          fuckin fool proof.
              (looks across the
               platform)
          All right - here we go!


MOMENTS LATER

The boys sprint around to the train on the opposing platform.
A CONDUCTOR is near a car at the front.

                    DAVID
          We should just buy tickets like
          normal people.

                     BENJI
          No time.   Come on!

The boys run down the platform to enter t he back of the
train. Benji nods to David like they're preparing for a bank
heist and they hop on.


INT. TRAIN - DAY

The boys move through the train, heading towards the front.

                    BENJI
          We stay moving, we stay light, we
          stay agile. He's gonna be coming
          through the train, takin tickets.
          We pass him -- probably somewhere
          around the middle of the train- and
          we tell him we're goin to the
          bathroom. Then he's gonna get to
          the back of the train and start
          heading back up toward the front
          lookin for stragglers.

                    DAVID
          We're the stragglers?

                    BENJI
          Yes. And by the time he gets to
          the front, the train'll be in the
          station and we'll be home free.

                    DAVID
          This is so fucking stupid.
                                                        52

                    BENJI
          No, what's stupid is the
          corporatization of travel.
          Ensuring the rich move around the
          world to propagate their elitist
          loins while the poor stay cut off
          from society.

                    DAVID
          That's good - we can argue Marxism
          when they're hauling us off to
          Siberia.

                    BENJI
          Siberia's in Russia, Dave.

They enter the next car--

                    DAVID
          This is ridiculous. Tickets are
          probably like twelve bucks!

                    BENJI
          It's the principle of th e thing.
          We shouldn't have to pay for train
          tickets in Poland. This is our
          country!

                    DAVID
          No it's not! It WAS our country.
          They kicked us out because they
          thought we were cheap!

The boys enter the next car. David is increasingly nervous.
They see the conductor enter from the other side.

                    CONDUCTOR
              (In Polish)
          Tickets. Have your tickets ready.

                    BENJI
          This is it, buddy.    Stay calm, act
          natural.

They appr oach the conductor:

                    BENJI
          Hi! Just bathroom. Me and cousin
          go to just bathroom, thank you.

                    CONDUCTOR
              (In perfect English)
          Bathroom's on either side.
                                                         53

                    BENJI
          With thanks. Thank you.

                    DAVID
          Yes, thank you.

The boys exit the car and catch their breath in the
vestibule.

                    DAVID
          Jesus, my heart's in my fucking
          throat!

                    BENJI
          Feels good, doesn't it? But we're
          not out of the woods yet. We get
          to the front and take shelter til
          we get to our stop.

As the boys make their way through the cars, something
loosens inside David. We move past Benji and closer on David
a s a nostalgic smile grows on his face.


INT. FRONT CAR - DAY

The boys enter the front car and find seats. They plop down,
ecstatic.

                    DAVID
          We made it.

                    BENJI
          Don't fall asleep on me again,
          brother.

                     DAVID
          I won't.
              (Looks around)
          Hey Benji.

                       BENJI
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          We're in first class.

Benji looks around, thinks about it.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, but we fuckin earned it.
                                                             54

EXT. LUBLIN STATION -- DAY

The train pulls into the Lublin Glowny Station.   The boys
walk along the platform, looking for the exit.


EXT. LUBLIN STATION - DAY

The boys emerge to find James and the group, in various
stages of irritation.

                    BENJI
          Hey everybody. I'm super sorry
          we're late. Dave fell asleep.


EXT. STAIRS TO CASTLE - DAY

The group ascends the massive staircase that leads to the
castle.

                     JAMES
          I wan t today to be as vibrant as it
          is melancholic. Lublin has such a
          rich Jewish history. It was
          actually called The Jewish Oxford.
          It was diverse, intellectually and
          culturally. It was progressive,
          open, welcoming. And it's hard to
          say whether the Jewish community
          was attracted to Lublin for these
          reasons or if the Jewish community
          was responsible for these local
          virtues. It's probably a little o f
          both.
          But I want today to feel
          enlightening. To understand the
          scope and importance of Jewish
          contributions. This is the Lublin
          of Rebbe Horowitz, the Seer of
          Lublin, of Isaac Bashevis Singer,
          of poets, writers, merchants,
          intellectuals.


EXT. BRIDGE FROM ZAMKOWA STREET - DAY

The group walks along the gorgeous bridge to the gate.    David
approaches Eloge:

                    DAVID
          So, you're like really religious?
                                                            55

                    ELOGE
          Yes, I am David.

                    DAVID
          That's amazing to me.

                      ELOGE
          Is it?

                      DAVID
          Yeah.    You do all the customs?

                    ELOGE
          Not all, but I do keep Shabbat.
          It's mediative, it gives me a
          chance to unwind, to refocus. And
          you?

                    DAVID
          No. The whole thing always seemed
          like a little archaic and arbitrary
          and mechanical to me. No offense.

                    ELOGE
          None taken, but I think it would
          really benefit you.

                    DAVID
          You mean like benefit everyo ne or,
          like, me specifically?

                    ELOGE
          You specifically.

Up ahead, Marcia approaches Benji.   David looks on--

                      MARCIA
          Benji-

                      BENJI
          Yo.

                    MARCIA
              (chuckling)
          "Yo."

They walk a little bit.   They like each other's company.

                    MARCIA
          I wanted to say that I've been
          thinking about what you said on the
          train. About understanding
          suffering. It really stirred me.
                                                56

                    BENJI
          Yo, seriously Marcia?

                      MARCIA
          Yes.

                      BENJI
          Dope.

                    MARCIA
          You know, last year, my daughter
          married a very rich man-

                      BENJI
          -Oh fuck-

                    MARCIA
          -And she can barely have a
          conversation with any depth
          anymore. She's lost any
          perspective on the real world.

                    BENJI
          Of course she has! Money's like
          fuckin heroin for boring people.

                    MARCIA
          Well, I don't know what that means.
          But it's so easy to float through
          life, forgetting how lucky we are.

                      BENJI
          Exactly!

                    DAVID
          See, Benji? Look at that!    You're
          an inspiration.

Marcia side-eyes David as Eloge approaches.

                    ELOGE
          Hi, yes, I'm eavesdropping, is that
          okay?

                    BENJI
          Of course, Eloge, come on in!

Eloge sidles up, David getting sidelined--

                    ELOGE
          I want to echo what Marcia said, if
          that's all right.
                                                           57

                    BENJI
          Really?

                    DAVID
          Really?

                    ELOGE
          Yes, of course. I find myself
          constantly baffled by the way the
          world seems to carry on like there
          aren't a million reasons to mourn,
          to be shocked, to be appalled.

                    BENJI
          Yo, that's what I'm saying!

David can't believe Benji is getting this reaction.   He
reinserts himself-

                    DAVID
          I don't know. If we wept for every
          sad thing in the world, what would
          that accomplish?

                    BENJI
          Uh, maybe sad shit wouldn't
          constantly happen?

                    MARCIA
          Exactly. David, we numb ourselves
          to avoid thinking about the impact
          we have-

                    ELOGE
          Ignoring the proverbial slaughter
          house to enjoy the steak, as it
          were-

                    BENJI
          Yes, Eloge! Damn, that's a good
          analogy.

                    DAVID
          And I get all that. It just seems
          like there's a time and a place for
          grieving and maybe it's-

                    BENJI
          Dave, we're on a fuckin Holocaust
          tour. If now isn't the time and
          place to grieve, to open up, then I
          don't know what to tell you, man.

Benji walks on and his new minions, Eloge and Marcia.
                                                            58

David slows down, contemplating.   They approach the central
gate.

                    JAMES
          If I can get everyone's attention.
          This is the famous Grodzka Gate or,
          as it was once known, The Jewish
          Gate. On the other side of this
          gate was the Jewish Quarter. As we
          walk through, I want you to try to
          imagine what life must have been
          like here hundreds of years ago.
          The parking lots, the hair salons,
          the recently paved roads used to be
          Jewish houses, synagogues, shops.
          Try to avoid conjuring images of
          the horrors-to-come and just
          imagine a vibrant city.

On David and Benji, passing through light patches of the dark
tunnel--

                    JAMES
          Try to imagine what could have
          been, the promise, the hope--

The group passes through the tunnel, emerging into the light.


EXT. LUBLIN - MONTAGE

Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 plays over the following:

                    JA MES (VO)
          The memories of Jewish life are
          here, but they're hidden around
          this city, moments trapped in
          amber. There aren't monuments or
          statues. The only synagogue is a
          now-defunct second floor office
          building. But there are little
          moments of history frozen in time,
          peeking out, waiting for us.
          Emblems of a people, of stories, of
          contributions.

As he speaks, we see a montage of shots from around the city:

-An unremarkable grocery store with a plaque above the door

                    JAMES (VO)
          A former Yiddish theater.

-A medical academy building, the site of a former Yeshiva
                                                          59

                    JAMES (VO)
          A former Yeshiva.

-Hebrew letters in relief on the side of a building

                    JAMES (VO)
          A former Hebrew printing house.


EXT. GRAVEL STREET - AFTERNOON

In a wide tableau, the group ambles along this uneven path at
the edge of town. Benji throws his arm around David and
pinches his cheek.


EXT. CEMETERY � DUSK

At the top of the hill is the Jewish cemetery, a rough patch
of land with scattered tombsto nes.

The group naturally fans out, taking it all in.   Eloge
lingers around James--

                    JAMES
          So there's a bit of a discrepancy
          about the founding of the cemetery
          but most have it pegged at 1541.
          Think about that. Before the
          founding of the United States,
          before Shakespeare, before the
          locomotive. And, if I may, the
          oldest tombstone in all of Poland
          is actually here.

                    ELOGE
          Ah, yes, Kopleman, right?

                     JAMES
          D ing ding ding.   That's right,
          Eloge.

                    ELOGE
          I read about it this morning.
          Don't be too impressed.

                    JAMES
          He's actually buried right back
          here. It's rather unremarkable if
          you don't know the history--

As James and Eloge continue, Benji rolls his eyes at David.
                                                             60

David responds with a quizzical expression, like "What's
wrong?"

Benji claps one hand together and motions toward James, as if
to say "James won't shut the fuck up."

David looks at Benji like, "Who the fuck cares?"

Benji responds with an expression like, "I fucking care."

Benji starts heading over to James.   David knows it's not
good.

                    BENJI
          Hey James, Eloge--

                       DAVID
          Oh shit--

                       BENJI
          Yo, James.

                       DAVID
          Benji--

                     JAMES
          Y es, Benji.

                    BENJI
          You're like completely
          knowledgeable about all this shit
          and it's mad impressive and we all
          know that now but like �

                    DAVID
          Benji- stop it.

                    BENJI
          But like these are real people.
          These are not little factoids lying
          under here. Okay? They're not
          history lessons.

                    DAVID
          Benji, calm down.

                    BENJI
          Hold up, Davie.

                    JAMES
          I'm sorry, Benji, did I say
          something to upset you?
                                                         61

                    BENJI
          I mean, you know your shit, don't
          get me wrong. And Eloge, you
          totally know your shit, which is
          doubly impressive. But it's just
          like, the constant barrage of stats
          is kinda making this trip a little
          cold, you know?

Eloge looks down at the ground, embarrassed.

                    JAMES
              (trying for levity)
          I'm sorry. It's the Brit in me.

                    BENJI
          And, like, part of the problem, if
          we're bein honest right now, with
          the tour is that we've been cut off
          from anything real.

                       JAMES
          Excuse me?

                    DAVID
          Benji- what the hell-

                    BENJI
          Don't take this the wrong way or
          anything, but we've just been going
          from one touristy thing to another,
          not meeting anyone who's actually
          Polish-

                    JAMES
          Benji, I'm sorry to say this, but
          that's kind of what these tours
          are. You signed up for this tour.

                    BENJI
          Dave signed up for the tour.

James is incredibly uncomfortable. He looks to David, who is
mortified. After a pause, Benji releases the tension--

                    BENJI
          And it's a mostly amazing tour,
          Jimbo. Like, really. I'm lovin it
          and it's totally Dave's speed. But
          maybe just chill with the facts and
          figures for a little bit. Is that
          cool?
                                                          62

                    JAMES
              (regaining his composure)
          Yes, we could certainly tone it
          down for a bit, sure. In fact, I
          was going to suggest that we all
          place a small rock or pebble on Mr.
          Kopleman's stone.

                    DAVID
          That sounds like a great idea.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, dude, that's what I'm talking
          about. Thanks J. Thanks E.

                       JAMES
          Of course.

                       ELOGE
          Yes.

James, still rattled, calls the group over to Kopleman.

                    JAMES
          Um, if I can get everyone to j oin
          me over here. This stone here is
          thought to be the oldest tombstone
          in Poland. It's a man called Jacob
          Kopleman Levi, who was a real
          person. A real Polish person...
          from Poland-

James and Benji exchange looks.   Benji nods a little like,
"you can continue."

                    JAMES
          And Benji had a wonderful idea of
          taking a moment of silence and
          placing a rock on Mr. Kopleman's
          grave. There are many theories as
          to why Jews follow this tradition,
          why they place stones on graves,
          but I like to think it's done to
          say: You are not forgotten.

There's a sweet pause--

                    BENJI
          That was great James.

                    JAMES
          Thank you, Benji. So, lets find
          some nice stones, shall we?
                                                              63

                    MARCIA
          I think that's a lovely idea.

                    BENJI
          Thanks Marcia.

The group begins looking for pebbles on the ground.    David
finds two and offers one to Benji.

                    DAVID
          You want this one?

                    BENJI
              (dismissive)
          No, it's too small.

                    DAVID
          Okay.

                    BENJI
          But you can totally use it.

Benji finds two stones.   He approaches Marcia.

                    BENJI
          Yo, did you find one Marcia?

                    MARCIA
          I did not, Benji.

                    BENJI
          Take one of mine.

                    MARCIA
          That's very kind, than k you.

David notices their interaction.    He feels irked by Benji.

David looks back to James and tries to apologize for Benji
with his eyes. James waves him off, like, "Don't worry about
it."

The group ends up forming a little line at Kopleman's grave.

Mark and Diane place their stones down, followed by Eloge,
James and David. It's all very somber and sweet.

Marcia and Benji approach.    Marcia places h er stone down
first.

David, Eloge and James watch as Benji jokes around with
Marcia:
                                                          64

                    BENJI
          You're gonna put it there?

                    MARCIA
          Is there something wrong with where
          I'm putting it?

                    BENJI
          Everyone knows it's sacrilege to
          put a rock on the north side of a
          grave.

                    MARCIA
          Well, that's fine because I'm an
          atheist.

                    BENJI
          Oooh, damn girl!

David shares looks with Eloge and James -- they're all pissed
that Benji's allowed to change the mood whenever it suits
him.

As we pull back on the group on the hill, t he sun is nearly
setting and music comes up:

It's piano but for the first time, it's not Chopin.

In fact, it sounds like a moody version of Hava Nagila.   It
carries us into:


EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Establish a lively restaurant in old town Lublin.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A pianist plays the familiar Hava Nagila. We move off of the
pianist to find our group sitting in this cozy, old style
restaurant. They are through dinner, sipping drinks. The
mood feels light, except Benji who is stewing.

                    MARCIA
          And my father's brother was the
          real brains of the family. He was
          rejected from medical school
          because of quotas, you know, on
          Jewish doctors or what have you.
          I'm sorry -- I'm just having trouble
          competing with Hava Nagila--
                                                    65

                    JAMES
          Yes, we stop here on every tour,
          the food is wonderful, but the
          music can be a little kitschy-

                    BENJI
          Antisemitic pricks.

                    JAMES
              (Annoyed by Benji but
               being polite)
          Well, I don't know if it's
          antisemitic, the owners are Jewish.
          But I do think they try to create a
          kind of "authentic" atmosphere.

                     BENJI
          Yeah, it's totally authentic to
          essentialize a 5000 year old
          history with a jappy Bar Mitzvah
          song. Pl ease continue, Marcia.

                    MARCIA
          I'll try. So. My Uncle Sam
          couldn't go to medical school so he
          became a pharmacist. The next best
          thing in his mind. And he ended up
          owning five pharmacies in and
          around Chicago -- and we're talking
          big places, with soda fountains and
          the whole thing. And he started
          what we now think of as a modern
          drug store - with food and
          electronics.

The group ad libs- impressed with Marcia's story.

And the piano player finishes the song.

                    MARCIA
          Ah, now the song's over. Just as
          I'm done, my usual good timing.

                    JAMES
          That story is amazing   Marcia. The
          ingenuity to create a   pharmacy
          because he was barred   from medical
          school speaks volumes   about the
          immigrant experience.

                    ELOGE
          I can attest to that, absolutely.
                                                         66

                     DIANE
           Oh yes, my great uncle came off the
           boat from Poland, landed in
           Galveston for some fakakta reason--

They all chuckle a bit.

                    DIANE
          And made money by taking the
          furniture that rich people threw
          out on the street, refurbishing it
          and reselling. True story-

                    MARK
          And apparently he ended up selling
          some of it back to the original
          owners.

They all laugh --

                    BENJI
          Rich people are fuckin idiots.

There's a slight pause in the group as they're thrown off by
Benji's crassness. David picks up the mood--

                     DAVID
           Well, our grandmother--

                     BENJI
           Grandma Dory--

                    DAVID
          Yeah, Grandma Dory, who's house
          we're seeing on Thursday, was just
          amazing too.

                    JAMES
          Please regale us!

                     DAVID
          Yeah, she was just one of    these
          bygone, realist types you    don't see
          anymore. Blunt and tough--   I was
          scared shitless of her my    whole
          childhood.

                    BENJI
          I was never scared of her.

                     DAVID
           That's true! She and Benji had
           some special secret language. They
           both said what was on their minds--
                                                              67

                       BENJI
          No choice.

                    DAVID
          And a similar kind of story to you
          Marcia and to you Diane. She
          survived the camps through a
          thousand miracles and made her way
          to New York. She wanted to design
          dresses but couldn't afford fashion
          school so she got stuck working as
          a secretary.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, but she was like "fuck this."
          She ended up taking over the whole
          company.

                    DAVID
          You're making it sound like she led
          a junta or something. She was just
          super smart. I mean, it was a small
          commercial real estate company.

                    BENJI
          I used to speak to her every
          Thursday. Literally every Thursday.

                    MARCIA
          That's nice, Benji. If my kids
          call me once a month, it's a shock.

                    BENJI
          Oh, Marcia, I'm sorry, fuck them. I
          wouldn't miss a week. She was tough
          on me. She was the only one in the
          whole fuckin family who would keep
          me honest. Ev eryone else just
          disappeared when I needed them
          most.

There's a weird silence at the table because of his admission
and because David is being implicated.

                    JAMES
          She sounds really special.

Benji nods to himself.    David stares at Benji, guilty and
also irritated.

                    DAVID
          But grandma never pitied herself --
          she said she was grateful for her
          struggle.
                                                         68

                    MARCIA
          Well, that's just it. She had
          meaning in her life, look what she
          endured, it gave her hope-

                    DAVID
          Exactly. She used to tell me that
          first generation immigrants work
          some menial job -- they drive cabs,
          they deliver food -- but they move
          their family up to the middle
          class. Then the second generation
          goes to good schools, good
          colleges, they become a lawyer or a
          doctor. And the third generatio n
          lives in their mother's basement
          and smokes pot all day.

David laughs a bit but then realizes what he just said. The
group is silently alarmed as they realize the grandma was
talking about Benji.

                    BENJI
          She said that?

                      DAVID
          Um... she was just speaking
          generally.

                    BENJI
          She really said that?

                    DAVID
          I think she was just talking about
          the immigrant experience.

                    BENJI
          I lived in my mom's basement.

                    DAVID
          Yo, Benji, sh e was talking about
          immigrants, that's all.

                    BENJI
          Huh. I didn't think you ever
          bothered to call her, Dave.

The group is feeling weird, David is insulted. Eloge helps:

                    ELOG
          She sounds like a fascinating
          person.

The group ad libs in agreement.
                                                            69

                    MARCIA
          I think we should toast to her.
          James, what's the Polish word for
          toasting?

                    JAMES
          Ah, yes, na zdrowie. With
          characteristic consonant blending.

                    MARCIA
          To Grandma Dory--

They all lift their glasses.

                    ALL
          To Grandma Dory.     Na zdrowie.

They all take a sip except Benji who stands up and chugs his
entire huge glass of beer.

The group looks on as Benji binges.    It takes a long time and
is awkward.

                     BENJI
          Well , I gotsta pee.    I'll be back-

Benji walks away.   There's a heavy feeling at the table.

                    DAVID
          I'm sorry about him.

                    DIANE
          What a troubled young man.

                    ELOGE
          He wants to be good � you can see
          the spark, do you know what I mean?

                    MARCIA
          Absolutely, Eloge.

                    MARK
          Forgive me if I don't see this
          magical spark.

                    DIANE
          Mark, stop it. He's tormented, for
          whatever reason.

                    MARCIA
          Exactly. And god, he's charming
          and funny under neath all the...
          mishigas.
                                                70

                    DIANE
          I feel bad for him.

                    MARCIA
          Was he always like this?

                    DAVID
          Yes! He's always been like, up and
          down. Like he's sensitive and he
          sees people so clearly but then you
          say the wrong thing and something
          switches. Sorry, maybe it's not
          appropriate to talk about him--

                    DIANE
          What's not appropriate? Stop it.
          You obviously have a lot going on
          with each other. And he's clearly
          in pain.

                    DAVID
          I know, but isn't everyone in pain
          in some way? Look where we came
          from. Look at what happened to our
          families. Who isn't wrought?

                    MARK
          Well, you seem okay.

                    DAVID
          I'm not. That's the thing! I have
          shit going on! I do. But I take a
          pill for my fuckin OCD, I jog, I
          meditate and I go to work and come
          home at the end of the day. I move
          forward. Because I know my pain is
          unexceptional so I don't feel the
          need to bur den everybody with it!

This lands with the group.

                    DAVID
          I'm sorry I'm ranting. I'm just so
          fucking exhausted by him sometimes.
          I love him and I hate him and I
          want to kill him and I want to be
          him and I feel so lame around him
          because he's so fucking cool and
          doesn't give a shit and then just
          being here with him is baffling
          because like... How did this guy
          come from the survivors of this
          place?
              (to Diane)
                                                 71
                    DAVID (CONT'D)
                     DAVID (CONT'D)
          That your uncle had to sell used
          furniture to rich assholes!
              (to Marcia)
          Or got rejected from Med School!
              (to Eloge)
          That you survived the most horrific
          thing to happen on this planet in
          the last thirty years!
              (a beat)
          That our grandmother survived when
          the whole world was trying to kill
          her! And I look at him and I just
          wanna ask him! I just wanna ask him
          and I just can't! How could a
          person who's th e product of a
          thousand fucking miracles overdose
          on a bottle of sleeping pills?!

The group is stunned.

                     MARCIA
          What?

                    DIANE
          What did you say?

                    DAVID
          Yeah. He tried to... yeah. I
          shouldn't have said anything.

                    JAMES
          No, it's okay. David, I'm sorry.

                    ELOGE
          How horrible.

                     MARCIA
          My god.   When did this happen?

                     DAVID
          Like six months ago. My aunt Leah --
          Benji's mom -- found him on the
          couch. I probably shouldn't have
          sa id anything. And I know he looks
          so charming and funny to you and
          you're all gonna walk away with the
          impression of this amazing man -
          which he totally is in so many ways
          - but when I picture him, it's
          passed out on this ratty basement
          couch and I'm in New York City with
          my nice wife and adorable child and
          it just fucking kills me.
                                                            72

David takes a sip of his beer.

                    DAVID
              (wryly)
          Sorry, I'm oversharing.

The group digests this bombshell but David feels a weight
lifted.

Suddenly, they hear the pianist again.   But this time,
they're playing a jazz riff.

                    DAVID
          Jesus Christ, they're back again--

They listen to the music for a second until Marcia peers past
David to see:

                      MARCIA
          It's him.

David turns around and looks:

A very drunk Benji is sitting at the piano. He's riffing on
a jazz standard. It's uncomplicated but deft and fun. He
has heart and some innate talent.

David watches him.

                    MARCIA
          Did you know he plays piano?

                    DAVID
              (somberly)
          We used to take lessons together.

David watches Benji play. Benji's eyes are closed and he is
in a zone. David doesn't know how to take it but he's moved.

The group watches Benji, a mixture of pity and awe.


IN T. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Benji is still playing, now flanked by Marcia and Diane. We
pan along the restaurant to find Dave sitting alone as the
other guys chat amongst themselves.

David stands up and decides to leave.
                                                                 73

      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      David emerges from the restaurant, alone. He can faintly
      hear Benji's music from inside the restaurant.
65B   As David begins walking back to the hotel, Benji's music 65B
      becomes more insistent and grating, needling it's way into
      David's subconscious.


      INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

      A bastardized version of Benji's music continues.

      From inside the lobby, we see David enter the Lubli n hotel.


      INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      David enters the room and the music in his head abruptly
      stops. He stands there in frustration for a minute.

      He walks to his bag and fishes out one of his pills.

      He dry swallows it. It gets caught in his throat and makes
      him choke a bit. He hits at his throat, pissed and miserable-


      LATER

      It's dark. David is still alone in the room. He's calling
      PRIYA on Fac etime but she's not picking up.


      LATER

      David is on the bed.   He takes his socks off and scoots back
      on the bed.

      He's looking at his bare feet, thinking.


      INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      It's the middle of the night.    David is sleeping.

      He hears Benji enter the room and he stirs awake.

      Not wanting to engage with Benji, David lies very still. He
      hears Benji rifle through some stuff and then leave the room.

      David is confused.   He sits up -- Benji is gone.

      David looks at the clock -- it's 2:40 AM.
                                                            74

INT. LUBLIN HALLWAY - DAY

David peeks his head out the room and looks down the empty
hallway.

                     DAVID
          Fuck...


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

David is throwing on clothes, irritated.


INT. LUBLIN HALLWAY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

David is walking through the hallway, looking for Benji.


INT. LUBLIN LOBBY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

David is talking to the front desk, who haven't seen Benji.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

David is stewing in his bed, pissed and worried about Benji.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

David is sleeping, sitting up in bed.     He had a rough night.

Suddenly, the room phone rings.    He startles awake.

                     DAVID
          Hello.

                    BENJI
              (on the phone)
          Dude, we're all downstairs waitin
          on you.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ELEVATOR � MORNING

David, now dressed, rides the elevator down.    He's pissed.


INT. LUBLIN LOBBY -- MORNING

David exits the elevator and walks to the lobby:

Benji is there, sitting with the group.
                                                       75

                    BENJI
          Mornin Davers. Your alarm clock
          didn't go off?

                    DAVID
              (bitter)
          No, my phone died because I didn't
          plug it in because I spent the
          night looking for you. Where the
          fuck were you?

                    BENJI
          Dude, I'm sorry. You were fast
          asleep when I left.

                    DAVID
          Well you scared the shit outta me,
          Benji.

                    BENJI
          Oh, man, I'm sorry.   I was just
          hangin with Marcia.   I didn't wanna
          wake you up.

James approaches the group --

                     JAMES
          Mo rning, gang.

The group says good morning to James --

                    JAMES
          Everybody's down so early, I love
          that. So. The van just pulled up.
          It's an eerily short drive.

They exit the hotel, David warily eyeing his cousin.


INT. VAN - DAY

The van drives on the outskirts of Lublin.

James is facing back to address the group.

David sits up front, Benji sits in the back.

                    JAMES
          So, this is going to be a taxing
          day. If you've never been to a
          concentration camp, it can
          obviously be pretty overwhelming.
                                                         76
                    JAMES (CONT'D)
                    JAMES (CONT'D)
          But reactions fall along a broad
          spectrum from numbing to complete
          distress and everything in between.

As James continues, David looks back to Benji, who's staring
out the window.

David looks out the window and sees the massive concentration
camp come into view--


EXT. MAJDANEK - DAY

The bus pulls in to the camp parking lot. It's eerily
sparse. Majdanek is essentially a preserved camp, unadorned
with the museum style of other Holocaust sites.

                    JAMES (VO)
          Well, it's weird to say it, but
          we're here.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The group files off the van.

                    JAMES
          Majdanek is literally only two
          miles from the Lublin town square.
          Can you imagine? Life was
          continuing, a bustling city, two
          miles from these grounds.

The group takes this in.

The group walks towards the entrance and we get a full sense
of the scope of this unnerving place.

Push past them to see the massive town just beyond the barbed
wire.


EXT. ENTRANCE AREA - DAY

The group walks toward the barracks.

                    JAMES
          Before the Red Army entered
          Majdanek, the Nazis had taken
          nearly all of the prisoners to
          camps in the West. In their haste,
          the SS didn't destroy the evidence.
                                                            77
                    JAMES (CONT'D)
          So, unlike other camps, Majdanek
          is... well preserved, for lack of a
          better phrase.

Benji and David look around, cowed by the enormity of the
place.

                    JAMES
          I might be a little sparser with my
          information overload today. But
          that doesn't mean I'm not more than
          eager to answer any questions you
          have. I think you'll find, for
          better or for worse, this place
          speaks for itself.

The group traverses the end less path along the identically
unnerving barracks.

The following scenes play out simply. We might notice that
Benji and David begin on opposite sides of the group but
gradually and unconsciously draw closer together as the tour
progresses.


INT. BARRACKS - DAY

The group approaches the exhibition barrack.

                    JAMES
          The barracks. Built to fit 250
          people. Often housed 500 and
          sometimes even beyond 1000.


LAT ER

James reads a passage from a survivor.


INT. UNDRESSING ROOM - DAY

The group stands in the bare windowless room.

                    JAMES
          The undressing room.


INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY

The group enters this dank, low ceiling room.

                    JAMES
          The shower room.
                                                           78

LATER

James reads another harrowing personal recount.


INT. GAS CHAMBER - DAY

The group inside this considerably darker room.

                    JAMES
          The gas chamber.

The group looks around silently, in various stages of nausea.

                    JAMES
          The blue stains on the walls are
          residue from Zyklon B.

Benji unconsciously puts his hand on David's shoulder.


INT. CREMATORIUM � DAY

The group looks at the crematorium, body sized ovens,
compl etely preserved. James doesn't say anything.


INT. SHOE DISPLAY BARRACK - DAY

In this barrack, there are a display of discarded victims'
shoes.

Benji and David are now standing next to each other.  They
stare at the mound of shoes together. It's overwhelming.


EXT. MAUSOLEUM - DAY

The group arrives at the enormous spaceship-like Mausoleum.

They stand under it, dwarfed by the structure.    We see them
fro m behind in a wide.


INT. VAN - DAY

The group rides back to the hotel.   They are all in various
stages of shell-shock.

As we move down the van, we see David sitting next to Benji.

Benji is staring out the window and openly crying.

David is heartbroken.
                                                        79

EXT. LUBLIN HOTEL - DAY

The group walks towards the entrance.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL - DAY

The group enters the lobby.

                    JAMES
          If we can gather up here for a
          minute?

The group gathers around James in the lobby.

                    JAMES
          How are we all feeling?

No one wants to respond.

                    MARCIA
          I feel nauseous.

                    DIANE
          Yeah, that sounds about right.

The group nods, understanding.   James notices Eloge:

                    JAMES
          Eloge, how are you doing? I know
          you don't have the same advantage
          of distance.

                    ELOGE
          I'm okay. I'm just glad I'm not
          completely inured to this kind of
          thing. I think that would be worse.

Marcia puts her hand on his shoulder.

                     JAMES
          Well, I'm comforted that we all
          shared that with each other. Now.
          To change gears for a moment: I
          don't want to rush anybody. But we
          are scheduled to leave quite soon
          for Zamosc. But also -- I wanted to
          sa y: we are losing our boys!

Benji and David nod.
                                                           80

                    JAMES
          That's right -- Benji and David are
          staying here for the night and
          finishing their pilgrimage to their
          grandmother's house tomorrow.

                    BENJI
          Yeah man, shit, I'm gonna miss all
          you guys. I feel like we're a
          weird little family.

                     DAVID
              (rote)
          Yeah me too, I feel that way too.
          Thanks so much everyone.

The group ad libs goodbyes to Benji and David.    David watches
as Marcia and Diane address Benji.

                     MARCIA
          Y ou're a very special person.

                    BENJI
          Shit, you too Marcia.

                    MARCIA
          Oh, god, no I'm not. Anyway, you
          have my information. Send me a
          picture from your grandma's house.
          I'm genuinely curious.

                    DIANE
          Take care of yourself, honey.

                    BENJI
          Thanks D. And you take care of
          this lug over here.

Benji taps Mark's gut.    Mark still hates him.

Marcia and Diane both say goodbye to David, but without any
fanfare or emotion.

As they do, David can only focus on Eloge speaking to Benji:

                    ELOGE
          You're like me, Benji.    You're a
          seeker.

                    BENJI
          You really think so?

                       ELOGE
          Yes, I do.
                                                             81

                    BENJI
          Yo, that means so much to me, man.
          I feel like you were some kind of
          brilliant sage in another life.

James approaches Benji, this is hard for him to say:

                    JAMES
          Benji, I wanna say, I've been doing
          these tours for five years and
          you're the first person that's
          given me any actionable feedback.

                    BENJI
          You serious, man?   What did I say?

                    JAMES
          What do you mean? You told me that
          we should be meeting peopl e,
          meeting local people, understanding
          local culture.

                     BENJI
               (no recollection of it)
          Oh, yeah! That would be awesome,
          man.

                    JAMES
          And I resisted in the moment but I
          haven't been able put it out of my
          mind. You lit a fire under me,
          Benji. Your honesty is so rare and
          so welcome.

                    BENJI
          Shut up, come here.

Benji hugs James, who's had his own private catharsis.

David watches them embrace:

With James' mop of h air buried in Benji's arms, it almost
looks like Benji is hugging David.

CUE: Chopin Nocturne Op. 9, No. 3


EXT. LUBLIN - AFTERNOON

The boys amble around Lublin. There's a nice thawing between
them.

They walk above the Czech�wka River mural, a parallel black
hole universe of the figures below.
                                                            82

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - AFTERNOON

At a makeshift bazaar, Benji tries on a funny Polish folk
hat. David snaps a picture of it.

Benji explains that's he's gonna buy the hat. David says,
"Why would you buy the hat? I just took the picture. Do you
really need to own that hat?"


MINUTES LATER

The boys leave the bazaar, Benji is wearing the hat.


EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING CITY - DUSK

The boys eat greasy shawarma and trudge up the hill.   The sun
is setting behind them.


EXT. BREWERY STREET - NIGHT

The boys walk under illuminated flowers and butterflies.

Benji jumps to try to swat a butterfly - he doesn't even come
close as David laughs.


EXT. LUBLIN STREET OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

The boys are on the outskirts of town, surrounded by some
taller buildings.

                    BENJI
          Check out this building.

                    DAVID
          Yeah?

                    BENJI
          It's pretty f uckin tall.

                    DAVID
          So?

                    BENJI
          I got one last joint.

                    DAVID
          How we gonna get up?

Benji nods over to the building as a SMOKER walks out and
lights up a cigarette.
                                                            83

INT. LUBLIN BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD leans against a desk. Pan off him to see
our smoker enter the building and, in tow, Benji and David,
like idiots trying to act casual.

They nod at the security guard who couldn't care less and
follow the smoker to the elevator bank.


INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Benji and David enter the elevator with the smoker and press
the top floor.

They all wait in the elevator in an awkward silence. Benji
looks like an idiot in his hat. The smoker casually starts a
chat:

                    SMOKER
          Cholera. Jutro ma pada.

                    BENJI
          Cool.


EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

A quiet rooftop overlooking Lublin. We slowly pan to see a
rusty, industrial door. We now push steadily toward the
door, which begins jiggling. Suddenly, it pops open and the
boys emerge-


EXT. ROOF � NIGHT

At the edge of the roof, the g uys pass a joint back and
forth. Benji's still in his Polish hat.

                    BENJI
          Yo, how you feeling, dude?

                    DAVID
          I feel good, man. I'm glad we went
          there today. Is that weird to say?

                    BENJI
          No, broheim, you're connecting to
          real shit. It's living. You need
          to do more of that.

David nods and takes another hit.    He notices something in
the distance.
                                                          84

                    DAVID
          Shit, you know what I think that
          is?

                       BENJI
          What?

                    DAVID
          Way down there: can you see it?

                     BENJI
              (squinting)
          Oh, shit--

                    DAVID
          Yeah. It's the camp.

Now we see it too. Over the boys' shoulders, in the distance,
is the Majdanek concentration camp.

                    DAVID
          It really is so close.    You can see
          the guard towers.

The guys, stoned, just stare at the camp from the perch above
the city.

                    BENJI
          Fuckin creepy.

                    DAVID
          Fuckin creepy .

There's a calm pause.    David still has the joint.

                    DAVID
          So what are you thinking about
          doing when you get back to
          Binghamton?

                    BENJI
          What do you mean?

                    DAVID
          I mean, like, what's your plan?

Benji pauses, uncomfortable.   He notices David has the joint.

                    BENJI
          Yo, dude, gimme that if you're just
          gonna stare at it.

                       DAVID
          Oh, sorry.
                                                85

                    BENJI
          It's my last one.

                    DAVID
          Sorry about that.

Benji takes a long drag.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, so, like, when I get back,
          it's gonna be pretty busy.

                     DAVID
          Oh yeah?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, my buddy Tim is reroofing his
          house and I'm probably gonna help
          out with that. He's got like a
          shit ton of adobe but he has no
          idea what the fuck he's doing.

                     DAVID
              (laughing)
          Seriously?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, but it's gonna be sweet when
          it's finished, you kn ow? It keeps
          moisture out better than the
          plastic, toxic shit they put on
          bullshit suburban houses--

                    DAVID
          That's awesome, man.

                     BENJI
          Yeah.   It's pretty rad.

They smoke.

                    DAVID
          But that's like, Tim's house?

                     BENJI
          What?

                    DAVID
          I mean, you're working on Tim's
          house.

                     BENJI
          So?
                                                            86

                    DAVID
          So, I mean, what are you gonna do?

                    BENJI
          I don't know man. Why are you
          asking me this shit?

                    DAVID
          Oh, sorry. I just wanted to make
          sure you're good and that you have
          a plan. I think I'm just a little
          stoned, sorry.

                    BENJI
          That's all right.

They settle.   Benji stews, something not sitting right--

                    BENJI
          So what are you gonna do when you
          get back?

                    DAVID
          Uh, go back to my job?   And my
          family? The usual ?

                    BENJI
          Cool, so I'll look forward to
          speaking to you in six months.

                    DAVID
          What does that mean?

                    BENJI
          You know what it means, man.

                     DAVID
          Do I?

                    BENJI
          Yo, I don't wanna start anything.

                     DAVID
          Cool.   Then don't.

Benji can't hold it in anymore - he turns to David:

                    BENJI
          You used to be like, different, you
          know? You used to be so emotional.
          You used to cry about everything.
                                                87

                    DAVID
          Yeah, I know. It was awful. Who the
          fuck wants to cry about everything?

Benji finally turns to him-

                    BENJI
          Dave! You're not listening to me.
          We used to be... man, we used to
          be...

                    DAVID
          Benji, I have a son and a wife and
          a job. I can't just, like, hang out
          with you all night, every night.

                    BENJI
          I don't want that.

                    DAVID
          Yes you do. You're like an all
          encompassing person, I don't think
          you realize--

                    BENJ I
          But you, like, literally never
          visit me.

                    DAVID
          You mean in Binghamton?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, that's where I live.

                    DAVID
          Well, I'm busy. And I live in New
          York City. Isn't it easier for you
          to come down to me?

                    BENJI
          It's the same fuckin distance,
          Dave.

                    DAVID
          Yeah, but it's New York City, it's
          the more logical place to visit
          than fucking Binghamton, all due
          respect.

                    BENJI
          What's wrong with Binghamton?
                                      88

          DAVID
Nothing's wrong with Binghamton.
You're just purposely making me
look like an asshole for
questioning it.

          BENJI
    (Under his breath)
Yo, fuck off.

          DAVID
Yo, you fuck off.

          BENJI
Why don't you care about me
anymore?

          DAVID
What does that mean? I do fucking
care about you!

          BENJI
I never hear from you anymore.

          DAVID
I'm standing three inches from you!
We're sharing the same fucking
joint in Poland!

           BENJI
Yeah, bu t you only came here with
me because I tried to kill myself.

          DAVID
No I didn't.

          BENJI
Yes you did.

          DAVID
Benji. Don't say that.

          BENJI
You did, Dave!

          DAVID
Yeah, well it scared the shit out
of me! I walk around with this
terrible image of you in my head
and, yeah, I don't want to fucking
lose you, okay!? In my mind, you
are like a thousand feet tall and
constantly sawing off your own
legs.
                                                          89
                    DAVID (CONT'D)
          And I put in so much effort -- so
          much fucking effort - to just be
          base level normal. To just hold
          down a normal job selling "ad
          banners to the internet", to have a
          stable marriage with someone who's
          a hundred times better looking than
          me, to raise one child in the most
          expensive city on earth. It all
          feels like 24 hours of panic to
          just have a base level of normalcy,
          to just show up, to get to z ero,
          and I look at you and it scrambles
          everything that makes any sense-

                       BENJI
          Yo, dude--

                    DAVID
          Don't call me fucking "dude"!
          Don't call me that right now!   I
          mean: look at where we are!

There's a silence. It's very tense.    Benji is shocked by his
David's sudden surge of anger.

David calms down.   He speaks quietly and with emotion:

                    DAVID
          I don't understand why you would
          ever do anything so fucking stupi d
          to yourself...
              (chokes back tears)
          If I had your mind... Benji, if I
          had your mind...

                       BENJI
          What?

                     DAVID
          If I had your mind, I'd be fucking
          president.

                       BENJI
          Dave...

                    DAVID
          Do you see how people love you? Do
          you see what happens when you walk
          into a room?

Benji's got tears in his eyes.
                                                            90

                    DAVID
          I would give anything to know what
          that feels like. To know what it
          feels like to have charm. To feel
          easy. To feel fun. To light up a
          fucking room when I walk in.

Benji nods, trying not to cry.

                    DAVID
          But you light up a room and then
          you shit on everything inside of
          it.

In slow motion, following the boys as they make their way
back to their room.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The boys enter their hotel room silently.


LATER

David is lying on his bed, reading on his phone.    Benji
emerges from the bathroom, having showered.

The mood is bleak.

                    BENJI
          You can go.

                     DAVID
          Thanks.

David grabs his shit and walks into the bathroom.   The shower
turns on.


LATER

The boys are asleep in their separate beds.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL ROOM � MORNING

The next morning, David and Benji are packing up their stuff.
They don't speak to each other.
                                                            91

INT. LOBBY DINING AREA - DAY

The boys silently eat their complimentary breakfast in the
hotel dining area.

David's phone buzzes.     He checks it.

                    DAVID
          Taxi's here.


INT. LUBLIN HOTEL - DAY

Through the window of the lobby, we see David and Benji load
their bags into the trunk of an old, colorful taxi.


EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The taxi passes through the countryside, passing a little
road marker for Krasnystaw.


INT. TAXI - DAY

The boys are in the back of the taxi on the way to their
grandma's town.


EXT. KRASNYSTAW TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The taxi pulls up to the town square. It's got a quiet mid-
day feeling. Shops line the square along with simple, three
story apartment buildings. The guys step out of the taxi and
get their bags from the trunk.


EXT. TOWN SQUARE � DAY

The boys, holding their luggage, traverse the town square.

                    BENJI
          Do you see a 25 anywhere?

                     DAVID
          I don't see any numbers anywhere.
               (off his phone)
          I think it might be around this
          way:
                                                         92

EXT. SIDE STREET NEAR CHURCH - DAY

David leads Benji around the corner, passing the St. Francis
Xavier Church, which has a massive wooden cross erected in
the parking lot.

David directs them toward an alley.


EXT. ALLEY IN FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

They approach a little alley that looks like it hasn't
changed in a hundred years.

                    DAVID
          I guess that's it-

David points to a little address above a door - 25.

                    DAVID
          Is that possible?

                    BENJI
          It's so... unremarkable.

                    DAVID
          Yeah. I don't know what I pictured.

                    BENJI
          Me neither.

They are trying to have a feeling about the place but it's
not coming.

                    BENJI
          You know, she slapped me once.

                    DAVID
          What?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, grandma slapped me.

                    DAVID
          Shit, really?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, I was late to meet her for
          dinner. Just like 15 minutes. And
          also I was pretty high. It was at
          the Hudson restaurant. On third
          Ave. In the purgatory of Murray
          Hill.
                                                         93

                    DAVID
          Right, I know it.   Did it hurt?

                    BENJI
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          Wow.

                    BENJI
          But it was the best thing that ever
          happened to me. I was literally
          elated for a full 24 hours after
          that.

                    DAVID
          Why?

                    BENJI
          I don't know. I mean, it was at
          this fuckin restaurant she went to
          every week, everyone knew her
          there, she dressed up mad formal
          for it like it was a big occasion.
          And, I don't know, the fact that
          she cared about me more than
          looking good for the restaurant. I
          don't know. It made me happy.

David looks at his cousin and then plops his suitcase down.

                    DAVID
          I got an idea.

                    BENJI
          What?

                    DAVID
          Let's put a stone on the stoop.

                    BENJI
          What do you mean?

                    DAVID
          I mean let's get a little stone and
          put it on her stoop. To say we were
          here. That she's not forgotten.

                    BENJI
          She's not buried here.
                                                           94

                    DAVID
          So what? This is the last place
          she was in Poland. The last place
          any of us were.

Benji is touched. They put their bags down and look for a
stone on the ground.

                    BENJI
          I found two. Here you go, man.

                    DAVID
          Thanks.

The boys approach the apartment and put their stones on the
front stoop, in front of the door.

They step back and look at what they've done.   There's a nice
feeling.

After a moment, they hear an older man calling out at them in
Polish.

                    BENJI
          Yo, I think he's yelling at us.

The boys look back: on the balcony across the alley, the
OLDER MAN is berating them in Polish.

David tries to reason with him.

                    DAVID
          Hi. Sorry, sir. Americans.
          Americans. English.

The man gestures for them to wait and walks into his
apartment.

                    BENJI
          What the fuck was that about?

After a moment, the man emerges with his 20-year-old SON. He
points at the boys and then talks to his son in Polish. The
son nods.

                    SON
          Hi, you speak English?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, what's the problem?
                                                        95

                    SON
          Oh, yes, hello. My father said
          that you placed rocks on the stoop
          of the apartment.

                    BENJI
          Yeah, we did. Our grandmother used
          to live here. And she died.

                     SON
          Oh.   I'm sorry for your loss.

                    BENJI
          Thanks, man.

Pause.

                    SON
          So why did you put the rocks in
          front of the door?

                    DAVID
          Oh - it's a Jewish tradition. When
          you visit someone's grave, you're
          supposed to place a stone on it. To
          signify that you were ther e.

                    SON
          Yes, but she is not buried under
          the door. Right?

                    DAVID
          No she's not. It's more of a
          sentimental thing. Like a gesture.

                    SON
          Oh, I see. Sentimental. I
          understand. This is very sweet, I
          think.

                     DAVID
          Thanks.

The son explains all of this to the father in Polish. Benji
and David watch as the father talks for a long time to the
son. The son finally nods.

                     SON
          Yes, I'm sorry. I understand your
          situati on. But my father says that
          is a hazard to leave the stones.
          An older woman lives there now.
          She could trip.
                                                            96

David and Benji nod, a weird feeling of resignation.  They
calmly walk to the stoop and remove the rocks. Not knowing
what to do with it, David puts it in his pocket.

Benji puts his rock in his pocket too.

It's bittersweet.

                    DAVID
          Hey, I was thinking: why don't we
          grab a cab back to the city and you
          could come over for dinner?

                     BENJI
          Yeah?

                    DAVID
          Yeah, definitely. I know Priya
          would want to see you and Abe would
          love to tell you every fact about
          the Empire State building.

Benji laughs.

                    BENJI
          That's tempting.

                     DAVID
          Come on.

Benji looks around, considering.

                    BENJI
          Eh, that's okay, man.

                     DAVID
          Really?

                     BENJI
          Yeah.

                    DAVID
          Okay. Well let's at le ast split a
          cab back to the city and I could
          drop you at Penn Station for your
          train upstate.

Benji thinks about it.

                     BENJI
          You know, Dave? I think I'm
          probably just gonna hang out here
          for a bit.

                    DAVID
          At the airport?

                    BENJI
          Yeah. I kinda like it here. You
          meet the craziest people.
                                                         98

                    DAVID
          Are you serious?

                     BENJI
          Yeah.

David looks at his cousin in the eyes... And then slaps him
right in the face.

                     BENJI
          Ow!   Jesus, what the fuck man!

                     DAVID
          Oh!   Shit, sorry!

                    BENJI
          Why the fuck did you do that?

                    DAVID
          Cause grandma! The restaurant!
          You said it was the best thing that
          ever happened to you.

                    BENJI
          That was different!   I was 18!   I
          needed direction!

                    DAVID
          Oh- Sorry, Benji!

                    BENJI
          Jesus! I can't feel my ear.

                    DAVID
          I'm so sorry, man.    I'm so sorry.

Benji rubs the side of his face.

                    DAVID
          She really loved you.

                    BENJI
          She loved you too, Dave. She just
          knew I needed a little more. You
          were fuckin set and everyone knew
          that.

                     DAVID
          Really?

                    BENJI
          Yeah, man. You're Golden, Ponyboy.
                                                               99

                       DAVID
          I am?

                    BENJI
          You know that. Come here.

David is overwhelmed. It's just what he needed to hear.

Benji pulls David into a hug. And whispers in his ear.

                    BENJI
          I'm gonna be fine, man. Okay?

                       DAVID
          You sure?

Benji pulls back and nods.     David can't take it.

                    BENJI
          I'll see you around cuz.

David brings Benji in for another hug. David has tears in his
eyes but he holds it together.

INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

Back at the airport, in a repeat of our opening shot, we are
slowly zooming in on a crowd of travelers as the music rises.

As we zoom in, we notice that Benji is sitting alone on the
airport bench where we first met him.

He's looking around, watching the strangers go by.

Anyone can be a friend.

We zoom closer and closer until his sweet face fills the
frame.
