SEQ.0050 - PROLOGUE


EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A heavily armored VAN tears through the night at top speed.


INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Inside the van, T.C.R.I. (Techno-Cosmic Research Institute)
SOLDIERS armed with FUTURISTIC SWAT WEAPONS sit at anxious
attention, sweat glistening on their faces.

Their leader, SPIDER, a super-yoked military commando with a
Steven Segal ponytail locks and loads his rifle.

                    SPIDER
          Listen up! We're going after Dr.
          Baxter Stockman. He was TCRI's lead
          genetic scientist, but he went
          rogue, stole billions of dollars
          worth of research and created an
          ACTUAL MUTANT. He's holed up in a
          makeshift lab of an abandoned
          building.

The SWAT guys look at each other nervously.

                     SPIDER (CONT'D)
          Each of you has been issued a high
          powered, anti-mutant-neutralizer.
          Whatever Stockman's made, this can
          unmake it.

Spider pats his rifle.

                    SPIDER (CONT'D)
          Cynthia Utrom herself will be
          quarterbacking from HQ. Anything to
          add Cynthia?

Spider gestures to a monitor with a live video feed to
CYNTHIA UTROM. Cold, menacing and German.

                    CYNTHIA UTROM
          This mission is of the utmost
          importance. Failure will be...
          frowned upon. Bring me Stockman's
          mutant... and whatever he used to
          make it.

The SWAT guys look at each other: was that supposed to be
reassuring?
                                                         2.


                    SPIDER
          You heard her, boys, lock and load.


INT. STOCKMAN'S SECRET LAB - LATER

In the basement of an abandoned building, where exposed pipes
drip, drip, drip water down into fetid puddles, DR. BAXTER
STOCKMAN, a brilliant, disheveled scientist works feverishly.

He mixes various chemicals into a vial of GREEN MUTANT OOZE.

                     BAXTER STOCKMAN
          I've done it, Little One! I've
          perfected the ooze! Are you excited
          for Daddy?

We pan down to see that Stockman has an ANTHROPOMORPHIC FLY-
BABY. The Fly-Baby sits in an old pack `n' play, eating from
a cafeteria-size bag of Domino sugar and buzzing happily.

                    BAXTER STOCKMAN (CONT'D)
          My "friends" at T.C.R.I. want to
          use you as a weapon! I couldn't
          allow that. But we're safe now.
          Soon, I'll make you brothers and
          sisters. A real family for both of
          us.

We see pictures of various mutant schematics - a warthog,
stingray, etc. There's little GREEN VIALS with newly-created
baby mutants floating in them.

                    BAXTER STOCKMAN (CONT'D)
          I never had a family, little one...
          nobody liked me. I always felt a
          greater connection to the animals I
          experimented on than PEOPLE... So
          with you and your siblings... I'm
          creating a family... I think we can
          finally be happy...

Outside, there's a loud BANG! Stockman looks up, terrified.


EXT. STOCKMAN'S SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS

                    SPIDER
          Again!

The SWAT team slams a BATTERING RAM, breaking the door down.

                    SPIDER (CONT'D)
          Go, go, go!
                                                         3.


The SWAT guys rush into the building.


INT. STOCKMAN'S SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS

We follow the SWAT team through the abandoned basement into
the lab, where they find Stockman frantically trying to pack
up his equipment. He holds the vial of ooze.

                    SPIDER
          Freeze! Don't move! Where is the
          specimen?

                    BAXTER STOCKMAN
          I...I...uh...

The SWAT team finds the Fly-Baby's crib empty.

                    GUARD
          It's not here.

                    BAXTER
          Wait wait be careful-

Spider covers his mouth.

                    SPIDER
          (to Stockman) Stay quiet.

A shriek and then the SWAT guys start getting taken down one
by one by Fly-Baby.

                    SPIDER (CONT'D)
          Cease fire! We need them alive! (to
          Stockman) Don't move.

Fly-Baby lunges onto Spider's face and RIPS his eyeball from
its socket! He SCREAMS in agony and fires at Fly-Baby.

                    BAXTER STOCKMAN
          No! No! Don't shoot! The chemicals
          are highly volatile!

But it's too late. Spider shoots and the chemicals EXPLODE.

                    BAXTER STOCKMAN (CONT'D)
          No!

Baxter leaps toward the Fly-Baby, shielding it with his body
but taking the FULL FORCE OF THE BLAST. Both Baxter and Fly-
Baby are ENVELOPED IN FLAMES.

When the flames clear, Baxter's fatally wounded body lies on
the floor, still gripping the VIAL OF OOZE.
                                                            4.


The Fly-Baby is nowhere to be seen, seemingly INCINERATED.
Spider dusts himself off and looks at his fallen team. He
gets a call from UTROM.

                    SPIDER
          Cynthia, I'm sorry. We lost
          everything.


INT. TCRI - CONTINUOUS

A frustrated Cynthia sits in a giWhy they're gonna milk ant
room, surrounded by huge pieces of machinery and vats of
chemicals.

                    CYNTHIA UTROM
          Bring me anything you can find. We
          will replicate his research, no
          matter how long it takes. Baxter
          Stockman's creations MUST live on!
          And with it a new form of life
          itself.


INT. STOCKMAN'S SECRET LAB

The SWAT guys grab what's left of Stockman's work. As they
remove his body, they don't see the dying Stockman release
his grip on the vial of ooze as he fades into the infinite.

The ooze ROLLS INTO A NEARBY SEWER GRATE, slipping into the
inky abyss, a wheel set in motion...

CHYRON: 15 Years Later



SEQ.0100 - Meet the Turtles


INT. SEWERS - NIGHT

QUICK SHOTS of the turtles SUITING UP FOR BATTLE. Swords?
SHEATHED. Sais? GRIPPED. Bo? SPUN LIKE HELICOPTER.

The Turtles run out in formation, looking legit cool (perhaps
echoing the 80s opening). They sprint through a sewer pipe
overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge- they LEAP INTO THE NIGHT!
                                                           5.


EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Leo stands before his brothers on a shadowy rooftop. He pulls
out an ANCIENT LOOKING SCROLL.

                    LEONARDO
          Master Splinter has given us a very
          important mission for tonight. The
          target is across the street. We
          must use stealth and cunning to
          infiltrate the human world and
          retrieve... Go-Gurt!!!

          DONATELLO                           RAPHAEL
(making fun of his voice)          (mocking leo)
Go-gurt!!! We're going to the      Go-gurt!!! Why do you sound
bodega to get go-gurt!!!           like that?

                    MICHELANGELO
          Okay Batman.

                    LEONARDO
          Dude, what? I'm just trying to hype
          you guys up!

Raph grabs the list.

                    RAPHAEL
          Gimme that list, what else we
          gettin?
              (reading)
          Four quarts of non-fat milk, ice
          cream, fruits and veggies...

                       MICHELANGELO
          Gross.

                    RAPHAEL
          -and a party-size bag of Cool Ranch
          Doritos.

                    MICHELANGELO
          I like cheese puffs.

                    DONATELLO
          He was VERY specific about party
          size. He underlined it twice!

                    LEONARDO
          Alright - Donnie, you're on
          toiletries.

                       DONATELLO
          Got it.
                                       6.


          LEONARDO
Raph, you're stocking up the pantry-

          RAPHAEL
[sighs]

          LEONARDO
- and Mikey, you're on junk food.

          MICHAELANGELO
Yes sirsky!

          LEONARDO
And remember, don't let any humans
see you! Because why???

          ALL TURTLES
Humans are the demon scum of the
earth, avoid them, don't say "hi."
They lust to murder that which is
different from them. To interact
with them, is to die.

           LEONARDO
And hey I know that's objectively
prejudice but that's what dad
taught us.

          MICHELANGELO
Uh, I think humans seem kinda cool
to be honest... Beyonce...

          RAPHAEL
Drake! That guy's the goat of all
time!

          DONATELLO
We wouldn't have K-pop without
humans, so...

          LEONARDO
I would LOVE to have a champagne
brunch with Tom Brady-

          MICHELANGELO
Guy Fieri seems like a fun hang!
And I've always wanted to go to
Flavortown!

          LEONARDO
Look we all think humans are
cool...But we got a job to do.
    (deep voice)
Let's go.
                                                         7.


         MICHELANGELO                     DONATELLO
(mocking)                       Ooo I'm the leader...
                                                                *
Let's go! I'm Leo.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          You sound like you have bronchitis!


MONTAGE AROUND NEW YORK

-Leo covers a security camera inside a bodega. Raph repels
down from the ceiling and grabs two loaves of bread. Donnie
grabs some toilet paper with his bo-staff.

-At the docks, Raph leaps onto a shipping container. He grabs
a jug of PROTEIN POWDER.

-Leo and Mikey LEAP onto a moving truck and break inside to
reveal bags of Party Size Doritos.


EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

The Turtles ascend the side of a building that has a GIANT
screen on it. We see a NEWS REPORT playing on the screen...

                    TV ANCHOR (ON SCREEN)
          Terror strikes the heart of
          Manhattan yet again today with
          another brazen and DEADLY heist! An
          industrial grade power converter
          was stolen mid-transport! Police
          fear it's connected with a recent
          string of other deadly thefts! New
          Yorkers live in fear! Parents
          citywide are calling for a curfew
          until the criminal is caught, but
          the only lead is a mysterious
          mastermind known on the streets
          as... Superfly.


EXT. ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

Leonardo leaps onto a roof, followed by the others.

                    LEONARDO
          Not bad! Heading home on a good
          note. Let's get these groceries
          back-
                                                         8.


                    RAPHAEL
          Woah woah, what? We've only been
          out for an hour, come on let's stay
          out!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yeah! Come on!

                    LEONARDO
          Guys come on we said we weren't
          gonna do this anymore! Last week
          was Madison Square Garden to watch
          the Knicks, the week before that
          was the Adele concert.

                    MICHELANGELO
          She hit them notes like crazy!

          DONATELLO                        RAPHAEL
My spirit left my body.         It was transcendent!!

                    LEONARDO
          Splinter's gonna catch on, we're
          gonna get grounded.

                    DONATELLO
          He's a shut in. He doesn't know how
          long it takes to do things. For all
          he knows it takes three hours to
          get to the bodega.

                    LEONARDO
          No guys, we told him we wouldn't
          mess around anymore, alright?

                    DONATELLO
              (looking at his phone)
          Oh hey! There's an outdoor movie
          night in Brooklyn!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I hope it's a funny one!

           RAPHAEL                        DONATELLO
                                                               *
Yeah!!! Hope it's violent!      You need to chill out, Raph.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          Stop moping Leo, let's go!

The three brothers leap off the roof. Leo watches them, and
then reluctantly follows.

                    LEONARDO
          Fine! Wait up!!
                                                            9.


SEQ.0200 - OUTDOOR MOVIE


EXT. DUMBO ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Ferris Bueller's Day Off plays on an outdoor screen. The
Turtles watch from a nearby roof. They are all entranced.

                     MICHELANGELO
          Oh snap!

                    RAPHAEL
          Oh wow that vest is a choice, huh?

                    MICHELANGELO
          I wish I had hair like that.

                    DONATELLO
          I wish I had hair, period!

                    MICHELANGELO
          We did go bald at a young age.

                    LEONARDO
          Is this high school like in real
          life?

                    RAPHAEL
          Yeah, you go to high school you can
          just hijack a parade whenever you
          want.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yeah, can you imagine that?

                    DONATELLO
          Yeah I'm totally not jealous at
          all.

The turtles look DOWN AT THE CROWD of TEENS, hanging out...

A guy puts his arm around a girl. Leo clocks this, jealous.
Some jocks stand around downing beers.

                    RAPHAEL
          Maybe one day everyone will love us
          like everyone loves Ferris Bueller.

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah, yeah you know, maybe one day.
          (clears his throat) Let's get home,
          guys.
                                                           10.


They take one more look at the people having fun at the
screening before they descend into the sewer.

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Guys, let's go.

They sneak past a group of TEENS on the subway platform.

                    TEEN
          I love being young and free to go
          places!

Mikey looks wistfully through a sewer grate out at the city.


SEQ.0300 - SPLINTER'S FLASHBACK


INT. SEWER HOME - LATER

The Turtles sneak back into their living room.

                    LEONARDO
          Everybody be quiet!

                    MICHELANGELO
          You be quiet!

                    LEONARDO
          I'm literally whispering!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Make white noises.

                    DONATELLO
          Mikey stop!

                    LEONARDO
          Dude that makes it louder...

CLICK! A LAMP turns on. SPLINTER is waiting.

                      ALL TURTLES
          Ah!

                    SPLINTER
          Boys! Where have you been? I've
          been FREAKING out!

They all talk at once.

           LEONARDO                          MICHELANGELO
We're sorry Dad...                  There was this cat and you
                                    know I'm scared of cats...
                                                          11.


                      DONATELLO
          There was a lot of traffic on the...
          sidewalk...

                    SPLINTER
          Wait a second... you said you would
          go shopping and come right back.
          Where were you?

The turtles stammer, searching for an excuse.

                    LEONARDO
          Look, we're really sorry, Splinter.
          Some of the guys wanted to see a
          movie, and I tried to talk them out
          of it.

                    RAPHAEL, DONATELLO AND MICHELANGLEO
          LEO!!!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Are you serious?!

                    SPLINTER
          What?! You WATCHED a movie?! With
          HUMANS?

                    MICHELANGELO
          You ratted us out!

                    SPLINTER
          Hey! DON'T use that word that way!

                    LEONARDO
          I mean it's 2023 Mikey...

                    MICHELANGELO
          Sorry, Dad.

                    DONATELLO
          It wasn't that big a deal! We just
          watched a movie and came back.
          We're fine!

                    SPLINTER
          (grumble) You forgot, huh? You
          don't remember why humans are
          disgusting monsters? Why they're
          dangerous? Why they're gonna milk
          us for our blood?
                                                        12.



                   MICHELANGELO                     DONATELLO
          They don't want to milk us      Again with the milking...
          dad.

                    RAPHAEL
          We don't even have nipples!

                    SPLINTER
          You know what? I'm gonna tell the
          story again.

                    TURTLES
          No!/Dad we hate the story!/It's
          such a bummer!/I get a year older
          every time!/Please please please
          no!/No no no!

                    SPLINTER
          Just for that, I tell you the LONG
          version. Hehehe!


SEQ.0305 - RAT SPLINTER


EXT. NEW YORK CITY SIDEWALK - DAY - FLASHBACK

SPLINTER, a ragged NYC rat, rummages through trash.

                     SPLINTER (V.O)
          It all start fifteen years ago. I
          was a young rat in my twenties.
          Look at me, I was so cute. I was on
          top of the world.
              (beat)
          No I was the BOTTOM of world! It
          was terrible! Nobody liked me, I
          had no friends! Raccoons didn't
          like me. Dogs did not like me. You
          know who hated me the most? Humans!
          I had one friend, he was a
          cockroach, we got along very well.
          His name was Kevin...
              (he's stepped on)
          And then, I ate him!

Splinter (the rat) climbs through the sewer grate...


INT. SEWER - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

... And finds the baby turtles covered in a mysterious ooze.
                                                           13.


                    SPLINTER (V.O.)
          One day, everything changed.

One of them approaches and nuzzles up against Splinter.

                    SPLINTER (V.O.)
          You were the first things I met
          that didn't want to kill me or eat
          me. I could't just leave you there.
          You were covered in this ooze that
          someone had dumped in the sewers.
          Whatever this ooze was, it
          transformed us.

Splinter and the Turtles MORPH INTO MUTANTS.

                    SPLINTER (V.O.)
          Because I was older, I became older
          rat man. You guys were babies so
          you stayed baby turtle creatures.
          If you think about that, it
          couldn't make more sense.

The baby turtles run and climb around the sewer.

                    SPLINTER
          It was weird, but, we became a
          family.

SEQ.0310 - Weird Family

SWEET FAMILY BEATS:

- They dance to a record.

- The baby turtles' stomachs rumble. They need food!

- Splinter feeds pizza to the baby turtles; they like it!

- Splinter mops up the sewer. The baby turtles draw on the
walls and each other, making a mess.

- Splinter bathes them and puts them to bed.

-After going to bed, the turtles crawl in with Splinter,
sprawled out on top of and beside him.

-While running through the sewer, the turtles notice colorful
lights from the surface. They motion to Splinter, wanting to
venture outside...
                                                        14.


                    SPLINTER (V.O.)
          You were obsessed with the human
          world. So I decided to give it a
          shot.


SEQ.0315 - TIMES SQUARE


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Splinter and the turtles emerge in the heart of Times Square.
They take in the massive buildings and colorful
advertisements.

                    BABY TURTLES
          Woah!!!

People walk by, blissfully unaware of them.

                    BABY TURTLES (CONT'D)
          Woww!!

Then... the humans notice Splinter, the rat man.

                    WOMAN
          Oh I'm sorry, excuse me...

                    SPLINTER (V.O.)
          It didn't go well.

                    WOMAN
          Oh my god it's a rat man!

                    HUMANS
          A rat man?!/Everybody look at the
          rat man!

                    MAN IN TIMES SQUARE
          It's not a rat man, it's just a bad
          Mickey Mouse costume!
              (guy goes in for a selfie)
          It's real! I touched it! I touched
          it!

                    HUMANS
          Mutant rat!/Kill the rat man!

HUMANS ATTACK SPLINTER throwing bottles and trash at him.

Splinter loses grip of the Turtles and everything goes SLO-
MO: They scatter in every direction, out of Splinter's reach.
                                                         15.


                    SPLINTER
          Boys!! Mikey!

Splinter scoops up one, two, three turtles. He spots Mikey,
headed towards a bustling intersection.

Splinter charges through the crowd, shedding humans like a
wide receiver, catching Mikey just before he's hit by a
truck.

He cradles his babies, who smile up at him, oblivious.

                    HUMAN
          Look there he is!

                     HUMAN 2
          That's not a cat, it's actually a
          rat! Get him before he goes back in
          the sewer!

Splinter disappears into a manhole, with turtles held close.


SEQ.0320 - NINJUTSU


INT. SEWER - BACK TO SCENE

                    SPLINTER
          That day I promised to never let
          you get hurt EVER again. I needed
          to find a way to unlock ancient
          secrets of Ninjutsu. How to turn a
          body into a weapon of DEATH! And...
          I found it.


INT. SEWER HOME - VARIOUS - FLASHBACK

Splinter watches martial arts YOUTUBE VIDEOS.

Splinter and the Turtles train, having fun.

As the years pass, the Turtles and their ninja skills grow.

                                                           16.


INT. SEWER HOME - PRESENT

Splinter finishes the story, the Turtles rapt with attention.

                    SPLINTER
          We thought we needed the human
          world, but we only need each other.
          That's why I'm so strict! Ya know!?
          You boys are all I got. And you are
          all I'll ever have!

                    MICHELANGELO
          You don't know that.

                    SPLINTER
          I do! You know other mutants my
          age? It's a really small pool.
          There's no apps to meet other
          mutant ladies! Trust me! I check
          everyday!

The Turtles look away, not so sure how lucky they are.

                    SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          Look, I really don't want to do
          this. No leaving the sewer for one
          month.

                       MICHELANGELO
          Seriously?

                       DONATELLO
          What?

                    SPLINTER
          Yeah yeah yeah yeah, I made up my
          mind. That's it, I'm done.

This hits Raph hard. He storms off- pissed.

                    RAPHAEL
          This sucks.

                    LEONARDO
          Raph, come on.

                    RAPHAEL
          Shut up Leo!

Raph pushes him off. Donnie and Mikey sadly follow Raph.

                       LEONARDO
          Mikey?
                                                17.


                    DONATELLO
          Was it worth it Mr. Leader?

Splinter looks away sadly.


INT. THE SEWERS - THE TURTLES' ROOM - LATER

The four Turtles lay in their beds.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Hey guys, if we weren't monsters
          that were shunned by society and we
          could actually do what we wanted...
          what would you guys do?

                    DONATELLO
          I mean... If I'm being honest...
          I'd just be normal. You know?

                    RAPHAEL
          Yeah... like go to high school...

                    LEONARDO
          Maybe... get a girlfriend. Go to
          prom?

                    DONATELLO
          With your rizz? Not likely.

                    RAPHAEL
          I just gotta get out of this sewer
          man! I like you guys and all, but I
          simply cannot live a happy life
          knowing that your faces are the
          last things I'm gonna see before I
          die!

                    LEONARDO
          Well guess what guys... it's never
          gonna happen. So let's just stop
          talking about it, alright?

They roll over to go to sleep.




SEQ.0360 - ICE CREAM TRUCK HEIST
                                                         18.


EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

WE SEE a THUG in an ICE CREAM TRUCK parked on the street.

                    ICE CREAM THUG
          Alright focus up... the truck
          containing the radioactive storage
          unit is one minute out.

We see two more THUGS up the block. They're dressed as
construction workers.

                       CONSTRUCTION THUG 1
          Copy that.

                    ICE CREAM THUG
          Let's not mess this up guys.
          Superfly doesn't take kindly to
          errors.

                    CONSTRUCION THUG 2
          Any idea what he's building with
          all this weird equipment?

                    CONSTRUCTION THUG 1
          Who cares? Hey as long as the check
          clears, am I right?

                    CONSTRUCTION THUG 2
          Target's approaching.

We see an ARMORED TRUCK approaching. The construction THUGS
throw TIRE POPPING TRACKS across the road!

                       ARMORED TRUCK DRIVER
          Ahhh!

The truck ROLLS OVER THEM - and CRASHES!

                    ICE CREAM THUG
          Sixty seconds till police response.

The ICE CREAM TRUCK backs up to the back of the armored car
as the two construction guys put EXPLOSIVES on the hinges of
the door. They BLOW it off and carry the Device into the Ice
Cream Truck! It's pretty SEAMLESS!

                    ICE CREAM THUG (CONT'D)
          30 seconds we gotta move!

Everyone PILES in the ICE CREAM TRUCK and they PEEL OFF!!
                                                           19.


INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The thugs are CELEBRATING as they SPEED away from the scene.

                    CONSTRUCTION THUG 1
          Woo!

                    CONSTRUCTION THUG 2
          Yeah!

                    ICE CREAM THUG
          Hey let's not get carried away.
          Hey, hey everybody keep your cool!

A COP CAR turns its lights and siren on and chases after
them.

                    ICE CREAM THUG (CONT'D)
          Cops!

They SPEED AWAY, making some CRAZY TURNS, the cops hot on
their tail! They reach a roadblock with more cops waiting for
them.

                    ICE CREAM THUG (CONT'D)
          Guys there's no way out of this,
          what're we gonna do?

                    CONSTRUCTION THUG 1
          Superfly's gonna kill us!

The COP SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM-

                    COP
          In pursuit of suspects moving south
          on Broadway.

-when suddenly - the WHOLE ICE CREAM TRUCK is LIFTED off the
ground and into the sky!

                    COP 2
          Whoa whoa-what?!?

                    THUGS
          AAAHHHHHH!!

The truck flies through the city, weaving between
skyscrapers.


EXT. STATEN ISLAND BOAT GRAVEYARD - MOMENTS LATER

The Ice Cream Truck is DROPPED onto a decrepit freighter. The
THUGS recover, disoriented.
                                                          20.


                      ICE CREAM THUG
            Oh man what is this place?

The back door is TORN open and we see the thugs RECOIL in
FEAR.

                      ICE CREAM THUG (CONT'D)
            Dear god. Is that...?

                      CONSTRUCTION THUG 1
            That's...he's...he's...

                      CONSTRUCTION THUG 2
            You really are...

                        SUPERFLY
            Superfly.

Cut wide as the thugs SCREAM in terror and the truck rocks
back and forth.

Superfly's machine parallaxes into frame. It reads "TCRI."


SEQ.0361 - CYNTHIA ON THE CASE


INT. T.C.R.I. - LAB - EVENING

WE SEE   MUTANT GENETIC BLUEPRINTS on old CHARRED pieces of
paper.   We PAN off it and move through a lab - past DOZENS of
failed   experiments. We land on Cynthia, seated at her control
panel,   deep in thought.

SPIDER comes in.

                      SPIDER
            It happened again. One of our
            trucks got hit - they stole a
            radioactive storage unit this time.

Cynthia presses a few keys and a NEWS REPORT plays on her
screen. She SEES the ICE CREAM TRUCK flying away.

                      TV ANCHOR
            Flying ice cream? Another robbery
            today in midtown Manhattan. New
            Yorkers were stunned.

Cynthia looks over to the FLY schematic - clearly RECOVERED
from Stockman's lab. Something OCCURS to her.
                                                          21.

          What Raph?

                    RAPHAEL
          Is it weird to have your head so
          far up dad's butt?

                    MICHELANGELO
          Does it smell weird up there?
                                                22.

Raph gets into position.

                    RAPHAEL
          Okay, eye of the tiger, Raph. Nice

          Who else is gonna do it Mikey?
                                                          23.

          He's gonna die.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Hey why did we pick a fruit shaped
          exactly like my head?

                    DONATELLO
          Your head looks like Stewie had a

                    RAPHAEL
          Just stop talking, you're ruining

                    RAPHAEL (CONT'D)
          Alright, Raph. 3, 2, hya!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Ah!

He tosses a ninja star at the watermelon. It SLICES right
through it and falls off the building, hitting someone-

                    APRIL O'NEIL (O.S.)
          Ah!

                    LEONARDO
          Did you hear that? What was that?

They hurry to the edge of the roof.


SEQ.0400 - CHOP SHOP A


EXT. LOOKING OVER THE EDGE OF THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Down at street level a teenage girl has the ninja star stuck
in her helmet, but she's okay. This is APRIL O'NEIL. Leo
watches April, time slowing down to super slo-motion.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Hey! You on the roof! You just hit
          me in the head with a ninja star!!
          I've had a lot of messed up things
          happen to me, but this?!

                    RAPHAEL
          What's her deal?
                                                        24.


                    DONATELLO
          She's yelling at us a LOT.

                    MICHELANGELO
          I think she's mad that we hit her
          with a ninja star.

                    LEONARDO
          Hey maybe we should go down and
          talk to her, ya know? Check in on
          her?

The others mock him.

                    RAPHAEL
          Yeah what's your pickup line?

                    LEONARDO
          Just to make sure she's okay.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          No! Don't side bar! This is one of
          the most populated cities on planet
          Earth! Alright? You can't be
          running around recklessly with
          weapons!

While April is busy yelling, a dude in a hoodie walks up.

         MICHELANGELO                      LEONARDO
I think that guy is helping     I think he's stealing her
her.                            scooter.

                    MICHELANGELO (CONT'D)
          Hey! Lady behind you!

                    RAPHAEL
          Behind you!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Actually we can skip the
          conversation, you can just cut me a
          check. You owe me money!

                    LEONARDO
          No, your scooter!

April notices her scooter is being stolen.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          What!? No! Hey! Hey! What are you
          doing?!
                                                        25.


                    MICHELANGELO
          He's getting away.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Don't honk at me honk at him!

                    RAPHAEL
          Well, we tried to warn her, nothing
          more we can do. You guys want to
          grab pizza or-

The thief rides off with the scooter and April's backpack.

                    LEONARDO
          No no no, guys she got her scooter
          stolen and it's our fault, we have
          to fix this!

                    DONATELLO
          Yeah man that sucks but...DO we
          have to fix this? I mean
          technically she was just at the
          wrong place at the wrong time, I
          mean it's not really our fault...

                    RAPHAEL
          Exactly yeah...

The camera pushes in on Leo's face.

                    LEONARDO
          I gotta get this scooter back to
          this beautiful and charming human
          woman!!!
              (to the guys)
          Alpha formation!! GO!!

Leo LEAPS off the building, chasing after the thief.

                    DONATELLO
          Whoah! I think all of his hormones
          just kicked in at once.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Follow him!

They follow after him, landing on the street. April hears a
thud but doesn't see them.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          What was that?
                                                        26.


EXT. CHOP SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

They follow the thief up to a Chop Shop where he runs inside.

                    LEONARDO
          Alright guys, guard the exits.
          We're gonna need the most foolproof
          plan. Every single ninja technique.
          Alright, I need you to use stealth
          to block the doors-

                    RAPHAEL
          Did you say go in LOUD? WHOOOO!

                       DONATELLO
          Stop stop-

Raph BUSTS in the front door with his sais out.


SEQ.401 - CHOP SHOP B


INT. CHOP SHOP - CONTINUOUS

They are in a chop shop surrounded by scary looking thugs.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Raph! Raph!

                    RAPHAEL
              (crestfallen)
          Whooo?

                    LEONARDO
          That's a lotta guys. They look
          really mean.

                    THUG #1
          What the heck are those things?

                    THUG #2
          I think it's those guys who work in
          Times Square. You know, the
          mascots? Yeah. The Geico Geckos.

                    THUG #1
          They look more like little Shreks
          to me.

                    LEONARDO
          This is fine. Ya know, we've
          prepared our whole lives for this.
                                                        27.


Leo gulps. This ISN'T fine. They're all freaked out.

                    DONATELLO
          We've never actually    been in a
          fight before...and I    don't know if
          you noticed, but all    I've got is a
          big stick. How did I    end up with a
          big stick?!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Maybe we diffuse this sitch with
          laughter?

                    LEONARDO
          You're not funny enough for that,
          dude.

                    RAPHAEL
          Enough talk! I dream about fighting
          every night!

                    DONATELLO
          You've got a rage problem, Raph.

                       MICHELANGELO
          Oh snap...

                    RAPHAEL
          IT'S NOT A PROBLEM! WOOOO!

Raph charges at the bad guys but immediately slips on oil and
goes down.

                       LEONARDO
          Rogue sai!

One of Raph's sais flies into Donnie's LEG!

                    DONATELLO
          *bloodcurdling scream*

                    LEONARDO
          Oh my god, oh my- I'm gonna be
          sick.

Mikey groans, woozy.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Oh gross! Get it out!

                    DONATELLO
              (screaming)
          It's still in my leg!
                                                        28.


                    LEONARDO
          Mikey watch out!!

A fire extinguisher whizzes through the air and knocks all of
them down into a pile.

                    RAPHAEL
          Get off me!

                    LEONARDO
          Ugh... ok we're not uh- we're not
          off to a great start guys.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Maybe they'll see the humanity in
          our tragic backstory.

                    THUG #1
          MURDER THE SHREKS!!!!!

                    MICHELANGELO
          They don't see it! They don't see
          it!

The thugs charge at them.

                    RAPHAEL
          Think fast, Leo!

                    LEONARDO
          Hey what are you doing! No!

Raph launches Leo towards the guy. He lands a flying kick to
his face!

                       LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Woo!

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Alright Raph, you go left, I go-

Raph ignores him, knocking the thug to the ground.

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          What the heck man, I said go left.

                       RAPHAEL
          I got him!

Raph's hit from behind as more thugs come after them.

                    LEONARDO
          Mikey watch out!
                                                           29.


Mikey runs, sliding over a car. He tries to get in but it's
locked! A thug narrowly misses him with a CROWBAR that breaks
the passenger window.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Ah! Oh snap! Too slow! Psych!

Surrounded, Mikey LEAPS, doing a backflip over the thugs and
crashes through the sun roof of the car.

The RADIO turns on playing Vanilla Ice's "Ninja Rap."

The horn blares.

                    MICHAELANGELO
          Dang that's loud.

He hops out and runs across the room, passing Donnie.

                    DONATELLO
          Back off! I've got a big stick! Ah!

A guy lunges at him. Donnie pushes a wheel cart towards him,
tripping him up. His head SLAMS into a nearby car.

Another thug aims a gun at Raph. Donnie throws a wrench at
him, causing him to miss and fire at the ceiling.

                       RAPHAEL
          What the?!

Raph sets his sights on a thug who's immediately terrified.

                    SCARED THUG
          Sorry, sorry...

Raph THROWS him across the room. Leo gets hit in the face
with something.

                    LEONARDO
          Ow! Guys quit throwing stuff at me!

                    DONATELLO
          What do we do? What do we do?!

Mikey grabs the fire extinguisher to combat the flames.

                    LEONARDO
          Save the scooter!! Save the
          beautiful human woman's scooter!!

VROOOOM!!! A thug revs a car, headlights on the turtles.
                                                        30.


                       MICHELANGELO
          Uh oh.

Mikey JUMPS over the car.

                    MICHELANGELO (CONT'D)
          Ate that no crumbs!

The guy keeps trying to hit them with the car-

                    DONATELLO
          Okay chill out chill out.

-they keep dodging, but it's getting really close.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          Mikey, watch out!

                       MICHELANGELO
          Ah!

Donnie throws his staff through the steering wheel locking
the car in a hard right turn. It starts spinning around in
donuts in the middle of the shop.

                    DONATELLO
          He's Tokyo Drifting around us!!

Raphael springs into action, hops on the roof, reaches in and
puts the car in neutral. Its spins to a stop as Raph lands.

                    RAPHAEL
          I'm awesome.

                       DONATELLO
          Nice!

                       LEONARDO
          Yeah Raph!

The thug looks woozy-

                       THUG #1
          Ughggg....

-and passes out.

                    DONATELLO
          Guys- look around!

The Turtles see all the bad guys are down for the count. Leo
is BEAMING. They did it- they knocked everyone down.
                                                          31.


                    ALL TURTLES
          WHOOOOO!!!!/DID YOU SEE
          THAT?!?!?!?!?!/I totally helped!

Suddenly someone lifts open the garage door.    The turtles
whip around, like deer in headlights!

                    DONATELLO
          Hide! Hide! Hide!

It's April O'Neil carefully entering. She scans the room and
cautiously approaches her scooter.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Hello! I'm an unarmed non-
          combatant, here for her scooter.

She looks around.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Whoooaa... ya'll got your butts
          whooped. This is really not how I
          thought this night was gonna go.

She hears the turtles scrambling to hide...

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Wait where'd you guys go? Hey.

She sees them in the SHADOWS.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Hey I see you in there!

                    TURTLES
          Guys I think she can see us./She
          can't see us./She can totally see
          us!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          I won't make a big deal about the
          ninja star, okay? You got my
          scooter back, so I feel like that's
          square, um...

                    LEONARDO
          Donnie you go out first, you're the
          most inviting and friendly.
                                                        32.


                    APRIL O'NEIL
          I get that you have to like,
          huddle, you know what I mean, but
          the longer you lurk in the shadows,
          like, the more sus it gets every
          second.

                    DONATELLO
          She said we're sus! That's not
          good! That is not good!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah and now it's like doubly sus
          to be whispering about how sus-

Leo is freaked out by this- he holds his brothers back- but
they walk into the light. She GASPS.

                    ALL TURTLES
          Wassup?/Hey.

                      APRIL O'NEIL
          Oh you're like crimefighters with
          turtle costumes. Yeah, I'm gonna be
          honest, I don't think all the good
          animals are taken...
          sharks...there's wolves up for
          grabs... wow, the costumes are really
          crazy-

She POKES Leo's eye.

                     APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          These eyes are wet like real
          eyeballs. How do you get this on
          and off? That's your skin! That's
          your skin!

                    LEONARDO
          Okay she's touching me- that's my
          skin.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          What's goin- what- what are you?
          What could you be?

They don't really know what to say. Then-

                    MICHELANGELO
          Can we explain this over some
          pizza?

April takes a beat.
                                                        33.


                    APRIL O'NEIL
          How you guys feel about pepperoni?

                    ALL TURTLES
          She's down for pizza./Whoah./I
          didn't think it would get this far.


SEQ.0500 - MEETING APRIL


EXT. ROOFTOP - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

April and the Turtles eat pizza on a rooftop. The turtles all
SIMULTANEOUSLY TRY TO EXPLAIN THEIR ORIGIN.

                      ALL TURTLES
          Long ago, my brothers and I were
          all a bunch of turtles.../And this
          guy.../We don't know where we came
          from...

April STOPS THEM-

                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Stop, stop stop stop stop stop!!!
              (beat)
          Okay, you were real baby turtles,
          who made contact with mystery ooze
          and therefore started to age from
          mutant baby turtles to mutant-
          turtle-men-guys?

                    MICHELANGELO
          Turtle boys, actually.

                    RAPHAEL
          Turtle men.

                    LEONARDO
          I would say TEENS... ya know, I
          would say cool teenagers.

She WRITES THAT DOWN.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Teenagers! Amazing, insane. Well
          tell me more, obviously! I want to
          know everything about you. Like,
          like, is there more of you?!

                    DONATELLO
          Nope. Just us!
                                      34.


          APRIL O'NEIL
    (to herself as she writes)
They are alone in the world.
    (to Turtles)
And like nobody's ever asked you
about this or talked to you about
this?

          ALL TURTLES
No./Nope./Yeah you're the first
one./People should talk to us!

          MICHELANGELO
Sometimes we'd pretend to be on
Wendy Williams, but that's it!

          LEONARDO
Why you writing all this down?

          APRIL O'NEIL
Oh well, I'm journalist. Well I
WANT to be a journalist! I write
for my school paper...

          LEONARDO
Really? I assume you'd want to be
on camera... cus you have like a
very camera ready look-

          APRIL O'NEIL
Nope! Nope! NEVER ON CAMERA!!!

          LEONARDO
Okay...

          APRIL O'NEIL
Listen, that's why I'm down here -
I'm researching my this story on
Superfly and his string of super-
crimes. See, the police have been
talking about implementing this
curfew if they don't find him soon,
right? It spooked the parents, and
they cancelled prom!! I'm trying
to, you know help bring him to
justice so everyone can chill out
or whatever. But THIS!!! Turtle
mutant karate teens! I mean this is
a pretty good story!

          RAPHAEL
Look, I don't know if we should.
                                                35.


                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Why not?! This is GOLD! This is so
          good!

                    DONATELLO
          We were taught humans would try to
          destroy us if they ever found out
          we ever existed. You know, kill us!
          Or put us in a lab and milk us!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          I wouldn't milk you! You don't even
          have nipples!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Look, human woman, I got a
          question, so just be straight with
          me: do you think there are more
          people like you? Ya know, people
          who will accept us?

Dramatic beat.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          No. No, absolutely not. Um,
          genuinely no. There's no way.

The turtles all look visibly disappointed.

                    LEONARDO
          Alright yep, it's confirmed, we're
          doomed.

                       RAPHAEL
          I knew it.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Wait wait wait wait. If I'm being
          honest... I mean the reason I'm not
          scared of you is that you guys
          helped me out. And if you hadn't
          and I had just like... stumbled
          across you... yeah... I would be
          very scared. I would be really
          freaked out and disgusted.
              (checking her phone)
          Sorry, my mom is texting.

                     DONATELLO
              (holding up his glowing
               phone)
          Dad is texting us! He's freaking
          out a bit.
                                                        36.


                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Well uh, at least all parents are
          the same?

                       LEONARDO
          100%.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yeah for sure.

                    DONATELLO
          Our dad is definitely not a giant
          rat!!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
              (looks to Donnie)
          That makes me feel like he's a rat.
          Well, I'll airdrop you my contact.
          And if you ever feel like you want
          to come out into the world or
          whatever... just let me know. I
          would love to write the story about
          it, seriously. Good night.

April heads off. Leo watches her go, infatuated.

                    LEONARDO
          I mean, she seemed cool.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Here he goes again. That's your
          type?

                    DONATELLO
          Every girl, man...

                    LEONARDO
          I'm not even that into her. (beat)
          Give me that contact! Give me that
          contact! Please give me the phone!

                    MICHELANGELO
          You got no rizz!!!!


SEQ.0550 - WALK HOME


INT. SEWER HOME - LATER

The turtles walk through the sewers, high on their encounter
with April.
                                                         37.


                    MICHELANGELO
          My mind is just BLOWN! A HUMAN! We
          talked to a human!

                    DONATELLO
          The stick! The stick! You guys saw,
          I was like whaaa!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I want more guys! I got the taste
          of life and I don't wanna wash it
          out of my mouth! I want it to
          linger on my tongue, swish around
          my throat and-

                    DONATELLO
          You're really driving this metaphor
          into the ground, man.

                    RAPHAEL
          But he's right! It was too good to
          give up on!

                    LEONARDO
          But you guys heard April, and the
          words that came out of her
          incredibly formed and beautiful
          mouth... the only reason she liked
          us was because we saved her. She
          saw us as heroes.

                    DONATELLO
          So... what if everyone saw us as
          heroes?

                    MICHELANGELO
          What do you mean?

                    DONATELLO
          I mean, look!!

Donnie points up through some sewer grates to a SCREEN that
is playing the NEWS on the side of a building. The headline:
"SUPERFLY PRIMARY SUSPECT IN LATEST INCIDENT."

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          We use our ninja skills to take out
          Superfly!

As Donnie talks, we see the idealized fantasy version.
                                                38.


                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          We'll drag him up to City Hall,
          dump him on the steps for the cops,
          and say, "We're the heroes who
          stopped Superfly! Yeah we look a
          little different, but we're on your
          side!" And everyone will all be
          like...
              (bad New York accent)
          "Hey, those toitles are alright,
          I'm a cabbie from Da Bronx." Then
          everyone in the city will think
          we're cool! They'll accept us!

                    FAN IN CROWD
          Sign my baby!

                    DONATELLO
          And then, once the overall fanfare
          has settled down, we'll enroll in
          High School, where we'll be normal
          if not slightly more popular than
          average students!

WE SEE THIS PLAY OUT IN THEIR FANTASY.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Okay okay, I'm following this! It's
          like Hulk in Avengers: Endgame!
          Sure, he's a giant terrifying green
          monster, but everyone knows he
          saved them, so they're taking
          selfies with him in a diner!
              (To Donnie)
          You know Mark Ruffalo mostly
          improvised that scene?

                    DONATELLO
          I know, he's good on his feet-

                    RAPHAEL
          Nobody cares about that, okay?!
          This is a great plan! If this
          works, I won't have to hang with
          you losers for the rest of my life!

                    DONATELLO
          That's very true!

                    MICHAELANGELO
          What about Dad though?
                                                       39.


                    DONATELLO
          I mean, he doesn't really need to
          know about it, right...?

They all look at Leo...

                    LEONARDO
          Look, if we're going to do this,
          we're going to have to get April's
          help. Sounds like she's been doing
          tons of research on Superfly. She
          probably has some good leads.

                    RAPHAEL
          Whoah whoah whoah whoah whoah.
          Whoah! So you're IN??!!!

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah, I'm in.

                    TURTLES
          OHHHHHHHH!!!!/WOOOOO!!!/YEAHHH!/
          LET'S GO!/ We did it! Mikey!

                                                  CUT TO:


SEQ.575 - CALLING APRIL


INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

April stands in a subway car. Her phone rings.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Hello? Turtle... fellas? Hey! Is
          that you guys, for real?


INT. SEWER HOME - CONTINUOUS

The Turtles are gathered around the cell phone.

                    LEONARDO
              (into phone)
          Hi April. Yes... It's LEO...

His voice cracks. The others laugh.

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Ya know we were talking and we have
          a proposal.
                                                        40.


                    APRIL (O.S.)
          Okay.

                    LEONARDO
          You help us find Superfly, we bring
          him to justice... You document it
          all... and when we got him, you
          release the story, your prom is un-
          cancelled, and we get accepted by
          the world as heroes.


INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Wow! YES! Uh yeah, okay sure! I
          mean if I'm being honest, I totally
          even stopped even thinking about
          this...I had a lot of things to
          do...

WE SEE HER NOTEBOOK, it's COVERED in notes about the turtles.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          By the way, do you guys have ears?


INT. SEWER HOME - CONTINUOUS

                    MICHELANGELO
          Just say yes! Just say yes!

                    LEONARDO
          I think so?


INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

                    APRIL O'NEIL (ON PHONE)
          They think you have ears...

She writes that down.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Okay perfect! Yes, um...


INT. SEWER HOME - CONTINUOUS

                    APRIL O'NEIL (O.S.)
          How about we meet tonight, 8 pm,
          Eastman High. Everyone will be
          gone. And I've got all my research
          in the school dark room.
                                                          41.


                    LEONARDO
          Cool. Cool. So uh... it's a date.

                       APRIL O'NEIL
          Wait what?

                       DONATELLO
          What?!

                    RAPHAEL
          No! Hang up man! Just stop talking!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Abort! Abort!

                    LEONARDO
          I mean... uh... I have bad service
          or something, I'll see ya tonight!!

He hangs up. Turns to his brothers, SMILING.

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Who's got no rizz now?

The turtles FILE out of the sewer, all talking at once.
Splinter WATCHES.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Goodbye, kisses!

                    SPLINTER
          What are they up to?


SEQ.0825 - TURTLES IN HIGH SCHOOL


EXT. NEW YORK EVENING - LATER

The turtles SNEAK through the city, hopping from rooftop to
rooftop.


EXT. EASTMAN HIGH - MOMENTS LATER

April watches as the turtles DESCEND down the fire escape of
a building and land across from the school.

                       LEONARDO
          Hey!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Hey! You actually made it! That
          seemed very dangerous.
                                                           42.


                    LEONARDO
          Oh that? Ha! Not at all. We eat
          danger for breakfast.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Actually, I eat pizza with bits of
          waffles on it.

                    DONATELLO
          It's better than it sounds.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          It actually sounds delicious,
          honestly.
              (holding door open)
          Okay well, come on in.

The guys are TERRIFIED to enter.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Really? We can just... go in there?

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah, of course!


INT. EASTMAN HIGH HALLWAY - LATER

April ushers the turtles inside.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Welcome to Eastman High.

They enter as though they're entering some sacred temple.
Fear and reverence and excitement.

                    TURTLES
          Wow...

April watches the turtles take in the school, their eyes
wide. WE SEE a "PROM: CANCELLED" poster.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          This is very strange. I feel like
          you guys actually WANT to go to
          high school.

                    RAPHAEL
          Yeah we do! We VERY much do! Why
          don't you love high school?
                                                        43.


                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Oh yeah, as a very popular and well-
          liked person I LOVE high school
          yeah, but don't worry about me.
              (beat)
          Is this living up to your dreams?

                    DONATELLO
          No.
              (then)
          It's even BETTER!

He spots a DRAWING on a locker.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          Attack on Titan!! Whoever's locker
          this is likes anime!! I don't even
          know this person and they get me
          more than anyone ever has!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Guys, look!

Mikey runs over to a poster that reads IMPROV TEAM TRY-OUTS!

                    MICHELANGELO (CONT'D)
          Ohmygodohmygodohmygod. Improv team
          tryouts. I've gotta sign up. This
          is amazing!!!!

                    LEONARDO
          Mikey what are you doing, we don't
          even go here.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yet! The tryouts aren't for two
          weeks. We could be enrolled by
          then!
              (reading)
          They need a last name. Wait, what's
          our last name?

                    LEONARDO
          I don't...I've never thought about
          that actually...

                    RAPHAEL
          Do we not have last names?

                    DONATELLO
          Who are we?
                                                         44.


                    MICHELANGELO
          It's okay! I'll just break it up...
              (writing)
          Michael Angelo.
              (Italian accent)
          Hey! I'm Michael Angelo! Perfecto!

                    RAPHAEL
          That makes you Leo Nardo!!!

                    DONATELLO
          NARDOOOO!!!

                    LEONARDO
          It could be Leon Ardo! That's a
          cool name! Leon!

                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Guys! Lay off of Nardo! He's
          sensitive!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Haha she called him Nardo too!

                    DONATELLO
          Nardo!

                    LEONARDO
          Hey well, at least I'm not Puke
          Girl! Ha! THAT is a bad nickname!!

They go over to a locker with PUKE GIRL written on it.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          We don't know if that says Puke
          Girl! It could say Poke Girl! Maybe
          this girl just likes tuna!

They see "April O'PUKE" scrawled on the locker.

                    RAPHAEL
          Oh my god, are you puke girl?!!

                    MICHELANGELO
          She's puke girl!!

                    DONATELLO
          We all know that does not say poke.

                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Alright, stop! Listen, listen!
          Huhhh...
              (beat)
                     (MORE)
                                                        45.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          I told you ever since I was young I
          wanted to be a journalist - and so
          thought I could read the morning
          announcements... and you know,
          well... it didn't go so well.

FLASHBACK -

WE SEE APRIL sitting behind a little NEWS DESK - bright
lights, cameras - a KID POINTS AT HER! You're ON! Her HEART
IS BEATING - SWEAT -

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          I dunno, maybe the cameras and
          attention got to me - and the
          anxiety made me feel like I was
          gonna explode...

WE PUSH in as something is BUILDING INSIDE HER.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          And so...well...

BACK TO SCHOOL HALLWAY.

                    LEONARDO
          You didn't.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          I did.

She HOLDS UP HER PHONE and we SEE THE FOOTAGE OF HER PUKING
on the morning announcements.


                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          I went viral. I was remixed.

WE SEE THAT.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Memed.

WE SEE THAT.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          The sound trended on Tik Tok.

WE SEE THAT.
                                                        46.


                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          I thought, if I use the paper to
          find Superfly and get prom un-
          cancelled, I can remain FIRMLY off
          camera, but also... maybe I dunno,
          be known for something cool instead
          of...

                    RAPHAEL
          What, being puke girl? You don't
          want that anymore? No?

Leo smacks him in the back.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Great, laugh, whatever. But maybe
          you're not the only ones who want
          to be heroes so people like them,
          okay? Can we go?


SEQ.0850 - THE DARK ROOM


INT. DARK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

April leads them into the DARK ROOM.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Alright, here's what I got.

April presents the turtles with her CONSPIRACY CORK BOARD of
SUPERFLY!! There's NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS of CRIMES. There's
CRIMINAL MUGSHOTS, OBITUARIES of CRIMINALS, and tons of other
insane imagery, connected by a thousand threads. They all
ORBIT a GIANT question mark towards the top of the board that
says "WHO IS SUPERFLY?"

                    ALL TURTLES
          WHOAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Yes, yes, it's incredibly
          impressive.
              (beat)
          Okay, listen. Superfly seems to be
          building something. I mean we're
          talking Gru, Megamind type stuff.
          He's knocking off insanely, highly
          technical shipments. State of the
          art, incredibly expensive. And he
          pays off thugs to do his dirty work
          so he can stay completely under the
          radar. Nobody's ever seen his face.
                                                        47.


                    MICHELANGELO
          Why?

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Because he kills everyone who does!

                    TURTLES
          Woah!!!

                    RAPHAEL
          Cool!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          No, not cool.

                    LEONARDO
          So... how are we gonna find him?

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          You know the Ice Cream Truck heist
          last week, right? They stole a
          radioactive storage unit - and
          look! I found THIS at the chop shop
          where they took my scooter -

It's a SCHEMATIC OF A RADIOACTIVE STORAGE UNIT. She gestures
to her board with MUGSHOTS of criminals.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          They must be doing business with
          Superfly. That chop shop is run by
          these guys and their crew-

She points to pictures of THUGS and CRIMINALS outside of the
chop shop, and other bars and clubs.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Short Sharon, Bald Bronson, Toupee
          Tom and Normal Nate. They are the
          ones who can lead us to Superfly.

They LOOK AT THE BIG BOARD.

                    LEONARDO
          That's a lot of leads.

                    MICHAELANGELO
          And a lot of terrible nicknames.

                    RAPHAEL
          Still better than Nardo.

                    LEONARDO
          Hey we agreed on Leon Ardo.
                                                           48.


                      APRIL O'NEIL
            Let's start chasing them down.


SEQ.1250 - CRIME FIGHTING MONTAGE


CRIME FIGHTING MONTAGE

We see:

-Using April's insane cork board, they target criminals with
ties to Superfly.

-The turtles absolutely whipping the shit out of men at
various chop shops, speakeasies, and gambling dens. It's
almost poetic (a la Raph's slo-mo ass-kicking sequence).

- The turtles sneaking past Splinter as he's asleep in his
chair.

- WE SEE April in the hallway of the school - the kids READ
her work on Superfly and a kid who was writing "Puke Girl" on
April's locker has stopped half-way through and is reading
too.

-The turtles starting to get a little cocky as they beat up
bad guys, seeming to enjoy the process.

-The turtles trying on human clothes in an alleyway as two
thugs sit on the ground, tied up.

-The turtles hide human clothes in their room under their
beds.

-WE SEE cuts of them interrogating Gangsters (each one looks
how they're described).

                      BALD BRONSON
            Normal Nate deals with that!

                      NORMAL NATE
            I'm just a legitimate mattress
            salesman! You want Short Sharon!

And then-

                      SHORT SHARON
                (in Cantonese)
             I don't talk to stupid turtles!
            You're looking for Toupee Tom!

And then-
                                                        49.


                    TOUPEE TOM
          Hey hey hey, I don't talk but if I
          did talk, I'd tell ya it was Bad
          Bernie you were looking for. But
          you didn't hear it from me, ya
          know?

                    RAPHAEL
          WHERE'S BAD BERNIE?!!

-The turtles interrogate a final gangster.

                     BAD BERNIE
          OKAY! I'll talk!
              (beat)
          Yeah alright, my guys stole this
          radioactive storage unit. But
          Superfly, he kills them, then he
          calls me and says I gotta get him
          another thing, an assimilator. And
          if I don't do it, he's gonna kill
          me too!

FLASHBACK -


EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

WE SEE BAD BERNIE and his CREW TAKING OUT GUARDS as they
SNEAK into a SECURE part of the DOCKS. They open a SHIPPING
CONTAINER. They find a new RADIOACTIVE STORAGE UNIT. Bernie
SMILES.

                    BAD BERNIE
          So, last night, we got one. The
          deal with Superfly is tonight,
          under the bridge. We give him his
          unit and he leaves us alone.

BACK TO BERNIE AND THE TURTLES...

                    RAPHAEL
          Good. You did good.

Raph KNOCKS OUT Bad Bernie.

                    LEONARDO
          Dude!! He talked!
                                                50.


SEQ.1260 - BACON EGG AND CHEESE


EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

                    DONATELLO
          That was so exhilarating! The
          adrenaline pumping in my veins is
          crazy!

                    LEONARDO
          Superfly is making a deal with Bad
          Bernie's guys TONIGHT. In an hour,
          under the Brooklyn Bridge.

                    RAPHAEL
          We show up in Bernie's van with the
          goods, and BOOM! Superfly is caught
          in our WEB!!! Did you get that
          April? Did you film that?!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Sorry am I supposed to film all the
          stuff you do? Cus a lot of it's
          dumb.

                    RAPHAEL
          Yes!

                    DONATELLO
          I'll do the talking!
              (doing NY accent)
          "Ehhh... I'm a gangster... I got my
          puffer and my Tims. I need my bacon
          egg and cheese too. You got the
          goods Superfly?!?!"

                    ALL TURTLES
          Bacon egg and cheese!/Lemme get
          that bacon egg and cheese!/Bacon
          Egg and CHEESE!/Yo Ock! Lemme get
          that bacon egg and cheese!/With the
          bev!/We OUTSIDE!/You heard!
          Yerddd!/Bacon Egg and CHEESE!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah, I don't think this is gonna
          help people like you. Just being
          honest.

                    ALL TURTLES
          Bacon egg and cheese!/Lemme get dat
          bacon egg and cheese!
                                                  51.


Donnie's phone rings.

                    DONATELLO
          Uh oh, text from dad.

Donnie holds it up: BOYS! EMERGENCY! COME HOME!


SEQ.1270 - SURPRISE PARTY


INT. SEWER HOME - LATER

The turtles and April hustle through the sewer.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          What do you think is wrong?

                    DONATELLO
          I bet that cat is back! He freaks
          out every time!

                    LEONARDO
          He probably just can't get the Roku
          working again.

                    RAPHAEL
          Hopefully it's quick and we can
          just meet up with Superfly.

                    LEONARDO
          Alright April, we live just up
          there, but our dad... he doesn't
          really like humans-

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Rude. I mean to be fair... I don't
          love rats, so...

                    LEONARDO
          And that's totally fair!

                    RAPHAEL
          Understandable. But uh, just wait
          here, ok? We'll be back in a few.

April looks at her shoes in the sewer water.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          And there's a cockroach surfing on
          a turd. Awesome. Good. Love that
          I'm looking at that.
                                                        52.


INT. SEWER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

The turtles cautiously enter the SEWER.

The LIGHTS TURN ON!

                       SPLINTER
          Surprise!!

                       TURTLES
          AHHH!!

They look and see Splinter has set up a little PARTY in the
sewer home. There's a bunch of pizzas laid out.

                    LEONARDO
          Come on dad, you really can't keep
          scaring us like that.

                    DONATELLO
          What is all this?

                    SPLINTER
          Welcome home!!

                    LEONARDO
          Why are there balloons in here?

                    DONATELLO
          Dad... what are you doing?

                    SPLINTER
          Look... I'm not stupid. I know
          something's up.

                       RAPHAEL
          You do?

                    SPLINTER
          I do. You're done with the sewers.
          You want to be in the human world.
          I went through your stuff... and I
          found your human clothes!

He shows them the human CLOTHES. The turtles don't know what
to say.

                    TURTLES
          What?!/Those aren't ours./How did
          that even get in our stuff?

                    SPLINTER
          Boys, boys it's ok. I think I have
          found a way to make you happy.
                    (MORE)
                                                        53.

                    SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          I brought the human world to you!
          Look!

He reveals a bunch of CUTOUTS of celebrities he clearly got
from old movie standees: (Chris Pine, Chris Evans, and Chris
Pratt).

                    SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          Human friends! Hello! I'm a human.
          Say hi to Chris! I'm Chris Pine!
          Look at my eyebrows. I'm the best
          Chris! Amazing, right?

                      RAPHAEL
          That is...what we love...

He drapes a towel over his arm.

                    SPLINTER
          And watch - I'm a waiter! The full
          human restaurant experience! Sit
          down! Let me take your order! It
          could be anything. But it has to be
          pizza.

The boys look to the table, then each other.

                    TURTLES
          Uhhh./Pizza./Right.

                    LEONARDO
          Uh... look dad, we appreciate it,
          but we still got more errands to
          run.

Splinter stops. Looks at his boys.

                    SPLINTER
          What is going on? What are you
          doing up there? Don't lie. Tell me.
          Are you in trouble? Is something
          wrong? Is someone trying to milk
          you?

                    TURTLES
          No!/Ew!/It's never milking!/Why
          would somebody do that?!

                    DONATELLO
          Why do you always jump right to
          milking?!
                                                           54.


                    SPLINTER
          Do you need help? Anything you
          need, I'm here.

They look to each other.

                    LEONARDO
          No. Dad look, we're just running
          errands, shopping, getting the
          stuff we need to live down here.

                    SPLINTER
          Really? That's it?

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah. That's, that is quite
          literally it.

                    RAPHAEL
          Nothing else.

                    LEONARDO
          Alright well hey thanks for the
          surprise...party.

                    RAPHAEL
          Yup, appreciate it dad. We will be
          leaving....

                     LEONARDO
          Goodbye.

The turtles leave. Splinter watches them go.


SEQ.1450 - ENTER THE SUPERFLY


EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - LATER

The TURTLES pull up in the VAN under the Brooklyn bridge
where countless gangster scenes have taken place.

                    RAPHAEL
          Wow, you're actually a good driver,
          Donnie.

                    DONATELLO
          Countless hours on Forza Horizon
          finally paid off!

                    APRIL O'NEIL (O.S.)
              (through headset)
          Hey guys.
                                                        55.


                    LEONARDO
          Uh hello, April, you there?

WE SEE APRIL, filming from a vantage point not too far away.
They talk through a bluetooth earpiece.

                     APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah I got you.
              (beat)
          Now just know, this footage is
          going to be the definitive imagery
          of your entire existences... so
          um... like don't make it lame or
          anything.

                      RAPHAEL
          Good one!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Hey we're not the ones who puked on
          camera.

                    LEONARDO
          We would have to try really hard to
          do that, actually.

                    DONATELLO
          Hey shut up shut up look! Here he
          comes!

We see a TWO AWESOME CARS and a MOTORCYCLE SLOWLY
APPROACHING.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Look at those cars!

                    RAPHAEL
          He's got some swagger to him!

                    MICHELANGELO
          This guy is Superfly!

                    DONATELLO
          The horsepower must be crazy!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I mean, look at those rims bro!

                    LEONARDO
          Alright guys, there's two cars and
          a motorcycle, that's like ten dudes
          tops.
                                                        56.


                    RAPHAEL
          Oh man, they're gonna be SO SCARED
          when they see they're about to roll
          up on a bunch of mutants! HAHAHA!!

ANGLE ON: Superfly's cars pull up across from the Turt's Van.

One of the car door opens, and a DARK FIGURE EMERGES, the car
RAISING from the relief his massive weight. The figure steps
into the light. It's a GIANT WARTHOG MAN (BEBOP). The turtles
look SHOCKED.

Bebop holds up an 80's style BOOMBOX AND HITS PLAY.

MUSIC UP: WAKE UP IN THE SKY by GUCCI MANE.

ANGLE ON APRIL:

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Oh my god I'm gonna win a Daytime
          Emmy.

                    MICHELANGELO
          What do we do, Leo?

                    LEONARDO
          Uh I dunno I...

                    DONATELLO
          You're the leader! You should know!

                    RAPHAEL
          Alpha? Alpha formation?

                    DONATELLO
          You don't even know what Alpha
          Formation is!

As the opening chords echo out, we see another DOOR OPEN. A
MONSTROUS FOOT steps OUT. We get GLIMPSES of this CREATURE as
it emerges from the car, and STEPS towards the GANGSTERS to
the beat of the music. We see a GIANT CLAW, ANTENNAE, WEIRD
HANDS, GIANT WINGS (one of which is HALF MISSING). The
CREATURE is FINALLY REVEALED -

It's a HULKING, TERRIFYING FLY MAN.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          What is that?
                                                          57.


From the CARS BEHIND him emerge his CREW   - a Manta Ray Man
(Ray Fillet), a Toad Man (Genghis Frog),   a Crocodile Lady
(Leatherhead), a Rhino Man (Rocksteady),   a Surfer Lizard
(Mondo Gecko) Bebop, and then a Bat Lady   LANDS in line
(Wingnut).

                    SUPERFLY
              (yelling to the van)
          Yooo!!!! Come on ya'll! Let's get

      EXT. BOWLING ALLEY/ARCADE - CONTINUOUS

      April watches from across the street. She SPEAKS into her
      earphones.

                          APRIL O'NEIL
                Hey guys? What's going on in there?

      ANGLE ON: Leo and Superfly.

      Leo SPEAKS QUIETLY into his earpiece.
                                                           63.


                    LEONARDO
              (quiet)
          Still... not sure if I'm being
          honest.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Okay well ask him more questions!
          Figure out what the hell is going
          on with this dude!

A bunch of PIZZA and SNACKS are laid out on a big table.
Everyone gathers around and starts to eat.

                    LEONARD
          So um, maybe you can finish
          explaining like exactly where you
          came from and what you want and
          stuff?

                    SUPERFLY
          What do I want? Oh, easy.
          Acceptance.

The turtles look at each other.

                    LEONARDO
          No way man! We want that too!

                    SUPERFLY
          Lemme go back to the start...

WE SEE EVERYTHING DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF THEIR ORIGIN:

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          My earliest memory in the world is
          my dad telling me that he never was
          accepted... he just wanted a family
          man. That's why he created us. But
          then...that's when the people he
          worked for sent the ops through.
          They took it from him. I rescued my
          little baby brother and sister, and
          since I was the oldest, ya know, I
          had to raise them.

WE SEE THEM SETTLE DOWN in the SHIP GRAVEYARD. THEY WATCH an
ad for an ITALIAN RESTAURANT on TV.

                    BEBOP
          He did a great job.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          He did.
                                                        64.


                    BEBOP
          We're very well adjusted!

                     SUPERFLY
          Anyway... We thought... these
          humans, yeah they murdered our dad,
          but, maybe they just ain't ALL bad,
          you know?
              (beat)
          We went out and we hit the town.
          And... it didn't go well.
          Especially this one dude man... he
          wouldn't stop chasing us. He wanted
          to kill us!

                    LEONARDO
          Oh my god that's what happened to
          us!

                    DONATELLO
          That's why our dad made us live in
          the sewer our whole lives.

                    SUPERFLY
          Well not me! That sounds like a
          punk choice. You know what I did?
          I beat that fool down. I touched
          that chin, molly whopped him! Wop
          wop. To an inch of his life. Bop!

Superfly CRUSHES a bottle of ketchup. It splatters all over.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          And then, I knew what to do. I
          decided to kill ALL the humans, and
          let the MUTANTS RULE THE EARTH!!

The Turtles stare at him in shock.

                    MICHELANGELO
          That's a take!

                     SUPERFLY
          I inherited my dad's mind for
          science and I thought, what if I
          built a machine to enact my plan!?
          I've been stealing all the parts
          that I need, and now, I'm ready!
              (beat)
          I'm gonna use a little of my blood
          to create a weaponized version of
          the ooze, then we gonna LAUNCH it
          into the atmosphere and watch it
          VAPORIZE!
                     (MORE)
                                                     65.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          Here's the kicker, every animal on
          EARTH will be transformed into a
          mutant. Every fly, flea, tick,
          snake, fish and whale. Everything!
          And we become the dominant species
          on earth.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
              (listening in)
          That's bad! That's very bad. For
          me.

                    DONATELLO
          Wait what happens to humans in this
          plan of yours?

                    SUPERFLY
          Nothing good!

                    MONDO GECKO
          We wish there was another way to
          feel safe and happy, but
          peoples...they gotsta go.

                    SUPERFLY
          A bunch of `em gonna be eaten,
          enslaved, turned into a fuel of
          some sort. Maybe they'll become a
          form of entertainment, know what I
          mean? You know how they used to
          have the dog shows and the horse
          races? Well maybe we'll have red
          head shows, fat booty boy races.
          Baby tossing. Something like that,
          you know, I'll think of something
          stupid.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Wow, that's...that's even worse.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          They should be pets!

          Cus now that I got   this, I can
          complete my device   and...

          So what's up, you wanna roll with
          us? Cus we can activate the machine

          Yeah!/Take over!/Yay Fillet!/Yeah
          little dudes! Yeah!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Hey... just checking in, you

          make me film you supplying an evil
          villain with the last piece of his
          horrible puzzle? You're gonna stop
          him?! You're gonna stop him.
          Somebody? Just talk so I know
          you're gonna stop him.

                    LEONARDO
              (to Superfly)
          Yo uh Superfly... So what if we're
          actually, like... I dunno I'm just
          like, I'm getting silly here, what
          if we're not into the plan? What if
          we don't like it, what would
          happen?

                     RAPHAEL
          Yeah just hypothetically speaking,
          obviously.

Superfly stops and TURNS slowly to the turtles.

                    SUPERFLY
          Well... that would mean that I was
          wrong about you. And you're all not
          as cool as I thought you was.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          And that right there... would piss
          me off.

Superfly STOMPS on a FIRE HYDRANT, CRUSHING it like a tin
can.

                    ALL TURTLES
          Woah!/Uh.../We uh.../We don't...

                    SUPERFLY
          I'm about to go to 100 on y'all.

                    ALL TURTLES
          No no no!/No!/Cousins,
          remember!/Cuz!

                    SUPERFLY
          Man don't cuz me right now man!
          Drop that man, that's got nothing
          to do with that.

                    LEONARDO
          Listen man, we were just joking
          around because we are in fact very
          into your plan. It's like great. I
          love the killing people part.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah... I'll cut around that.

                    DONATELLO
              (to the turtles)
          Guys I got an idea.
              (to Superlfly)
          So uh, S-fly my man, we'll drive
          the van with the storage unit, and
          you lead the way!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Nice. Smooth.

                     SUPERFLY
          Cool, but I drive fast, and I don't
          want y'all to get lost. So Mondo,
          Wingnut, Rock, ride with the
          tortoises.

                    MONDO GECKO
          I'll drive!!

                    RAPHAEL
          You're uhh, you're good to drive?
                                                         68.


                    MONDO GECKO
          (laughing) No!

The turtles get in the back of the van TRAPPED and TERRIFIED.
Mondo Gecko pulls away.


INT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER

The turtles whisper in the back. Mondo and Wingnut are
arguing about what to play on the radio.

                    WINGNUT
          Spice Girls! Put `em on!

                    MONDO GECKO
          You don't like Phish?

                    WINGNUT
          What? Phish? No, Spice Girls!!

                    MONDO GECKO
          Jam bands are the best bro!

                    WINGNUT
          No, jam is something you put on
          toast!

                    DONATELLO
          Hey dudes, fun cruising with you
          but...where are we going exactly?

                    MONDO GECKO
          Oh see that building over there?
          That's not it. Haha no, we're going
          to the this super cool shipping
          graveyard over in Staten Island.
          It's the best borough, bro.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          I LOVE Staten Island!


EXT. NYC STREET - CONTINUOUS

APRIL FOLLOWS THE CARS on her scooter, struggling to keep up!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Okay, it's go time! Attack these
          fools!
                                                     69.


                    RAPHAEL
              (whispering)
          Not sure that's as easy as it
          sounds. I mean this dude is
          literally a rhinoceros man.

                    MONDO GECKO
          I gots an idea. How about something
          we can all sing along to?!!

"What's Up" by 4 Non Blondes comes on the radio.

                    LEONARDO
              (whispering)
          But look if we jam the breaks,
          they'll just fly out the front of
          the car. There's no windshield or
          anything.

                    MICHELANGELO
          It's impossible. We'd need like a
          long and narrow device that's small
          enough to get under the seat, but
          strong enough to press the pedal.

                    DONATELLO
          You mean... a stick?

                    MONDO GECKO
          I got it! 4 Non B's!


ANGLE ON: MONDO, WINGNUT AND ROCKSTEADY.

They're all singing along to the radio.

                    MONDO GECKO/WINGNUT/ROCKSTEADY
          ...AND I STEP OUTSIDE AND I TAKE A
          DEEP BREATH AND I GET REAL HIGH AND
          I SCREAM FROM THE TOP OF MY LUNGS
          WHAT'S GOING ON?!

                    WINGNUT
          How good is this?!

                    DONATELLO
          Time of my life!

                    WINGNUT
          God they're good!

THEY ALL START TO SING ALONG!
                                                           70.


Then- Donnie's stick slides UNDER THE SEAT and JAMS THE
BREAKS! THEY'RE SINGING THE WHOLE TIME. They FLY OUT THE
FRONT OF THE CAR, HITTING THE ROAD. As MONDO FLIES - HE LOOKS
AT MIKEY.

                    MONDO GECKO
          WHAT'S...GOING...ON????

                    MICHELANGELO
          Sooorrrryyyyyyy....

ANGLE ON: SUPERFLY - seeing the VAN MAKE A HARD TURN AND
SPEED off, the MUTANTS left on the ground.

                    SUPERFLY
          What the-?!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Dang, ya'll better hurry!

                    BEBOP
          Hey you hurt Rock, I hurt you!


INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

Donnie DRIVES AS FAST AS HE CAN!


SEQ.1495 - THE CHASE


EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The turtles SPEED down the road. April is on a PARALLEL road,
watching the action unfold.

                    DONATELLO
          Don't worry guys! I got this!!

Scumbug appears and PUKES all over the turtles, then flies
away!

                    TURTLES
          AHHH!!!! NOOO!!!

                    DONATELLO
          I don't got this! I don't got this!


He SWERVES AROUND!!

Bebop's BRONCO pulls up alongside the turtles van.
                                                        71.


                    BEBOP
          You're dead, tortoises!!

Donnie SWERVES them into parked cars-

                    BEBOP (CONT'D)
          Ah! Woah! Hey no!

-but Bebop easily drives over them.

                    BEBOP (CONT'D)
          You can't stop me it's a monster
          truck dummos! Get `em Mondo!!!

Mondo Gecko leaps onto the roof.

                     MICHELANGELO
          Donnie!

                    MONDO GECKO
          Yo dudes! You launched me out of
          the front of that van! That is not
          cool!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I'm so sorry, we had to!!!

                    MONDO GECKO
          You know what? I don't accept that
          apology!

                     RAPHAEL
          Yeah I'm not sorry at all, I'm not
          gonna lie!

                     MONDO GECKO
          Woahh!!!

Raph punches Mondo in the face sending him flying from the
car. Mondo lands on his TAIL ROLLER-SKATE and keeps a grip on
the bumper.

On the other side, Rocksteady sideswipes them with his
motorcycle. LEATHERHEAD tries to get on board the van from
her motorcycle!

                    ROCKSTEADY
          Hey I'm back ya green punks!

                    LEATHERHEAD
          Stop it ya bloody hooligans or I'll
          bite ya bloody heads off!

WINGNUT SWOOPS in front of the van!
                                                        72.


                    WINGNUT
          Superfly is almost here and he's
          not going to be as nice about this!

                    LEONARDO
          You're not being nice!

                    WINGNUT
          He'll be less nice!!

Superfly floors it, catching up to them.

                    MONDO GECKO
          It's now or never dudes! Give us
          the device!

Superfly effortlessly RIPS the back off the van.

Donnie adjusts the rearview mirror and sees him, HUGE and
TERRIFYING.

                    SUPERFLY
          6 in the morning, police at my
          door.

Superfly punches Raph in the face, knocking him unconscious.

Leo tries to draw a sword but it gets stuck in the roof of
the van! Superfly grabs his other sword and pins Leo against
the wall.

                     MICHAELANGELO
          LEO!!!

Michelango pulls out his nunchucks. Superfly snips the chain
making them USELESS.

                    MICHELANGELO
          My `chucks!!!

                     DONATELLO
          Guys?

Superfly RIPS the steering wheel off!

                     DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          AHHHH!!!

He grabs Donnies BO STAFF and PUSHES Donnie's foot against
the accelerator, wedging it agains the ceiling!

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          No! He used my stick against me!!!!
          Ah! Now he's molly-whopping me!
                                                        73.


The van accelerates!

                    SUPERFLY
          Man, I almost thought y'all was
          cool. See you in hell turtles!


                    RAPHAEL
          Quick grab it!

Leo lunges out of the van, grabbing one end of the device
while Superfly firmly holds the other. Mikey grabs Leo by the
legs, trying to to reel him back in.

                       MICHELANGELO
          Ahh!

                    LEONARDO
          I'm getting ripped in two!

WE PUSH IN ON GENGHIS FROG.

                    GENGHIS FROG
          Goochi, goochi, goo.

Superfly flies away with the Device, the hot rods peel off
into the night and the turtles CRASH off of a freeway
overpass.

                       ALL TURTLES
          Ahhhh!!!

They land on the street, front first, TOTALING the van just
as TCRI pulls up on them.

The turtles stumble from the wreckage. The soldiers look at
them.

                     SPIDER
          Go go go go! Surround them, make a
          perimeter!

The turtles see APRIL on the overpass-

                    LEONARDO
          April... Help...

But she SPEEDS OFF!!

                    SPIDER
          Say goodnight, freak.

Spider hits Leo in the face as we see his POV fade to black.
                                                        74.

A HUGE SECURITY TEAM guards them, heavily armed.

          There's a fly monster--

Utrom hit's a button that SHOCKS Donnie!

EXT. STATEN ISLAND BOAT GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS

A few gentle guitar notes are solemnly heard. A beautiful
somber and slowed down rendition of WHAT'S UP begins, sung
with an unbelievably beautiful voice.

                    VOICE
              (singing)
          And so I cry sometimes when I'm
          lying in bed.

Wingnut, Leatherhead and Bebop work diligently.

Superfly LANDS in his LAB holding the equipment.

                    VOICE (CONT'D)
              (singing)
          Just to get it all out what's in my
          head.

Superfly starts connecting pieces of the machine, hurrying
towards completion.

                    VOICE (CONT'D)
          And I, I am feeling a little
          peculiar.

THE CAMERA slowly reveals a MASSIVE, TERRIFYING DOOMSDAY
MACHINE. Superfly has a look of evil determination in his
eyes. The mutants have a sad look in their eyes.

                    VOICE (CONT'D)
              (singing)
          And so I wake in the morning-

                    SUPERFLY
          Ray Fillet, man shut your mouth! If
          I wanted to be sad, I'd go listen
          to some damn John Legend.

We reveal Mondo is on the guitar with Ray Fillet singing
beside him.

                    RAY FILLET
          Sorry.

                    MONDO GECKO
          Sorry bro...
                                                           77.


                    SUPERFLYY
          Remember this is a happy day!
          Because we're gonna kill every
          human on this big ol' ugly Earth!
          So smile Mondo!

Superfly stares at his machine, a look of madness in his
eyes, whereas the mutants exchange sad looks of worry.


SEQ.1815 - SPLINTER AND APRIL


INT. SEWER HOME

Splinter sits alone, watching the party balloons deflate. He
thumbs through family photos. In one, he and the kids are
happy. In the next, they're teenagers and look miserable.

Splinter sighs. Then, hears footsteps behind him.

                    SPLINTER
          Boys? You came home? You forgive
          me? My surprise party worked?

He turns to see April.

                    SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          Ah! GET BACK! I'll bite you!!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Heyyyy Mr. Rat...man... I'm April,
          I, uh, I come in peace! I'm friends
          with your sons.

Splinter is confused by this.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          And right now, they're in trouble.


WE PUSH IN ON SPLINTER.


SEQ.1825 - MILK THE TURTLES


INT. T.C.R.I. - SECRET LAB - CONTINUOUS

Mikey is getting MILKED!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Ahh! No no no no! Stop it! Ahhh!
                                                        78.


                    LEONARDO
          That looks bad!

                    DONATELLO
          Does it hurt?!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Of courses it hurts!! She's milking
          me!!!

WE SEE his OOZE BLOOD draining out of him via tubes.

                    RAPHAEL
          Try to think of something pleasant
          to take your mind off the pain!

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah yeah! Think of pizza Mikey!
          Think of the pizza!

                    MICHELANGELO
          No! Pizza's made of cheese! And
          cheese is made of MILK! And I'm
          being milked!! It's infiltrated my
          every thought!! AHHH!!

                    LEONARDO
          I'm so sorry Mikey!

Utrom gestures to a GIANT CONTAINER filling slowly with his
ooze blood.

                    CYNTHIA UTROM
          Continue milking them until we have
          the required amount.

                    TURTLES
          AHH!!!/This lady's evil!/Oww!


SEQ.1850 - SPLINTER TO THE RESCUE

She LEAVES. RAPH STARTS getting milked.

                    RAPHAEL
          Well, this is it guys. We're gonna
          die here getting milked to death in
          a lab!

The GRAVITY REALLY starts to hit them.
                                                79.


                    LEONARDO
          I can't believe April just left
          us... I mean... Maybe she was just
          using us...

The hang their heads.

                    RAPHAEL
          Well she ended up getting a great
          story. "Turtle boys GIVE
          supervillain last part of his evil
          machine..."

                    LEONARDO
          You know that's actually a pretty
          good title I guess.

                    DONATELLO
          Yeah, very click-baity.

                    MICHAELANGELO
          I'd definitely give that a read.

                    RAPHAEL
          I have so many regrets!

                    MICHAELANGELO
          I wish I could tried frozen yogurt!

                    LEONARDO
          You could have!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I know! And I blew it!

                    DONATELLO
          I just wish I could see BTS IRL.

                    LEONARDO
          We could uh...

                    RAPHAEL
          I guess we could sing.

                    LEONARDO
          We could do some of the songs for
          you.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yeah I'm down.

                    DONATELLO
          Really? That would be great.
                                                                80.


                          LEONARDO
                    (singing)
                Smooth like butter...come on guys.

      THEY ALL SING "BUTTER" by BTS TO DONNIE.

                          DONATELLO
                You guys don't even know the words.

      And then... THE LIGHTS ALL GO OUT in the ROOM!! All the
      GUARDS OUTSIDE THE CELL take a DEFENSIVE POSE.


      INT. TCRI - UTROM'S OFFICE -CONTINUOUS

690   Utrom sees an alarm go off. TCRI Guard rushes in the room.
                                                               690

      (MAKE SURE UTROM IS NOT SCARED AND USHERED AWAY, BUT THAT SHE
      IS A SCARY BOSS WALKING OFF WITH CONFIDENCE)

                          CYNTHIA UTROM
                What? What's happening?

                          TCRI GUARD
                We have a breach.

                          CYNTHIA UTROM
                Why did the milking stop?!

                          TCRI GUARD
                Moving Ms. Utrom to a secure
                location.

                          SPIDER
                Someone's here.


      INT. TCRI MILKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The guards search around for the unseen intruder. Splinter
      FALLS FROM THE AIR VENTS!

                          SPLINTER
                Boys!!!

                          TURTLES
                DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                           SPLINTER
                Stay back everyone! Stay back! I'm
                just here for my boys, who lied to
                me! They are in so much trouble
                right now!
                                                           81.


                    TCRI GUARD
          Oh is that so, Ratatouille? Grab
          another machine and hook him up
          like the others.

                    SPLINTER
          Don't call me Ratatouille.

It's an UNBELIEVABLE DISPLAY of ninja skills!! He kicks the
living shit out of all the guards in the room!! It's insane.

                    TURTLES
          WOAHHH!!!!!!

                      GUARDS
          Uhhhh?

          Go go go!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Yeah! Kick his butt dad!

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah get him dad!

                    TCRI GUARD
          Where you gonna run to rat?

EVEN MORE GUARDS SHOW UP - Splinter has to genuinely FIGHT
FOR HIS LIFE. He uses the objects in the lab and the
environment itself.

A guard SHOCKS HIM and another THROWS HIM against a storage
locker which FALLS DIRECTLY ON TOP OF HIM.

The Turtles GASP.

Then-- a SWORD rips through the side of the locker. Splinter
emerges dawning ALL OF THE TURTLES' DIFFERENT WEAPONS!

He uses them to finish off the guards, who don't stand a
chance. Finally, he's victorious.

He HITS the control panel and RELEASES the turtles.

                      TURTLES
          Dad!!!

                    SPLINTER
          Boys! Are you okay?!??!

                    TURTLES
          Yes!/We're good!/Thank god!/We're
          more than okay.

                    LEONARDO
          How did you find us?!!

April COMES IN THROUGH a vent!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Listen, I'd be a pretty big piece
          of crap if I didn't at least try to
          get your dad to come help you.

                     LEONARDO
          April!!!

                    DONATELLO
          Did not see that coming!

                    SPLINTER
          This human told me you lied to me.
          What happened?! What have you been
          doing?!

                    TURTLES
          Nothing./Ah.../It's...

                    SPLINTER
          Wait a minute. What is this
          machine?

                    TURTLES
          Uhhh, this machine? Nothing./It's
          nothing.

                    SPLINTER
          Does that say milking machine?!?

                    TURTLES
          No! / It's the opposite of that!/
          Does it?

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          ...it's a milking machine.

                    SPLINTER
          See! I told you they'd milk you!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Now I actually might puke.
                                                          83.


                    SPLINTER
          Boys you left the sewer and got
          milked! You helped some evil fly
          man create a machine that is gonna
          destroy the world, and kill the
          only good human, April. So we're
          going to clean up your mess then go
          home and stay there forever, ok?

                    LEONARDO
          What about April's story?

                    SPLINTER
          Forget the story! April, go home!
          It's over! Ok?

                    TURTLES
          Okay./We get it./Alright./Fine Dad.

                    SPLINTER
          There's only one way for you to be
          safe and happy, and that's LISTEN
          TO ME! Let's go.


SEQ.1855 - ONE LAST MISSION


EXT. TCRI - MOMENTS LATER

They leave the building - April goes one way, the turtles and
Splinter go the other.

                    LEONARDO
          Sorry we couldn't help you get Prom
          un-cancelled.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Nah, it's alright. Seeing you guys
          make so many mistakes just to get
          people to like you made me realize
          I was definitely doing this for the
          wrong reason.

April walks over to her scooter, which has a flat tire.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Oh, perfect.

More guards arrive at TCRI on motorcycles. They run inside.

                    TCRI GUARD
          Backup arriving now! Sealing off

The turtles and splinter DROP into the ship, READY FOR
ACTION. But to their surprise - there's NOBODY AROUND.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Maybe they decided to just like,
          give up and go bowling again?

          Sorry, did what now?

                    SPLINTER
          As much as I don't like them, and
          trust me, I do NOT like them - if
          we kill them, we are no better than
          they are!

          I REFUSE to accept that you all are

          No! That's not true!

                    MICHELANGELO
          We accept you!

This lands with the mutants.

          Yes! Plenty of room!

The mutants all look to each other.

                    WINGNUT
          Yeah it's a good point. I'd rather
          not murder tons of people, cus
          like, what if I'm haunted by the

Mondo cowers for a brief fearful moment, then rallies his
courage. He throws down his crowbar.

                    MONDO GECKO
          Uh, no, we don't wanna do this! And
          really, I don't think we ever did!
          We just didn't know there was any
          alternative, but now that we met
          these dudes we see that... there
          IS! So let's just stop and vibe!

The mutants nod in agreement.

                    WINGNUT
          Give me a V a V, a vibe!

                    SUPERFLY
          Nah man I don't vibe. And you don't
          either. Now GET IN LINE!

                    BEBOP
          Seriously Supe...
                                                          87.


                    ROCKSTEADY
          Turn off the machine.

Superfly stares at his mutant crew, filling with anger.

                    SUPERFLY
          My own family. Turned against me.
          After everything I done for
          ya'll...
              (stone cold)
          Look, bottom line: if you wanna
          stop this machine, you've got to go
          through me.

Superfly presses buttons on the machine, powering it up and
pointing it at downtown Manhattan.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          This guy's making me angry.

                    BEBOP
          I think this guy's been making me
          angry my whole LIFE!

                    ROCKSTEADY
          Oh my gosh...
              (realizing)
          I think he's the REASON we're
          angry!

                    BEBOP
          We gonna do something bout it!?!

                      ROCKSTEADY
          Ahhh!

Rocksteady charges!

                      WINGNUT
          Yeah!

                    BEBOP
          Yeah get him Rock!

Superfly grabs Rocksteady and tosses him.

                      SUPERFLY
          Gotcha!

                      BEBOP
          Rock! No!

                    GENGHIS FROG
          You're trash!
                                                        88.


                    SUPERFLY
          Come on! Oink oink, punk!

                    BEBOP
          Not my nose ring! No!

Genghis shoots his tongue onto Superfly's face, flying at
him.

Wingnut flies at the machine, trying to disable it. Superfly
grabs her.

                    WINGNUT
          Ah the machine! This is our chance
          come on! Ah!

Superfly flies up and attacks. She grabs him-

                    SUPERFLY
          Get off me!

-and he sends her flying!

Leatherhead SNAPS at Superfly who narrowly dodges it. Ray
Fillet swoops in behind.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          Oh no! Funky breath!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Flying kick!

                    RAY FILLET
          Ray Fillet!

The mutants tackle Superfly to the ground. He shakes them off
and gets back up.

Leo and Donnie rush towards the machine.

                     LEONARDO
          We gotta break it! Just like, I
          dunno, throw it against the wall or
          something!

                    DONATELLO
          Try to rip it out! Get it get it!

Superfly grabs Michelangelo and hits him repeatedly.

                    SUPERFLY
          Surprise! Why you socking yourself?
          Why you socking yourself?
                                                           89.


                    WINGNUT
          Am I actually helping, anyone?

                    SUPERFLY
          You might as well give up! Watch
          out!

Superfly beats down Ray Fillet.

                    RAY FILLET
          Rayyy Filletttt...

                    SUPERFLY
          They smile in your face, all the
          time they wanna take your place.

The group rallies and charges at him! The mutants all WRESTLE
Superfly. THEY START TO SUBDUE HIM!

Splinter PICKS HIMSELF UP. Superfly sees him.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          What's goin on? Why are you all
          doing this?! There's only one way
          for you to feel safe and happy,
          that's if you listen to me!

This triggers Splinter.

                    SUPERFLY (CONT'D)
          Rat man! Come on, help me out! Look
          man, we're basically the same! We
          both hate humans! I'm just not a
          punk about it like you!

                    SPLINTER
          Don't you say that!

He CHARGES SUPERFLY!! HE HITS THE MACHINE. The machine starts
to CRASH through the freighter!

They all watch as the machine and Superfly sink into the
ocean...

                    LEONARDO
          Geez dad, you really went buck wild
          there.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Uh, did we stop it?

                    SPLINTER
          I think so?
                                                           90.


BUT - the MACHINE that was dumped in the WATER starts to
RUMBLE from deep under the ocean.

                    MONDO GECKO
          Hey when a machine that turns a
          bunch of animals into mutants goes
          off underwater, um, and then
          there's animals in the water, um
          like what do you think that does?

The water GLOWS GREEN.


SEQ.2040 - TERROR OF THE MEGAMUTANT


EXT. SUPERFLY'S LAB - MOMENTS LATER

The mutants get to the top of the freighter and watch as a
DISTURBANCE in the WATER heads towards MANHATTAN.

A HUGE MONSTER EMERGES FROM THE WATER.

                    MICHELANGELO
          It's ok, things flop onto the shore
          all the time!

                    LEONARDO
          That's not so bad!

THEN STEPS INTO THE ZOO, GAINING LEGS AND ARMS.

                    TURTLES/MUTANTS
          Oh my god!/Yeah that's
          bad!/AH!/That got way worse!

It ROARS, emerging from the zoo.

                      SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Oh HELLLL YEAHHHHHH!!!! LOOK AT ME.
          Look at me! This is amazing! I
          ain't just Superfly. I'm SUPERDUPER
          FLY! You know what I mean? I mean

          that a... is that a whale tail? Aww.
          I got a claw, I got a whale body,
          giraffe forehead...Look at my
          feets! They're made of horses! Man
          I'm about to have a BALL with this.
          Thank you turtles!!!! Thank you, ya
          lil' tortoises.
              (ROARING)
          NEW YORK! Here I COME!
                                                 91.


He starts flying into downtown Manhattan.


EXT. STATEN ISLAND BOAT GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS

Agape, the turtles watch the mutant from afar.

                    RAPHAEL
          Alright, well... we gave it a shot.
          Back to the sewer? I got pizza
          tonight for dinner....

                      LEONARDO
          Really?!

                    DONATELLO
          We can't stop that thing! We
          couldn't stop him before he became
          that thing!

                    LEONARDO
          What, so we just go home?

                    MICHELANGELO
          I bet the army will be here soon!

                    DONATELLO
          According to every Godzilla movie,
          they'll eventually get here.

                    WINGNUT
          So, you guys got like a good Wi-Fi
          situation down there? Like are you
          fully able to stream or uh?

                        SPLINTER
          NO!!!!

They all turn to Splinter.

                    WINGNUT
          Oh okay, no streaming-

                      SPLINTER
          Not that!

He faces the turtles.

                    SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          Boys - I messed up. I don't want to
          be like Superfly. I love you boys.
          I want you to be happy.
                    (MORE)
                                                       92.

                     SPLINTER (CONT'D)
          Even though I don't like humans, I
          want them to like you because YOU
          want them to like you. (beat) So
          we're gonna get that monster. We're
          gonna take him down. We're gonna
          film it and we're gonna show it to
          the world. And the world will love
          you and accept you! And the world
          will cheer turtles turtles
          turtles!!!

The turtles are deeply moved by Splinter's words.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          Oh man, I'm feeling GREAT after
          that speech right?

                    BEBOP
          It was rousing. I'm fully roused,
          ya know?

                    ROCKSTEADY
          Little bit of a buzzkill here but-

                    BEBOP / ROCKSTEADY
          How do we do that??

Donnie's phone rings. It's April.

                    DONATELLO
          Hello?

                    APRIL O'NEIL (O.S.)
          Hey! What am I looking at? What
          happened to the whole "stop
          Superfly" thing? We not doing that
          or what's up?

April can see Superfly: Mega Mutant from her window.

                    DONATELLO
          SO much has changed since we last
          spoke.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (O.S.)
          Yeah obviously.

He hands the phone to Leo.

                    LEONARDO
          It's a lot to catch up on, okay?
          But first, do you mayyyyyyyybeeeee
          know any ways we might be able to
          stop that thing?
                                                           93.


SEQ.2041 - APRIL FINDS THE MUTAGEN GUN


INT. APRIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

April looks at the TCRI motorcycle in her driveway equipped
with an anti-mutant gun.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Oh, I actually might have
          something...Meet me at the leg
          of... the thing we're all looking
          at...right? Cool.

QUICK CUTS - THE MOTORCYCLE's engine getting REVVED, throttle
getting TURNED, WHEELS SCREECHING - APRIL RIPS down the road
on the bike with the ANTI-MUTAGEN GUN in tow.

Leo hangs up the phone.

                    LEONARDO
          Let's GO!!!

SCUMBUG SPREADS HER GIANT BEAUTIFUL WINGS!!!!!


EXT. EAST RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

IN A GLORIOUS SHOT - WE SEE Wingnut carrying Bebop and
Rocksteady, one in each hand. Scumbug, flying with a CARGO
NET that holds Splinter and the Turtles. Leatherhead swims
next to Ray Fillet, who Mondo Gecko surfs on. Genghis Frog
HOPS out of the water periodically as he keeps up!

WE SEE the turtles all smooshed together in the cargo net.

                    RAPHAEL
          This is not triumphant at all.

Some Scumbug goop DRIPS on to Donnie.

                    DONATELLO
          Ahh!! It hit my lip!


EXT. MANHATTAN - MOMENTS LATER

The MUTANT crew LAND in the city and SPRING into action.
                                                           94.


They turn to see APRIL on the motorcycle RIPPING TOWARDS
THEM! She AKIRA SLIDES to a STOP right in front of them.

She tosses the ANTIDOTE GUN to RAPH and RUN towards Superfly:
Mega Mutant!!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          New York, New York! I'm here baby!
          Ya'll thought it was gonna be
          Godzilla? Nah!

Raph gets into position.

                    RAPHAEL
          Woo ok let's go, eye of the tiger,
          come on. You got this Raph. You're
          awesome.

The others encourage him and give him pointers.

                    MICHAELANGELO
          Close one eye, I heard that helps.

                       RAPHAEL
          Shut. Up.

                    LEATHERHEAD
          Steady, steady.

                    SPLINTER
          Focus! Breathe deep!

                    RAPHAEL
          Don't screw this up.

                    TURTLES AND MUTANTS
          [misc words of encouragement]

He takes the shot and it hits Superfly: Mega Mutant!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          What the hell?

                    LEONARDO
          Is that it did you do it?

                    RAPHAEL
          I think I got it.

                       DONATELLO
          We did it!

                       SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Ahhhh!
                                                          95.


                    RAPHAEL
          We're good right?

ONE horse falls off of Superfly: Mega Mutant and runs away.

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          That's it? One little horse? I
          don't need that horse.

Superfly: Mega Mutant TURNS AROUND and sees our crew.

                    LEONARDO
          That didn't do what I thought it
          would.

                    RAPHAEL
          Oh my god it's running at us. Oh my
          god! Oh my god! Leo do something!

                    LEONARDO
          Run run run!

He KICKS a bus and it FLIES at them. They DIVE for cover as
it SMASHES down, EXPLODING!!!


SEQ.4000 - WARZONE

WE SEE MIKEY'S EYES OPEN - it's like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The
street is like a WAR ZONE.

                    WINGNUT
          This isn't going very good!

                    SUPERFDUPERFLY
          What did the claw say to the face?
          Smack!

Wingnut FLIES and is SWATTED out of the sky.

Bebop tries to free Rocksteady from underneath an ambulance.

                    BEBOP
          Rocksteady! Buddy are you okay?

Mikey sees mondo's TAIL under some rubble.

                     MICHELANGELO
          Mondo!

He pulls at it and is horrified to see its JUST A TAIL!

                     MICHELANGELO (CONT'D)
          AHH!
                                                        96.


MONDO runs by in the BG.

                    MONDO GECKO
          It's ok! It grows back! See?

WE SEE it SPROUT back!

                     DONATELLO (O.S.)
          Mikey!!!

Mikey turns to see Donnie stumbling his way!

                     RAPHAEL
          Donnie!

Superfly: Mega Mutant HURLS a car a Donnie. RAPH appears,
SHOVING Donnie out of the way, just in time. CRASH!

                    DONATELLO
          Thanks bro.

                    MICHELANGELO
          Where are the others!

                    RAPHAEL
          I don't know!

                    DONATELLO
          Where's dad? Where's April?

Another CAR is thrown at them! It crashes in front of Leo as
he LEAPS out of the way, landing with his brothers!

                    LEONARDO
          He's gonna run out of cars
          eventually!

Superfly: Mega Mutant turns to a full CAR GARAGE right next
to him.

                    LEONARDO (CONT'D)
          Oh come on!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          You like these rides right here?

They all RUN!!

                    DONATELLO
          Oh the Mercedes E class, no!

                    RAPHAEL
          That one's a Prius, it's okay.
                                                           97.


                      LEONARDO
            Look out! A tesla! Somebody's mad
            about that.

They jump into a BUS to hide-

                      LEONARDO (CONT'D)
            I think we lost him-

-but Superfly: Mega Mutant KICKS the BUS! They go flying
through the air and land in Times Square!

                      RAPHAEL
            Ouch.

                      SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
            Uhhhh! Hit that from the back!

SEQ.4050 - THE TURTLES RALLY

The turtles LAND - DAZED.

They pull themselves out of the bus... to see EVERYONE
HORRIFIED of them. ALL THE SCREENS in the city have various
news outlets reporting on the mutant attack. "MUTANTS ATTACK
NEW YORK: MUTANT MAYHEM!!"

                      LEONARDO
            You good guys? (looks up) Oh no.

On one screen:

                      SCIENTIST
            Monstrous mutants are rampaging
            through downtown New York! The only
            question is do we capture them for
            experimentation, or kill them on
            site? Taking calls now!

On ANOTHER SCREEN -

                      FEMALE ANCHOR
            If you're just joining us, mutants
            are attacking the city.

On ANOTHER SCREEN -

                      ANCHOR
            A rash of monsters in New York is
            taking over Times Square.

ANOTHER -
                                                        98.


                    MILITARY GENERAL
          We don't know what they are but
          there WILL be a military response.

OTHERS-

                    ANCHOR
          -are threatening to take a bite out
          of the Big Apple.

                    ANCHOR (CONT'D)
          -widespread destruction and chaos!

                     CITIZEN
          One thing I know? I hate mutants!

                    CITIZENS
          We hate mutants! We hate mutants!

A scared MOTHER ushers her DAUGHTER away from the turtles.

                    MOTHER
          Ah! It's them!

                    DONATELLO
          Yeah, I don't think this is gonna
          go down how we wanted it to...

                    MICHELANGELO
          They hate us...

                    RAPHAEL
          They think we're villains.

                    DONATELLO
          No, worse. They think we're
          monsters.

                    RAPHAEL
          We're never gonna be normal.

                    LEONARDO
          Look, guys, April was right. We
          were doing this for the wrong
          reasons. I know we only wanted to
          be heroes to be accepted, but even
          though it looks like we'll never be
          accepted...I still think we should
          try to be heroes.

                    MICHELANGELO
          But how? Every plan we've had has
          failed.
                                                       99.


                    LEONARDO
          Plan?! YOU'RE complaining we don't
          have a plan?! Mikey - What do you
          do better than ANYONE? Even Mark
          Ruffalo?

                    MICHAELANGELO
          ... IMPROVISE!!!

                    DONATELLO
          It's impossible!

                    LEONARDO
          Says the guy who has read more
          comics where people are fighting
          giant monsters than anyone on
          EARTH!

                    DONATELLO
          I mean I have but...

                    LEONARDO
          You MUST be able to think of a way
          to stop something like that!

Donnie looks around, thinking. WE PUSH IN ON HIM.

                    DONATELLO
          Of COURSE! Attack on Titan! Giant
          monsters attack and they have ONE
          WEAKNESS! On the backs of their
          necks!

                    MICHAELANGELO
          Yes! And, the blowhole is exactly
          that!!

                       DONATELLO
          That's it!

He picks up the LAST VIAL of anti-ooze from the gun.

                    DONATELLO (CONT'D)
          If we can get THIS thing into that
          thing's blowhole, it'll go in it's
          bloodstream! I bet it'll demutanize
          it!

                    LEONARDO
          There ya go! Demutanize the big
          monster! And Raph... It's time to
          go loud.
                                                        100.


                    RAPHAEL
          Loud?

                    LEONARDO
          REAL LOUD! As loud as you've ever
          gone. Use that rage of yours! Use
          it to help us!!!

                    RAPHAEL
          Okay I will! RAHHH!!

Raph sees a PIZZA VAN on it's side. He goes over and LIFTS
IT, PUTTING IT ON IT'S WHEELS!!!!!

                    TURTLES
          YEAHHH!!!!!!

                    MICHELANGELO
          We gotta get you into therapy man!

They pile in. Raph looks to Leo.

                    RAPHAEL
          Ya know, just then, for the first
          time in your life, you didn't sound
          lame! You actually sounded like a
          leader.

                    LEONARDO
          I do! Oh I do! Oh I sound like such
          a leader, holy crap that's so dope!

                    RAPHAEL
          And you ruined it.

                    DONATELLO
          Let's DO THIS!!


EXT. NY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

They DRIVE towards SUPER DUPER FLY!

THEY SPEED PAST A PILE of RUBBLE and we see APRIL emerge!

                    APRIL
          Dear lord this helmet was a good
          investment!

She looks up at the nearest JUMBO SCREEN and sees the
headlines about how the TURTLES are VILLAINS.

                    APRIL (CONT'D)
          Not on my watch!
                                                       101.


She sees the screen is attached to the ACTUAL NEWS BUILDING.
She RUNS TOWARDS IT.


SEQ.4100 - CHANNEL 6 NEWS


INT. NEWS BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

April makes her way through the building as we see Superfly:
Mega Mutant wreaking havoc out the windows.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Ok, not great. Not great at all.
          No, very bad. Yeah.


INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

We see an ANCHOR at the news desk, reporting.

                    ANCHOR
          If you're just joining us, an army
          of mutants that appears to be lead
          by four turtle men is attacking the
          city with a giant whale monster.

A LIGHT FALLS.

                    ANCHOR (CONT'D)
          AHHH!!!

The ANCHOR runs away! The CAMERA GUYS look at each other,
when APRIL BURSTS in and heads for the desk.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Keep rolling!!!! I got the REAL
          story!!!

April PLOPS down behind the desk.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          April O'Neil here and...

She looks at the LIGHTS and CAMERAS. HER HEART STARTS TO
BEAT. She starts to SWEAT! The camera guys POINT TO HER!
She's ON!!! The tension BUILDS AND BUILDS... until - April
CLEARS HER THROAT and looks DEAD IN THE CAMERA.
                                                       102.


                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)

          April O'Neil here reporting live
          with new and CONFIRMED information -
          A fly-monster is attacking the
          city, but the turtle teens, along
          with the rat, warthog, stingray,
          crocodile, bat, frog, lizard and
          cockroach lady are in fact fighting
          AGAINST the monster in an attempt
          to SAVE New York! The giant monster
          is bad, but the mutants you see
          here are in fact GOOD!

April PUKES EVERYWHERE!!!!!!

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          Sorry I really thought I got past
          that, that's a thing from my past.
          Anyway, as I was saying...


SEQ.4200 - BATTLE SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT


EXT. NY - CONTINUOUS

The VAN speeds through the streets towards Superfly: Mega
Mutant! Scumbug flies up holding Splinter.

                    SCUMBUG
          GRABBLABBBLE!!!

                    SPLINTER
          GRABBLABBBLE!!!

Scumbug drops Splinter onto the van.

                    LEONARDO
          Whoah dad, you speak the same
          language as Scumbug?

                    SPLINTER
          We actually have a lot in common!
          I'm really attracted to her!!

                    LEONARDO
          Oh that's gross.

                    SPLINTER
          Donnie! You should NOT be driving!

                       DONATELLO
          Sorry dad!
                                                          103.


                    SPLINTER
          But since you are - go there!

He points a HUGE parking structure with SPIRAL RAMP going up
20 stories.

Superfly: Mega Mutant is SMASHING a building - oblivious!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          I'm the king of New York!

They TURN ON TO THE RAMP AND SPEED IN CIRCLES!

                    MICHELANGELO
          Woo! That slide!

They FLY OFF THE RAMP and SOAR towards Superfly: Mega Mutant -
his BLOWHOLE in site -

                    MICHELANGELO (CONT'D)
          COWWAAABBUUUNNNGGGAAA!!!!!

                      TURTLES
          AHHHH!!!!

                      SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Gotcha!

He GRABS them in his CLAW! They DROP the vial and SPLINTER
GRABS it as he LEAPS through the air from the van - but
Superfly: Mega Mutant SWATS HIM - HE SOARS THROUGH THE AIR -
CRASHING in TIMES SQUARE!

                      TURTLES
          DAD!!!!

Superfly: Mega Mutant looks to the turtles in his claw.

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          That's it! You're done. It's over.
          You are never gonna stop me! And
          humans are never gonna like you!
          Because HUMANS SUCK!

HE STARTS TO CRUSH THEM! THEM SCREAM IN AGONY!!!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT (CONT'D)
          These shells are hard! I'm about to
          snap you like a pistachio.

Their SHELLS BEGIN TO CRACK A BIT!
                                                       104.


                     TURTLES
          AHHH!!

                    RAPHAEL
          Look, I know I said your faces
          weren't the last thing I wanted to
          see before I died! But now that
          we're actually about to die...
          there's nothing I'd rather be
          looking at!

                    LEONARDO
          That was so heartfelt Raph!

                    MICHELANGELO
          I'm crying.

                    DONATELLO
          Love you bro.


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

We see SPLINTER in a HEAP. He tries to get up but his LEG IS
MANGLED! He has the vial of OOZE, but it's CRACKED on the
ground beside him! He goes to GRAB it but CAN'T TOUCH IT!

HE SEES THE TURTLES getting CRUSHED by Superfly: Mega Mutant!

                     SPLINTER

                     SPLINTER
          No! No!

But then - he sees - the human is EXTENDING HIS HAND TO HELP!

                    ADULT HUMAN NINJA HELPER
          Hey, are you okay? Do you need
          help?

                    HUMAN 2

                                                       105.

                    HUMAN 3
          We'll go to a hospital or a
          veterinarian.

                    SPLINTER
          No no. I must get this to my boys!

A human puts the LEAKING VIAL in a THANK YOU plastic bag.

                    ADULT HUMAN NINJA HELPER
          I got this!

BACK ON THE TURTS -

                    RAPHAEL
          Hey the humans! They're helping us!

                       LEONARDO
          Really?!

                       DONATELLO
          Yes! Haha!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Oh no they AIN'T!!

Superfly: Mega Mutant flings a car at him!

There's a GAP in the road - the guy can't make it!

Genghis Frog appears!

                    GENGHIS FROG
          Hop on! Let's go!

The guy GETS ON AND Genghis HOPS over the gap!

                       ADULT HUMAN NINJA HELPER
          Woah!

                    GENGHIS FROG
          Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!
                                                         106.


He's hopping until there's an EXPLOSION - the vial is KNOCKED
free and sails through the air - until a CABBY catches it!

                    CABBIE FROM THE BRONX
          Hey! I'm a cabbie from the Bronx!
          How bout that!

                    ADULT HUMAN NINJA HELPER
          Get that to the monster!

The cabby SPEEDS towards the monster - until RUBBLE falls in
the road right in front of him! He's about to crash when
SCUMBUG AND WINGNUT BOTH appear and LIFT the CAB in to the
air!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          What the hell?

                    WINGNUT
          I'm being helpful! Wow I'm strong!

                    SCUMBUG
          Blagahghagh!

Superfly: Mega Mutant HURLS a statue at them.

Wingnut and Scumbug DROP the cab and Bebop and Rocksteady
catch it!!!

                    BEBOP
          Gotcha!

They set it down and help out the woozy driver.

                    CABBIE FROM THE BRONX
          Someone take this bag please!

                    MONDO GECKO
          Hey human! Got it from here bro!

Mondo takes the bag and expertly skates through the debris
field.

Superfly: Mega Mutant hurls radio antennae at him like
javelins!

                     SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          I'm gonna mess you up right here,
          right now!

More young New York skaters show up and they pass it back and
forth.
                                                         107.


                    SKATER
          Don't worry, I gotcha.

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Dang Mondo, you slippery lizard!

They get to a sinkhole in the road flooding with water. Ray
Fillet grabs the vile and swims it across!

                    RAY FILLET
          YAY FILLET!

He tosses it to a construction worker who jumps on the hook
of a crane. The crane operator hoists him in the air.

                    CONSTRUCTION WORKER
          I got it!
              (to Turtles)
          Hey! I heard you need this!

Another construction worker smacks Superfly: Mega Mutant in
the heel with a backhoe!

                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          AHHHH! OW! MAN DAMN! STOP! THE
          HELL? AH!

The turtles SEIZE the opportunity to WRIGGLE out of Superfly:
Mega Mutant's claw!

People and mutants attack Superfly: Mega Mutant from all
sides at once! They crash cars into his feet! Smack him with
cranes!

People TOSS everything they can out of their apartment
windows, raining debris down on Superfly: Mega Mutant.

                    RAPHAEL
          Throw it over!

The construction worker tosses the turtles the vial.

He catches it.

                    RAPHAEL (CONT'D)
          Got it! Mikey catch!

                    MICHAELANGELO
          Coming in hot!

He tosses it to Donnie who RUNS through a high-rise as
Superfly: Mega Mutant swings his claw at him.
                                                          108.


                    SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Ya'll done screwed up now!

                    DONATELLO

Donnie tosses it back to Raph.

                    RAPHAEL
          Leo!

Superfly: Mega Mutant is too distracted to stop them!!

                    LEONARDO
          Got it!

LEO jumps in the air, vial in hand-

Leo DUNKS the vial into Superfly: Mega Mutant's blowhole.

The turtles land on Superfly: Mega Mutant in formation.

                     SUPERFLY: MEGA MUTANT
          Wah!! Damn!! Oh, you think this the
          end of me?

          Man, you know what-

THE MONSTER BEGINS TO DE-MUTANTGANIZE!!

Rays of blue light SHOOT OUT between the fish composing
Superfly: Mega Mutant's body!

He EXPLODES! The various animals composing him fall safely to
the ground, along with the turtles.

People see it's safe to come out and flood the streets.
EVERYONE is cheering for the turtles!

                    RAPHAEL

          Hey, them toitles are alright!

                    RANDOM MOTHER

A nearby reporter covers the story.

                    NEWS ANCHOR
              (on screen)
          Again, we're reporting live with
          footage of the mutant hero turtles
          who saved New York...

The turtles look at each other. This is everything they ever
wanted.

                    NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
          In a story broken by April- wait,
          what's your name?

April grabs the microphone from the reporter.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          April O'Neil. That's April O'
          apostrophe Neil, Not Puke Girl. And
          if you ever call me Puke Girl, bite
          me! Cus I did it! Yeah! Woo!

Bebop, Rocksteady and the other mutants emerge from the
rubble. They're all okay!

                    SPLINTER
          You know, it's hard to meet other
          mutants my age.

Scumbug GRABS Splinter and MAKES OUT WITH HIM!


SEQ.4600 - FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

                                                       110.


Mondo Gecko is SKATEBOARDING in a pipe while Genghis films
it.

                    MONDO GECKO
          Can't wait to add that to my
          footy!!

Splinter and Scumbug hurry to pack the turtles' lunches.

Wingnut is going through Donnie's manga collection.

                    WINGNUT
          The entire Akira original set!
          Don't mind if I do!!

Bebop and Rocksteady move a couch.

                    ROCKSTEADY
          The couch should go here!

                    BEBOP
          I pictured the couch against the
          wall!

                    ROCKSTEADY
          That's so basic!

                    BEBOP
          Hey that's not basic!

They start to WRESTLE. LEATHERHEAD puts out a bloomin' onion.

                    LEATHERHEAD
          `Ey mates, Bloomin' Onion, coming
          right up.

Genghis EATS it with his tongue.

                    GENGHIS FROG
          Mmm, that is outstanding!

                    SPLINTER

          scared, there are sewers ALL over
          the city! Just hop into the sewer!
          You can come home anytime! And if
          anyone messes with you, call me! I
          will come kick their butts! Hoo-ha!

                    SCUMBUG
          GHAAHHAHAADLDLDLADAAA!
                                                       111.


                    SPLINTER
          And she will eat what's left!

                    LEONARDO
          We'll be fine dad.

                    RAPHAEL
          Yeah... don't worry. We're ready
          for this.

                    MICHELANGELO
          We've BEEN ready!

                    DONATELLO
          Trust us, you've prepared us for
          this.

                     SPLINTER
          Alright.
              (beat)
          I'm proud of you boys. I love you.

                    DONATELLO
          We love you.

                    SPLINTER
          Love you too!
              (to Scumbug)
          And I love you too, sweetie!

                    SCUMBUG
          BLA GA RAH!

                    TURTLES
          Ugh./Dad!/That's gross!

Mikey climbs up the ladder after his brothers.

                    SPLINTER
          Now go show those humans how cool
          you are.

He drops his ORANGE FACE MASK which Splinter catches below.

EXT. EASTMAN HIGH - DAY

The turtles approach the school on their first day.


INT. EASTMAN HIGH - CONTINUOUS

The turtles enter the school. We see PROM IS BACK! Posters
around the hallway.
                                                       112.


Kids look at the turtles - then CHEER!! They come around and
start to TALK TO THEM - welcoming them to the school.

                    KIDS
          Yo!/ It's the turtles!/I'm so glad
          you're here!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Guys! I'm so happy you made it, let
          me show you around!

They walk down the hallways, past April's locker. "Puke Girl"
has been replaced with "April O'Hero."

END CREDITS

WE SEE CELL PHONE FOOTAGE of the turtles filming themselves
on their first day of school.

                    DONATELLO

          have found my people! Haha!

WE SEE a group of kids hanging out on the steps with
computers, playing video games.

CELL PHONE FOOTAGE of RAPH and some JOCKS practicing

                                                       113.

                    APRIL O'NEIL (CONT'D)
          (to Leo) Leo how many times-
          landscape! Landscape!

                    LEONARDO
          Oh, yep sorry my bad.

He turns the camera.

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          WHO IS TCRI!?! The shady black ops
          organization behind the mutants!
          Their offices, ABANDONED after the
          mutant attack. Gone without a
          trace!

                    LEONARDO
          But... WE will FIND THEM!!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Yeah that's right.

                    LEONARDO
          Yeah we will.

HE PUTS THE PHONE DOWN. WE go to normal movie.

                     LEONARDO (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Uh... hey April... Now that Prom is

          there.

                    LEONARDO
          I almost did.


SEQ.4700 - GET ME THE SHREDDER

CUT TO PROM! It's LOVELY AND WONDERFUL.

They're having a BLAST, hanging with humans, loving that life
baby!

                    APRIL O'NEIL
          Wait, this is as friends right?

                       LEONARDO
          What?
                                                       114.


Mikey dances, the others cheering him on.

WE PULL UP AND AWAY from them watching the movie. The camera
getting HIGHER AND HIGHER... WE REVEAL WE ARE SEEING
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE of the scene.

WE pull back to see CYNTHIA UTROM at NEW TCRI - WATCHING THE
TURTLES. A familiar looking FLY moves around in a container
next to her.

                     CYNTHIA UTROM
           Well... it appears as though
           finding these creatures will be
           easier than I thought. CAPTURING
           them on the other hand... might
           prove difficult.

                     SPIDER
           There is one option.

                     CYNTHIA UTROM
           Yes. I know.


EXT. NEW YORK - ELSEWHERE

OVERLOOKING THE CITY IS AN IMPOSING SILHOUETTE.

                     CYNTHIA UTROM (V.O.)
           Bring me... THE SHREDDER!!
