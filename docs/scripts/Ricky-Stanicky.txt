TITLE CARD: "1990"


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Halloween night. Trick or treating is long over. The only
kids still out are the trouble makers. Here are three of
them, walking through the woods, still in costume. TED 10,
is Maverick from Top Gun. JT, 10, is Freddie Kruger and WES,
10, is a dog. Ted and JT wear jackets over their costumes.
Ted carries a paper bag of dog poo and a lighter.

                     JT
               (to Wes)
           A dog? That's your costume?     Lame.

                     WES
           Not just a dog. A dog with a
           boner. Check it out.

He points down to his crotch where he has attached a
retractable red sharpie. He pushes the button and the red
tip comes out.

                      TED
           Shh!   This is the place.

Ted indicates a house.


EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Lights in the windows and the SOUND of a television. Ted
places the bag on the porch and lights it. JT presses the
doorbell. They dash off into the bushes, barely able to
contain themselves.

A BEAT.   No one answers.

Ted runs up and rings the bell again.     Still no answer.   The
fire in the bag grows.

                     WES
           That fire is kinda big.     Should we
           put it out?

                    TED
           Nah. The guy will answer in a
           second.

A gust of wind lifts the flaming bag into the wooden front
door. It bursts into flames.
  "Ricky Stanicky"         11.13.09         Bushell         2.


                    TED (CONT'D)
          Okay, put it out. Put it out.

They run up to stamp it out but the whole porch is now in
flames.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          Never mind. Run away. Run away.

They run back to the woods.


EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

The boys look back at the fiery house, just a few yards away.

                    WES
          We're so dead.

                    JT
          Oh yeah. We're going to jail and
          the older kids are going to make us
          their bitches.

                    WES
          I'm too young to be a bitch.

                    TED
          Wait. I got an idea.        JT give me
          your jacket.

                    JT
          Use your own shitty jacket. This
          is a North Face. Cost like 200
          dollars.

Ted shows him his name tag is sewn in.

                    TED
          It can't have a name tag. Come on.
          The firemen will be here any
          minute.
              (off JT's resistance)
          Do you want to be someone's bitch?!

Jt takes off his jacket and gives it to Ted.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          Now we need a pen.
              (realizing)
          Wes, your dick!

Wes tries to take the sharpie off his costume's crotch, but
it's stuck.
  "Ricky Stanicky"          11.13.09      Bushell          3.


                    WES
          It's stuck. I can't get it off.

                    TED
          Fine, you write.

He places the Jacket with the tag exposed below Wes.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          We need a common name...

                    WES
          Uh... Ricky.

                    TED
          That's good. Write that.

Wes writes "RICKY" on the tag.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          And a last name. Uh...

Ted looks over at the street sign now illuminated by the
burning house. "STANLEY DRIVE."

                     TED (CONT'D)
          Stan --

                    JT
              (suddenly)
          Stanicky.

                    TED
          Don't write th--

Wes has written it already.

                     WES
          k-y.   Stanicky!

Ted looks at JT like what was that.

                    JT
          It's a common enough name.

SIRENS are starting in the background. Ted grabs the jacket
and runs back to the house. He touches the jacket to the
fire. It burns for a few moments. He then stamps it out and
throws it on the bushes and runs off. We hold on the jacket.
PUSH IN ON THE HANDWRITTEN NAME TAG. "RICKY STANICKY."

PULL OUT ON THE NAME TAG.    A fire CHIEF is lifting the jacket
off the bushes.
  "Ricky Stanicky"          11.13.09      Bushell           4.


EXT. HOUSE - A FEW HOURS LATER

The house is burnt to the ground. Firemen douse some still
smouldering sections. Locals in pajamas and kids still in
costumes mill around, observing. The chief holds up the
jacket to another fireman.

                      CHIEF
           Judging from the size of this
           jacket, we got a junior arsonist on
           our hands.    Kid probably caught
           himself on fire during his prank,
           peeled it off and left it. And
           here's the best part. His mother
           wrote his name in it.

He points to the name tag.

                     FIREMAN #1
           Ricky Stanicky? What kind of name
           is that?

                     CHIEF
           Sounds like a punk to me.   I'll
           call it in to the police.

The chief walks off.    From the woods, the boys look on
amazed.


EXT. ANOTHER STREET - LATER

The boys walk alone.

                     WES
           That was the greatest thing ever.

                     JT
           Yeah, we should use that excuse all
           the time. We could be like, "Ricky
           Stanicky stole my homework. Or
           Ricky Stanicky took the car out."

                     TED
           Are you crazy? It's way too
           dangerous. We're never using that
           name again. Agreed?

A beat.   Wes and JT nod.

                       WES/JT
           Agreed.

                                                    FADE OUT.

"20 YEARS LATER"


INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A well furnished apartment. On one wall is a glass case of
Swarovsky collectible miniatures. ERIN, 28, sets the table
for a dinner party. TED, now 29, enters carrying a few
shopping bags. He drops his blackberry on the table.

                     TED
           I got the wine and the cheese. And
           I slipped the tomato guy an extra
           ten bucks so he'd give me the
           heirloom tomatoes from his secret
           stash. Smell this.

He takes out a gorgeous tomato.    She takes a whiff.

                     ERIN
           My god. I want to fuck that tomato.

She puts it on the cutting board, ready to chop.

                     TED
           Whoa. Maybe we should save this
           baby for later. When we're alone.

She snatches it back, playfully.

                     ERIN
           Ted, I really appreciate this. I
           know you wanted to see the fight
           tonight.

                     TED
           You've been planning this for
           weeks. And your boss is coming.
           Who cares about some silly fight?

Erin kisses Ted. As Ted carries the shopping bags over to
the fridge, his blackberry (still on the table), BUZZES.
Erin looks over at it.

On the screen: A text message reads: CALL ME.       SENDER:
Ricky Stanicky. Erin looks concerned.

                     ERIN
           It's Ricky.

                    TED
          I'll call him later.

                    ERIN
          But Ted, he's been so sick.

                    TED
          Don't worry about Ricky.    He's a
          fighter.

                    ERIN
          But... the cancer. It might have
          come out of remission.

                    TED
          How much damage can cancer do in
          one night? It's more of a long
          excruciating illness.

JT, 20's and SUSAN, 20's enter.   JT carries a small container
of Fleur de Sel.

                    JT
          We got your French salt. Fleur de
          Sel. Shit was expensive.

                    SUSAN
          It wasn't that bad.

                    JT
          Really? Why does salt cost 28
          bucks? Did some French knight
          climb some dragon infested cliff
          and scrape it off with his raper.

                      SUSAN
          Raper?

                      JT
          You know.    It's a French sword.

                    SUSAN
          That's a rapier, JT.    A rapier.

                    JT
          I took French for 6 years, Suze.
          Fleur de Sel. Raper.

                    SUSAN
          You're a moron.

They stop, seeing Erin's concerned look.

          What's wrong?

                    ERIN
          It's Ricky. He texted Ted but Ted
          won't call him back.

                    JT
          Dude. You gotta call him.         What
          about the cancer?

                    TED
          It's cancer okay? Not the cancer.
          Don't make it sound worse than it
          is. It's not like, I don't know,
          swine flu. That shit kills people.

                    ERIN
          So does cancer.

                    TED
          I'll call him but it's going to be
          quick. We've got a dinner party.

Ted picks up the phone and dials.        A beat.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          What's up?... Surgery?...
          Tonight?... they're going to remove
          the testicle?... Oh man...

                       ERIN
          Oh my God.

Ted listens in.

                    TED
              (to Erin)
          He said don't worry.       That's why
          God gave us two.

                   JT
          True. Look at what Lance Armstrong
          did. Biked over the Alps on one
          ball.

Susan looks at JT.

                    SUSAN
          Is it sheer desperation that made
          me marry you?

          Our prayers are with you, brother.
          Tomorrow morning, first thing, I'm
          getting into the car and driving up

          He'll bring the clown nose and do

          I love you too, man.

Ted holds up his arm.     He's wearing a a Livestrong bracelet.

                     TED (CONT'D)
          I'm holding up the bracelet.      You
          know I am.

Ted hangs up.

          You have to go up there tonight.
          He's going in for a major
          operation.

                    TED
          It's just a ball. You can live
          without those. Look at JT.

                     JT
          Dude.

                    ERIN
          I'll come with you. I've never met

          I don't know. I was looking
          forward to that 28 dollar salt.

                    SUSAN

          Ricky is going to appreciate this

Ted gives Erin a kiss.   Ted and JT are halfway out the door
when Ted stops.

JT, Wes and Ted make their way to the bar.     They are still
pumped from the fight.

          I'm buying this round.

Wes takes out his only credit card and is about to hand it to
the bartender when Ted snatches it away.

          Rule number eight of Ricky
          Stanicky, never leave a paper
          trail. Besides you don't even have
          a job.

Ted hands Wes back his credit card.     But Wes pulls out a wad
of scrunched up bills.

                    WES
          That's all about to change. Today
          I had a huge breakthrough. I was
          flipping channels and ended up on
          Sesame Street and suddenly Cookie
          Monster turns to me and says, "Wes,
          me need to talk to you. Me think
          you need to change your life."
          Normally I wouldn't be that
          interested in the advice of a
          talking puppet but it's ten am on a
          Friday, I'm holding a six foot bong
          and I've just eaten a box of cold
          hot pockets. So I'm like, "Me
          think that too. But what should me
          do?" And he's like, "me think you
          need to write a children's book
          about pot." Then he lifts up
          Prairie Dawn, flips open her foam
          scalp and takes a huge bong hit
          from her head.

 "Ricky Stanicky"       11.13.09        Bushell         12.


                    WES
          I know. It's the idea of the
          century. A pot themed kid's book.
          It's going to teach kids about pot
          when they're young so by the time
          they grow up and become our future
          law makers and leaders they can
          legalize it. I'm not talking about
          some "Curious George" picture book
          shit. I'm talking about a
          political movement.

                    TED
          Inspired by cookie monster?

                    WES
          Don't you get it!? This is so much
          bigger than cookie monster.

                    JT
          Wes, what parent would ever buy
          that for their kid?

                    ROD (O.S.)
          I'd buy that book for my kid.

ROD, 30, a very drunk man wearing a pirate costume and an eye
patch sits at the bar in front of an empty glass. He has
about 3000 dollars worth of dead sports book tickets in front
of him. And the remains of a plate of ribs.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Even if it turns out that he's not
          mine. I'm still waiting on the
          test results.

                    TED
          Looks like you got the pirate
          parent audience.

                    ROD
          So let's make a deal. Buy me a
          drink now and I promise to buy your
          book later.

                    TED
          Maybe next time, Captain.

                    ROD
          Wish I was the Captain. I'm Pirate
          #3 from Treasure Island's
          "Fightin' Buccaneers" show. I
          should be Pirate #1. But Milt
          Conrad JR. won't give me a chance.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Stupid directors think they know
          everything.

                    TED
          Right. Milt Conrad, JR.          Okay,
          have a good one.

Ted and Rod and Wes return to their drinks.            Rod is not done
yet. He chews a rib thoughtfully, then...

                    ROD
          I get it. Why should          you just buy
          me a drink for free?          What have I
          done to earn it? But          you're in
          luck. I'm an actor.           I'll perform
          for it.

                       JT
          Cool.     Act like Sling Blade.

                    TED
          My two year old nephew can do Billy
          Bob from "Sling Blade." Do
          Shakespeare.

                       ROD
          The Bard.     Good choice.

Rod looks at the BARTENDER.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Greg, turn down the music for a
          second, I'm going to perform.

                    BARTENDER
          No. I threw you out of here two
          days ago.

Ted takes out a twenty and puts it on the bar.

                    TED
          Let him do it.       Then throw him out
          again.

Annoyed, the bartender lowers the volume.          Rod stands
silently. Lost in thought.

                       TED (CONT'D)
          Pirate #3?

                       ROD
          What?
 "Ricky Stanicky"          11.13.09        Bushell       14.


                    TED
          You going to do Shakespeare?

                     ROD
          Oh yeah.   Sorry.

Another long beat.

                    TED
          Dude, the "Bard?"

                    ROD
          Oh yeah, right.

Another long beat.

                    TED
          This isn't happening.       Let's go
          find seats.

The guys grab their drinks and are walking off when --

                    ROD
              (perfect English accent)
          But soft! What light through
          yonder window breaks! It is the
          East, and Juliet is the sun!

The guys are stunned.   Rod is amazing.

                     WES
          Wow.

                    TED
          Now do it as Sling Blade.

                    ROD

          That thou her maid art far more
          fair than she, be not her maid,

          her bestial livery is but sick and
          green and none but fools do wear
          it. Cast it off. It is my lady!

          O, it is my love! O, that she knew
          she were!

                    JT
          Harvey Keitel.

                    ROD
          Who the fuck is Harvey Keitel?

                       TED
          A pirate!

                     ROD
              (as a pirate)
          Aarggh, two of the fairest stars in
          all the heaven, Havin' some
          business do entreat her eyes to
          twinkle --

                    ROD
              (indecipherable Chewbacca
               speak)

The bar erupts in APPLAUSE.

                     TED
          That was the greatest thing I've
          ever seen.

                    ROD
          Thank, you. You are too kind.

Rod takes a bow and falls over.         The guys help him back up.

                    TED
          Buy that pirate whatever he wants.

                    ROD
          Three Heinekens, a whiskey chaser
          and a rack of ribs. And instead of
          the side of veggies, can I get a
          side of ribs?

                       BARTENDER
          Whatever.

The bartender hands the order to a server. He then serves
Rod's four drinks. Rod does the shot and downs a Heineken.
 "Ricky Stanicky"          11.13.09       Bushell         16.


                       JT
             You look like you could use some
             vegetables.

                        ROD
             Fool! Pirates don't eat vegetables!
                 (then)
             Hey, if you ever need my services,
             take this.

Rod takes out his wallet. It's mainly empty except for some
funny money from Spearmint Rhino. He removes a dirty
business card.

IT READS: ROD, ENTERTAINER! 555-2738. The number is crossed
out in pen. Under it the number 555 3967 is hand written.

                       TED
             Uh thanks... Rod.

A waiter brings up the plate of ribs. Rod spots a
bachelorette party in the corner of the bar.

                        ROD
             Oooh, bachelorette party.    Gotta
             run.
                  ("duty calls")
             Booty calls!
                  (he laughs really hard at
                   his joke, then, confused)
             Why the fuck am I laughing?

Rods gathers up his beer and ribs and exits towards the
bachelorettes.


EXT. BAR - LATER

It's late.    The place is nearly empty. Ted is on the phone
with Erin.    Wes sits behind him making the sound of a heart
monitor.

                        WES
             Boo wip.   Boo wip.

                       TED
             Ricky really appreciated it, Erin.
             He's resting now but he came
             through with flying colors.

                       ERIN
             Good. Well, we missed you but it
             was great. And my boss loved the
             tomato.
 "Ricky Stanicky"            11.13.09    Bushell   17.


                    TED
          I'm really glad it worked out.

                    ERIN
          Ted, it's so amazing what you did
          for Ricky. You're awesome.

                   TED
          No. It really wasn't that big a
          deal.

                    ERIN
          No. You worked long hours all
          week. For my dad, who's not the
          easiest person. Then you drove all
          night to be at your friend's side.
          You missed the fight. You won't
          get to see any football tomorrow.
          Your whole weekend got ruined so I
          went on Stub Hub and got you two
          tickets to see Pearl Jam tomorrow
          night.

This girl is awesome.    Ted feels terrible.

                       TED
          Pearl Jam?

                    ERIN
          They were really expensive but I
          know they're you're favorite band.
          And if you want to take JT or Wes
          and just hang with the guys, I
          totally understand. I don't need
          to go. I just wanted you to have
          some fun.

                    TED
          Erin, that's... uh... that's...
          I... I love you.

                    ERIN
          I love you, too.

Some drunk girls walk past in the B.G.

                    DRUNK GIRL
              (screams)
          I'll fuck anybody in here.

                    ERIN
          What was that?
 "Ricky Stanicky"          11.13.09     Bushell   18.


                    TED
          They were uh... rolling a girl up
          to the burn ward... I don't think
          she's going to make it... and she
          just wants one final chance at
          love.

                    ERIN
          That's so sad. Maybe you should
          get Wes together with her. He
          really needs to get laid.

                    WES
          Hey, that's not --.

JT elbows him.

                     WES (CONT'D)
          BOO WIP.

                    TED
          I think Ricky's waking up.    I have
          to go.

Ted hangs up.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          Did you just hear that? Tickets to
          Pearl Jam. I'm a bastard. The
          biggest bastard that ever lived.

                    JT
          Take me. Wes always gets
          claustrophobic at concerts.

                    WES
          That was one time at U2. And
          someone got trampled to death.

                    TED
          That's the coolest thing anyone has
          ever done for me. I lied my ass
          off and she bought me Pearl Jam
          tickets!

                    JT
          So you're taking me?

                     TED
          No.

                     JT
          Dick.

                    WES
          Yes!!
              (sings)
          OH I'M STILL ALIVE /     I'M...

                    TED
          Not you either. I'm taking Erin.
          Now give me the bible.

                    JT
          Now, let's see some strippers.

                    TED
          You know how this works. In the
          bible we record every detail of
          what we said about Ricky to whom we
          said it as soon as possible. So we
          never ever contradict our story.
          That's why we never get caught.

Wes takes out a ragged notebook with "Ricky Stanicky" on the
cover. Ted grabs it and flips through the pages looking for
a blank one. JT peers over Ted's shoulder looking at the
entries.

                    JT
              (re: the bible)
          Remember when you told Maureen
          Mahoney that you were in love with
          Ricky Stanicky and you were moving
          to Thailand to get married.

Wes LAUGHS.

                    WES
          Oh and remember when we told Susan
          that --

                    TED
          Can we focus, please?
              (writing)
          June 20, 2009. Told Erin that
          Ricky had testicular cancer.
          Removed one ball, left,... What
          did I say he said about it...
          earlier?

                    JT
          Uh... I think it was "it's okay,
          that's why god gave us two."

Ted writes that down.

                    WES
          Don't forget the Livestrong
          bracelet... You held it up.

                    JT
          That was a nice touch.

                       TED
          Okay.     Good.

Ted stops writing.    He closes the bible.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          Okay, this is officially the final
          entry in the long and infamous
          history of Ricky Stanicky.

                       WES
          What?

                       TED
          I'm done.     I'm not doing it
          anymore.

                       JT
          Why?

                    TED
          Because I don't want to lie to
          Erin.

                    JT
          What's the big deal? You've been
          using the Ricky excuse with your
          girlfriends since 7th grade.

                    TED
          But they were never as cool as
          Erin. She's so funny and strong
          and intelligent. And the Pearl Jam
          tickets.

                    JT
          I bet when she's not around you
          actually jerk off to her.

                    WES
          I know I do.

                    TED
              (to Wes)
          Please don't do that anymore.

                    WES
          Okay.

                    TED
          Talking to her tonight, I realized
          that I don't want to lie to her and
          I don't have to. She's that cool.
          I'm gonna marry her.

                    JT
          Then you definitely can't retire
          Ricky. He's the only thing that
          keeps my marriage alive.

                    WES
          You need to think this one through,
          Ted. You've been drinking.

                    JT
          Don't worry, Wes. He's said this
          before. Like right after we burnt
          down that house on Halloween.

JT snatches the bible and holds it up, leafing through all
the pages.

                    JT (CONT'D)
          We only used it like forty five
          times after that.

Ted snatches the bible back.

                    TED
          This time it's over. Wes, hand
          over the Ricky phone.

Wes grudgingly hands Ted the cell phone.    Ted pockets it.

                     TED (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen. It's the end of an era.
          Let's have one final toast. To
          Ricky Stanicky, the best friend we
          never had.

Wes and JT grudgingly raise their glasses.   Ted looks
satisfied. He's made the right choice.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A group of men and women sit around a massive conference room
table in a glass walled room with a view of the city.

HAROLD LAMBERT, 50's, imposing is addressing the group.   He
holds up a Mont Blanc Pen.

                    LAMBERT
          This is the same pen that I gave
          Jimmy Robbins when I made him head
          of sales. It's a fine writing
          instrument. Perfectly weighted,
          gold inlaid, solid onyx. And then
          Robbins betrayed me. The man who I
          considered family took four major
          clients and went to Garson and
          Taylor. Let me just say this, if I
          ever see Jimmy Robbins again, I
          will jam this fine writing
          instrument into his heart and I
          will drink his blood as it spurts
          out of his aorta. Now, we need a
          replacement. I would like to
          promote from within. Remember, I
          cherish loyalty. But if you betray
          me.

He jams the pen repeatedly into a Danish. ANGLE ON Ted and
JT, dressed business casual, watching, mildly horrified.

                     LAMBERT (CONT'D)
          That's all for now, people.    Ted.
          My office.


INT. LAMBERT'S OFFICE - DAY

Lambert sits in an incredible office overlooking Los Angeles.
Ted tries to get comfortable in the chair across from him.
There is a serious looking family picture of Lambert, his
daughters, Erin and Sarah, and his wife, Clare.

                    LAMBERT
          Uncomfortable?

                     TED
          No.   I'm good.

                    LAMBERT
          You're sitting in the most
          uncomfortable chair I could find.

                    LAMBERT (CONT'D)
          I bought it because I want the
          person across from me to be
          uncomfortable.

                      TED
          Really?

                    LAMBERT
          Make people uncomfortable and they
          know you're in control. When
          you're in control you own them. So
          how's my daughter?

                      TED
          Great...

Lambert looks at him hard.

                    LAMBERT
          What's wrong?

                    TED
          The chair...

                    LAMBERT
          She speaks very highly of you.

                      TED
          Thanks.    She's a great girl.

                    LAMBERT
          I've never met a man that's good
          enough for her. And I'm certain
          it's not you.

                    TED
          I appreciate your honesty, chief.

                    LAMBERT
          No you don't.   But you seem like a
          good employee. And Erin likes you a
          great deal. Her opinion is
          important to me. Ted, you keep
          this up, you could end up as the
          new head of sales. Just don't
          disappoint me. Or --

Lambert slashes his pen viciously through the air.


INT. TED'S HOUSE - DAY

JT and Wes are playing WII.     Ted is a reading a magazine.

                    WES
          What did we do before Wii?

                    JT
          Honestly, I don't remember.

Erin and Susan enter.

                    TED
          You guys have fun at the outlets?

Ted gives Erin a kiss.

                     ERIN
          So fun.   I got you a shirt and some
          jeans.

                     TED
          Thanks.

                    ERIN
          And while we were out, Susan had
          the best idea. We want to invite
          Ricky to your 30th birthday party.

                     TED
          Ricky?

                     SUSAN
          You guys are always talking about
          him. How much a part of your lives
          he is. But we've never met him.
          Which is a little bit odd, don't
          you think?

                     WES
          Nah.

                    ERIN
          And this is a big birthday.
          Thirty. He has to come.

                    TED
          It's not that big. Forty is the
          real milestone these days.

                     SUSAN
          He has to. Especially since he
          couldn't be at our wedding, which
          seems a little strange, don't you
          think, JT?

                     JT
          Uh...
 "Ricky Stanicky"         11.13.09        Bushell   25.


                    TED
          We might have to wait months. I
          think his missionary work in South
          America lasts until the spring.

                    SUSAN
          That's funny, because JT was out
          with him just the other night.

                    JT
          He flew back in early. The Amazon
          flooded and washed away the
          village.

Ted looks at JT.

                    ERIN
          So you'll have him come right?

                    TED
          Uh... well... I'll do my best.


INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

Ted, Wes and JT are sitting in a booth.

                    JT
          Susan caught me coming back from a
          strip club.   So I told her that I
          was there with Ricky. We were
          trying to rescue some girl from a
          life of sin and bring her back to
          her family.

                    TED
          What is wrong with you?

                    JT
          You try getting married. It's the
          same woman day after day. Month
          after month. Year after year.

                    TED
          You've only been married five
          months!

                    JT
          It's not normal! We never have
          sex. And when we do, it's with
          each other!

                    TED
          You know the rules!   We always use
          Ricky as a group. Never alone. We
          only use it in cases of emergency.
          And we never use it to cheat or to
          go strip clubs. Also, he was
          supposed to be retired!

                    JT
          Well you weren't using him anymore
          so I just said F the rules.

                    TED
          The rules were the only thing that
          kept something like this from
          happening. At least Wes has the
          sense to follow them.

Wes is still silent.

                      TED (CONT'D)
          Oh no.    What did you do?

                    WES
          Uh, here's the thing... Nana has
          busted me with some stuff over the
          past few months.

                                               QUICK CUT TO:


INT. NANA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sitting in a wheel chair. Wes's grandma, NANA holds up a
bong. Her cane lies across her lap.

                    WES
          That's Ricky Stanicky's bong.

                                                JUMP CUT TO:

Nana holds up a samurai sword.

                    WES (CONT'D)
          That's Ricky Stanicky's sword.

                                                JUMP CUT TO:

Nana holds a flesh colored, rubbery "Pocket Pussy."

                    WES (CONT'D)
          That's Ricky Stanicky's pocket
          pussy.

                    NANA
          Watch your mouth!!

Nana hits Wes with her cane.

                    WES
          Pocket vagina, I mean.

She hits him again.

                      NANA
          Wesley!

                    WES
          Vagina's a medical term!

She hits him again so hard she breaks her cane.

                    WES (CONT'D)
          God damn it, Nana.

She grabs the pocket pussy and wails on him with it.

                                                  BACK TO:


INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Wes is still talking.

                    WES
          If Nana finds out I've been lying
          to her she'll kick me out of the
          house. She kicked my cousin Oliver
          out last year because he gave away
          the ending of an episode of "Murder
          She Wrote."

                    JT
          Nana'll find out if Susan and Erin
          do. Susan will call her just to
          spite us.

          Just when I think I'm out, you pull
          me back in.
              (then)
          Because you guys suck so hard,
          she's going to find out that I've
          been lying to her and she's going
          to leave me.

          What about all those golf rounds
          with Ricky that you charged to the
          company?

                    TED
          I did that before we retired him.
          And you guys played too!

                    JT
          Lambert finds out about those and
          the lies you told his daughter and
          he's going give you a Mont Blanc
          tracheotomy.

                     TED
               (a beat)
          Maybe I can tell Erin the truth.
          Beg her for forgiveness. Buy her
          tickets to the ballet. She loves
          the ballet. And I always blow it
          off.

                    JT
          That'll work. She'll forgive you.
          Right before she leaves you for a
          richer, better looking guy who's
          not a total asshole.

                    TED
          I don't have much of a choice.

                    WES
          What about us? If this comes out
          I'll end up living in a cardboard
          box.

                    JT
          If this comes out, my dick will end
          up in a cardboard box.

          Ted, please --

                    TED
          Okay... let me think.

A beat. The waiter walks up with the check. Ted opens his
wallet and takes out his credit card. As he does, Rod's
grimy business card falls out. He looks at it.

ROD

"ENTERTAINER"


INT. GOLD COAST ROOM - LATER

A cellphone RINGS somewhere in a trashed suite. A hand digs
through an avalanche of beer bottles and drink cups and finds
the phone, partially submerged in a warm cup of beer.

The hand brings the dripping wet phone up to its ear. Widen
to REVEAL Rod holding the phone. He's face down and bare
assed, lying in between two naked girls from a bachelorette
party. He wears a penis shape balloon around his head.

                    ROD
          This is Pirate number three.


INT. AIRPORT - LATER

The guys stand at the gate watching the people mover.

                    JT
          It'll never work.    He's a mess.

                    TED
          You saw the performance he gave at
          the bar.

                    WES
          But he's not like Ricky at all.
          He's a total fraud.

                    TED
          All we need is a few good hours out
          of him. We sober him up, we dress
          him up. We teach him everything he
          needs to know. He comes to the
          party. Tells a couple of stories.
          Then we pay him a thousand bucks,
          put him on a plane and send him
          home. And we never use the excuse
          again.

In the distance we see Rod on the people mover. Four days
beard growth. Shades. A duffle bag over his shoulder. He
sees them and waves enthusiastically.

                    TED (CONT'D)

The waving is apparently too strenuous and he falls over on
the people mover. JT and Wes look really worried. Ted
forces a smile.


INT. NANA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ted, Wes and JT bring Rod inside.    As they do Ted hands Rod
five hundred dollars.

                    TED
          ... Remember the deal. Five
          hundred dollars up front. And five
          hundred when you complete your
          services.

                    ROD
          Can I get the other five hundred in

Teri crosses on his way out.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Rod is getting a short hair cut and a shave as Ted looks on.
He gives the woman cutting Ricky's hair instructions. JT
sits off to the side in salon chairs pretending to read Cosmo
while checking out women getting hair cuts. Wes is actually
reading Vogue intrigued by an article titled, "10 WAYS TO

INT. NANA'S BASEMENT - DAY

Ted, JT and Wes struggle down the stairs with a brand new
exercise treadmill in a box.

                    TED (V.O.)
          Despite his illness, Ricky is in
          incredible physical shape. He has

          Okay, I'll push through.

Rod takes two more steps, then pushes the stop button.   The
tread mill stops. He bends over and pukes.

          I run better if I'm drunk.

                    TED
          No. No. No. Ricky is a
          teetotaller. He doesn't drink.

Rod goes pale.   And pukes again.

Rod is sweating like a pig, drinking a sports drink and
smoking a cigarette. Ted takes the smoke out of Ricky's
hand.

                    TED
          Ricky doesn't smoke.

Wes comes over with a box of nicotine patches and puts one on
Rod's arm. A beat. Rod sits for a second.

                      ROD
          Nothing.    Hit me again.

          I think that's above the
          recommended dosage.

            These jeans are so tight, my junk

            Ball.    Ricky only has one ball.

                       ROD
            Really?   Why?

            They just removed it.

                      ROD
            Okay, if there's some girl I need
            to get on, I'll just suck it back
            in.

                        JT
            What?!

                      ROD
            The human body is capable of
            incredible things.

                      TED
            That won't be necessary. Ricky
            took an abstinence pledge. He's
            saving himself for marriage.

                      ROD
            What? No booze, no smokes, no
            pussy. Next thing you're going to
            tell me the guy's a vegetarian.

                        WES
            Vegan.

Rod gags.

                      TED
            Not on the Armani shirts.

Ted covers Rod's mouth. Rod composes himself. Then puke
shoots out of his nose and all over the shirt rack. A sales
person looks at them shocked.

          Wrap that up and add it to our

INT. NANA'S HOUSE - LATER

Now Rod has two nicotine patches on each shoulder.     They
look at him. Is it working?

                    ROD
          Hit me again!


INT. NANA'S BASEMENT - DAY

Rod is running while Ted watches.    JT and Wes sit in torn up
recliners playing Wii.

                    TED
          Looking good.

                    ROD
          Yeah, I got this.    This is really a
          lot --

Rod falls over, and the tread mill throws him into the wall
so hard it leaves a Rod shaped dent in the dry wall. Ted
shakes his head.


INT. NANA'S HOUSE - LATER

Both of Rod's arms are covered in nic patches again.

                    WES
          Where am I supposed to put another
          one?

Rod drop his pants.   Wes sticks one on his ass.   A beat.

                    ROD
          Ooh, that's the spot.


INT. NANA'S BASEMENT - DAY

Rod is running now. Focused. Locked on.   Ted pushes the
speed up button. Rod speeds up.  No problem. Ted nods.

                    TED
          Wes, I think you can get some
          plaster and fix your wall.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Erin sits alone checking her watch.      A MAN, 30's, comes up
next to her.

                    MAN
          Is this seat taken?

                    ERIN
          Uh... yeah. My boyfriend's coming.

                    MAN
          That is a lucky guy.       You are
          incredible.

                       ERIN
          Thanks.

                    MAN
          Just in case, let me give you this.

He quickly writes his number on the cocktail napkin and
slides it to her. She hands it back to him. Ted watches
this from the doorway.

                       ERIN
          No thanks.

The guy turns and exits passing Ted.      Ted sits down with
Erin.

                    TED
          Was that guy just trying to pick
          you up?

                   ERIN
          Yeah. I gave him the Heisman,
          though.

She poses like the Heisman Trophy, arm extended to ward off
tacklers.

                     ERIN (CONT'D)
          I have to use the ladies.      Then
          let's eat.

Erin exits.   The man walks up to Ted.

                    GUY
          How the hell did you end up with
          that?
 "Ricky Stanicky"         11.13.09    Bushell          36.


The guy shakes his head and exits. Through the window, Ted
sees him hand a valet a ticket. After a beat, the valet
pulls up in a Ferrari and climbs out. The guy gets in.


EXT. GOLF RANGE - NIGHT

Ted stands with Ricky, at the golf range. Rod takes out his
iPhone and presses record. He places it on the divider
between the booths in the driving range.

                    TED
          Erin rented out this range for the
          party because golf is my favorite
          sport.

                    ROD
          Aww, that's sweet.

                    TED
          Yeah she's awesome. She's the best
          thing that ever happened to me.
          She's smart, and funny and
          beautiful and so cool. It's weird.
          I spent most of my life using Ricky
          to ditch my girlfriends so I could
          hang out with my boys. But after I
          got to know Erin, I realized if I
          could, I would've used Ricky to
          ditch my boys and hang out with
          her. I've never felt that way
          about any woman before.

                    ROD
          Wow. Don't worry, I won't mess
          this up for you. I'm a pro.

                    TED
          Good. Now, Ricky is an excellent
          golfer. People will probably
          expect him to hit a couple of balls
          at the party.

Ted hands Rod a club. Rod walks up to the ball. Addresses
it confidently. He hacks at it violently, whiffing. The
club flies from his hands out onto the range. Rod runs out
and grabs it, ducking out of the way of errant shots.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          You've never played before have
          you?

                    ROD
              (impressed)
          How'd you know?

                    TED
          The only thing you need to hit is a
          5 iron. Watch me.

Ted takes the club, addresses the ball and takes an easy
swing. He hands Rod back the club. Rod hacks violently
again. Rod hits the ball, this time both the club and ball
go flying. Still the club makes it past the ball.


EXT. GOLF RANGE

Rod hits a dribbler. But manages to hold onto his club.    Ted
nods. He walks around and corrects Rod's grip.


EXT. GOLF RANGE - LATER

Ted watches as Rod hits a passable shot.   Nothing great but
contact.

                    ROD
          You are like the Milt Conrad Jr. of
          golf.

                    TED
          Milt Conrad Jr.?

                    ROD
          My director. He's a genius.

                     TED
          Uh... thanks.
              (then)
          If I could, I'd just play golf. No
          high pressure sales job. No crazy
          ass boss. My favorite time is when
          I'm swinging a club.

                    ROD
          You should do it.

                    TED
          Erin would never be with a guy who
          was a golf bum.

                    ROD
          You never know. I'm just a
          homeless actor and I've dated some
          pretty incredible women, including
          Trishell from the "Real World
          Vegas," and Emma Kariopa.

                    TED
          Who's Emma Kariopa?

                    ROD
          Her tits were in a scene on
          "Entourage." Seriously, look it
          up. She's listed on IMDB.

                     TED
          No.   I got to keep this job.

                    ROD
          Sometimes you got to follow your
          dream. Like me. I'm an actor.
          And Ricky might be my greatest
          role. Even greater than Leissl in
          "The Sound of Music."

Rod enters wearing skinny jeans and a stylish shirt. His
hair is short and neat, he's clean shaven. He even looks
healthier. Wes hands Rod the fake license.

          It depends on who you're talking
          to. See thanks to Wes, Ricky is
          different things to different
          people. Which makes your job
          harder. The Ricky that Wes has
          told his grandmother about is a lot
          closer to how you are now. But the
          Ricky that we've told Erin and
          Susan about is a saint.

                    ROD
          I get it. So if it's Nana I tell
          her a pocket pussy is how I keep my
          dick warm every night.

          kitten that I rescued from a roof

Rod stares blankly, not reacting to the name.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          You're Ricky!

Rod takes out the license from his pocket and looks at it.

EXT. GOLF RANGE - NIGHT

Erin, Ted, Susan and JT walk up to the golf range.  It is
decorated with streamers. Some of his friends are hitting
balls and having drinks.

                     TED
              (looking around for Ricky)
          This is great. I love how you
          decorated.

                    ERIN
          I knew you would.

                   SUSAN
          Yeah. Freaking great.      Where's
          Ricky?

ANGLE ON Wes in a stall, his arm around Rod to support him.
Rod waves.

                    ROD
          Ted!!

Rod nearly falls over.

                    ERIN
          I thought he didn't drink.

                    SUSAN
          Seriously, what the hell is going
          on?

JT looks away.

                    TED
          Yeah, uh --

Rod lets go of Wes, staggers forward and picks up a five
iron. He grabs the railing to steady himself.

                    ROD
          Check out this fiver iron.

He gets in position and dramatically waggles. It's almost
sexual. Rod finally takes his club back knocking the ball
off the tee.

                    TED
          Erin, there's something I have to
          tell you.

JT begins shaking his head "no," pleading.     But Ted sees no
way out.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          The thing is Ricky is --

                    ROD
          Before I hit this, I want to tell
          you all a story about Ted. After
          Katrina, I volunteered in New
          Orleans. One weekend Ted and Wes
          and JT came down to help. While I
          was in a boat rescuing stranded
          people off of roof tops, they were
          back at base camp serving coffee
          and soup. Saturday afternoon, my
          boat was so full of people that the
          gunwale was only about six inches
          above the water.

His delivery is so compelling suddenly we're there seeing it
with him, as if it were real.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Rod sits in a boat packed with rescued people wrapped in
blankets. A local man drives. They coast up to a submerged
house. ON the roof is an old woman (AUNT ESTHER) with a
menagerie of animals. Dogs, birds, a three legged kitten.

                    ROD (V.O.)
          On top of one house an old lady was
          stranded. She didn't want to leave
          without her pets. They were her
          family. But the boat was full.

Rod climbs off to help her, but she won't budge. Rod begins
pleading with her. The boat driver shakes his head. Sadly,
the woman steps off the roof. She gets in the boat. Rod
gets on his cellphone and calls back to base.

                    ROD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I called base camp to see if we
          could get another boat for the
          animals.

INTERCUT RED CROSS BASE CAMP - DAY / HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

JT, Wes, and Ted ladle hot soup out to cold, wet rescuees.
Ted watches a Red cross OFFICIAL on the phone with Rod. The
official explains why they can't save the pets.

                    ROD (V.O.)
          But all the boats had to be used to
          rescue people.

Ted stares at the official thinking.

END INTERCUT


EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The woman looks mournfully at her pets and they drift off.

                    ROD (V.O.)
          Then something amazing happened.


EXT. RED CROSS BASE CAMP - LATER

Wes, and JT serve the rescued people hot cups of coffee.
Aunt Esther sobs on Rod's shoulder. Then Ted appears rowing
a tiny leaky canoe packed with the animals. Dogs take up the
floor space. A parrot rests on one shoulder, a rabbit on
another, and in his lap is a three legged kitten.

                    ROD (V.O.)
          Ted found the worst boat in New
          Orleans and brought back those
          animals on his own.

He pulls up to shore. The dogs leap out and run to their
owner. She hugs them overjoyed.

                                                     BACK TO:


EXT. GOLF RANGE - CONTINUOUS

People are moved.   Some dab their eyes.

                    ROD
          That's Ted. Always doing stuff for
          other people. Tonight, we're doing
          something for you. Happy birthday,
          buddy.

Rod swings and crushes it, his follow through turns him away
from the group for a moment.

              (to himself; facing away

          And scene.

                    ERIN
          What a great story.

                    TED
              (shocked)
          Yeah.

                    ERIN
          What'd you want to tell me?

                    TED
          Uh... just that uh... sometimes
          Ricky's meds make him seem a little
          bit tipsy. Side effects.

Rod approaches them and hugs Ted.    Then grabs Erin by the
hands.

                    ROD
          Erin. You are so much more
          beautiful than the photos that Ted
          is always showing us. I mean
          always. He never stops.

                    TED
          Why would I? She's so hot.

Erin blushes.

                     ROD
          This guy loves you. Seriously.
          Loves. Okay, I don't want to
          embarrass him. Erin, let's get a
          virgin daiquiri and I'll tell you
          about how he never stops talking
          about you.

Susan walks up, deliberately and grabs Rod's hand.

                    SUSAN
          Let me do it. Erin, you stay with
          the birthday boy.

Susan starts to walk off with Rod. Ted spots the edge of a
nicotine patch just protruding over the top of Rod's collar.

          Wait.

Ted grabs Rod into a hug.

                       TED (CONT'D)
             So good to see you, bro.

As they part Ted COUGHS and deftly rips the patch off Rod's
neck.

                       ROD
                 (whimper)

ANGLE ON Rod and Susan.      Susan holds a cosmo.       Rod holds a
virgin daiquiri.

                       SUSAN
             Seriously, what kind of name is
             Stanicky? It sounds made up.

                       ROD
                 (deftly)
             Stanicky's not really my last name.
             When my grandparents came through
             Ellis island, after fleeing the
             purges of the Bolsheviks, they
             misheard it. The real last name is
             Stravinsky.

                       SUSAN
                 (intrigued)
             Like Igor Stravinsky?      The
             composer?

                       ROD
             My great great Uncle.

                       SUSAN
             You know I work at the concert

          When I pulled that three legged cat
          off of her roof and gave it back to
          Aunt Esther, that was the greatest
          feeling I've ever had. Except when
          it gave birth to a litter of three
          legged kittens.

ANGLE ON Rod and Susan

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Few people know it but Stravinsky
          wasn't just a musician. He also

          Ted, that Ricky is very impressive.
          Most of your friends are complete

LAMBERT'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - LATER

Ted sits in the uncomfortable chair. Lambert seems to be in
good spirits. He is straightening a framed picture of he and
Hilary Clinton smoking fat cigars.

                    TED
          Hilary Clinton never struck me as a
          cigar smoker.

                    LAMBERT
          Oh yeah. Three double coronas a
          day. Anyway, I was reviewing some
          records with the guys from
          accounting. You played a lot of
          rounds of golf with Ricky haven't
          you?

                     TED
          A few.

                    LAMBERT
          Close to four times over the past
          year.

Ted looks worried.

                    TED
          Was it that many?

                    LAMBERT
          One round at PGA West came out to
          four hundred and eighty dollars in
          greens fees alone.

                    TED
          Yeah but there's a lot of potential
          there. With Ricky. And golf's
          important for client relations.

                    LAMBERT
          I agree and Ricky is quite a guy.
          That's why I'm not mad at you.

Ted is relieved.

          recruit a piece of talent like

          I'm sorry?

                    LAMBERT

                    LAMBERT
          That's the exciting news I told you
          about. I called him last night.
          Booked him on a plane back to LA.
          I thought you'd be thrilled.

          Oh...I am... I

                    LAMBERT
          I know, you wanted to take over the
          department. But your skills lie
          more in traditional business.
          Ricky is a total original. He's
          the type of guy who one day might
          end up as CEO.

          Look at it from my perspective.
          You guys paid me a thousand
          dollars. Which was awesome. But
          Lambert offered me 150,000 dollars
          a year.

                    RICKY
          I know. I didn't take it though.

          Look, the money and the car are

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Mr. Lambert and a couple of corporate heavies sit at one side
of the table. Ted, Ricky, JT and five other sales associates
are on the other side of the table.

                    MR. LAMBERT
          Ted, why don't you run us through
          the sales strategy for the second
          quarter of this year?

                    TED
          I was thinking that Ricky might
          want to lead the meeting.

                     MR. LAMBERT
          Already?   He just started.

          But he's got great ideas. Tons of
          them. That's why we brought him
          in.

                       MR. LAMBERT
          Okay.     Ricky, what do you have?

                    ROD
          Thanks for the vote of confidence
          Ted, but I think you should run
          this meeting. I'm not up to speed.

                    MR. LAMBERT
          Seems smart.

                    ROD
              (to Mr. Lambert)
          I like to delegate.

                      MR. LAMBERT
          Ted.    Go ahead.

                    TED
          Ricky's going to run the
          department. I think it's good to
          just hand him the rudder and let
          him steer. And people do their
          best work when they're
          uncomfortable.

                       MR. LAMBERT
          Love that.     Ricky, you're up.

          Gentlemen, I ask you this -- does
          non profit have to be non profit?

                    MR. LAMBERT
          What are you saying?

                    ROD
          I mean, why can't we make profit
          off of non profit?

                    MR. LAMBERT
          I'm not sure if I understand that.

                    GARY
          Wait, I think I get it. You're
          saying just like companies will
          make profits off the Obama
          administration's green

          friendly cars and recyclable
          products that perhaps we can make a
          profit in traditionally non profit
          fields?

                       ROD
          Bingo.     It's feel good investing.

                    MR. LAMBERT
          Feel good investing. What a catch
          phrase!

                    TED
          It's catchy, but is there anything
          there that will actually make us
          money.

Lambert stands up.    He looks excited.

                    MR. LAMBERT
          With a catch phrase like that how
          can't we make money? Feel good

          I'll come with you.

Rod is about to walk in after her when Ted opens the rib
smoker. A rack of ribs is slow cooking on it. Rod can't
stop looking at it.

                    TED
          Ricky, help me here for a second.
          I need an extra set of hands with
          these ribs.

Ted shoves a dripping "rib mop into Rod's hand and opens up
the grill. The smell of slow cooked meat wafts in. Ted
takes some spices out and starts putting them in a bowl of
bbq sauce.

Ted uses a spoon to taste it.

          Damn that's good. The secret is
          slow cooked bacon.

Ted "accidentally" flips some sauce off the spoon onto
Ricky's chin. Some of it lands right on his bottom lip.
Ricky tries desperately not to lick it off.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          I think the ribs are ready.

Ted pulls a rib off the bbq and holds it up very close to
Rod's face. Ted takes a bite, bbq sauce dripping down his
chin. His hands are covered in it.

Ted slowly, licks his fingers. Rod reflexively grabs Ted's
hand and starts bringing his bbq'ed sauce finger to his
mouth. He licks it.

                    ROD
          I'm Ricky. Rod is dead. I cut off
          his fingers, pulled out his teeth
          and buried him in an unmarked grave

He taps himself on the head. Ted watches as Sarah walks
inside the house. Ted hands Ricky a long bbq fork.

                    ROD
          Right.

          Grab your stuff, we got a meeting.


EXT. LAKEVIEW GOLF COURSE - DAY

Ted pulls up to Lakeview golf course.

                    ROD
          Why are we here?

                    TED
          Toyo Yamashidi. Remember? Prentiss
          invited you to play golf with him.

                    ROD
          But I can't play --

PRENTISS and Mr. Lambert walk up with TOYO Yamashidi.

                    PRENTISS
          Ricky! Ted. This is Toyo
          Yamashidi. He's interested in
          offering our investment products to
          the Japanese market.

Toyo shakes hands with them.

                    TOYO
          I hear great things about you.

                    ROD
          Domo Arrigato.

                    LAMBERT
          Ted was telling us about the flop
          shot you hit with the 60 degree.
          He says you can make it stop dead
          on a ball mark.

                    TOYO
          I can't wait to see that.

                    TED
          Oh don't worry, you will. He could
          hit that shot in his sleep.

                    PRENTISS
          Okay, tee time in twenty.    See you
          there.

Rod starts to sweat a little.

                    ROD
          I can't play golf.    You set me up.

                    TED
          If you really are Ricky Stanicky,
          you should have no problem.


EXT. FIRST TEE - DAY

Prentiss hits a perfect shot.

                    LAMBERT
          You got all of that.

                       TED
          Yeah.     That'll play.

                    PRENTISS
          Ricky, you're up.

Rod walks up to the tee. He tees the ball up.       He stands
over the ball for a long beat.

                       ROD
          Damn!     Forgot something in my car.

Rod drops his club an goes running off.

                    LAMBERT
          But our tee time... there's a group
          behind us--

Rod is gone.

                    TED
          I'll get him back.

Ted follows Rod.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Rod walks up to the valet and gives him his ticket. Ted
follows him. The valet runs over and gets Rod's car.

                    TED
          So it's over. You're finally
          walking away?

The valet pulls up, gets out and opens the door for Rod. Rod
puts his hand in the open doorway and slams the door on it.

                       ROD
          Aaaaaah!!!     My hand!

Ted and the valet are stunned.

                       TED
          Holy crap.

Rod hands the keys back to the valet and a ten dollar bill.

                    ROD
          Okay, I'm good. Just wipe the
          blood off the keys.

Rod heads back toward the tee with his hand. He smiles at Ted
whose jaw hangs open in utter shock.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Role of a life time, Ted.     Role of
          a life time.

The valet looks at Ted and shakes his head.

                    VALET

EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST HOLE

Rod's hand is bandaged. Rod is in a cart with Toyo. Toyo is
with Prentiss. Ted holds onto the back with the bags. He's
at a complete loss.

                    PRENTISS
          I can't believe that valet slammed
          your hand in the door.

                    LAMBERT
          You should have him fired.

                    ROD
          Come on, he's got a family.
          Besides maybe some day he could be
          one of our biggest investors.

                    TED
          Yeah, right.

                    TOYO
          As a boy, I worked as a valet in
          Japan. Parking cars for rich
          people. And look at me now.

                    ROD
          Look at him! Everybody's got a
          secret. Right, Ted?

Ted is silent.

                    TOYO
          Lambert. You hire good people.
          That makes me think that you've got
          good products. After our game my
          bank and I would like to talk to
          you about an investment commitment.

Ted nearly falls off the cart.   Lambert shakes Toyo's hand.

                    LAMBERT
          We can do that for sure, Toyo.

Lambert steps out of the cart and grabs a club.

                    LAMBERT (CONT'D)
          Okay, Ted. Run up to the bend and
          keep an eye on my ball.

                    TED
              (shocked)
          You want me to caddy for real?

                    ROD
          Maybe we should fire Ted instead.

Everyone LAUGHS.    Ted jogs off, fuming.


INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ted is in his office with JT.

                    JT
          Rod brought in three million in
          business from Toyo?

                    TED
          He also slammed his own hand in the
          door of his car so he wouldn't get
          discovered. He's psycho.

                    JT
          Why are you so hostile to him?
          Ricky's good people.

                    TED
          His name is Rod. And you said if
          he stuck around, he was going to
          get you in trouble with Susan.

                    JT
          Yeah, but then he got Susan to fuck
          me in "Bed Bath and Beyond."

                    TED
          You're selling me out because you
          had sex in a home furnishing store?

                    JT
          It was so freaking awesome. Next
          week she's going to blow me on top
          of a giant paper towel bundle in
          Cost Co.

                    TED
          Wow. At least Wes agrees that we
          need to get rid of him.

                   JT
          Really? Let's get him on the phone
          and ask.

Jt goes over to Ted's phone.    He dials an internal number.

                    WES (O.S.)
          Ricky Stanicky's office.

                    JT
          Wes, come down to Ted's office.

                    WES
          Sure thing, JT.

JT hangs up. Ted looks confused.     Wes enters wearing khakis
and an Izod shirt.

                    WES (CONT'D)
          I'm rocking the business casual.
          You like?

                    TED
          Ricky hired you as his assistant?

                    WES
          He thought I was getting creatively
          stifled living with Nana. But with
          the money I'm making, I'm going to
          be able to get my own place. And
          the best part is he's helping me
          with my pot themed kid's books.
          Lining up investors.

                    TED
          But I thought we were trying to get
          rid of him.

                    WES
          How could I? The guy is like my
          own real life cookie monster. He
          even pitched me the idea for my
          second book. "Mommy Bakes with
          Special Herbs."

                    JT
          Ted, you need to relax and go along
          with this ride.

                    WES
          Seriously, You cannot believe how
          out of hand this is going to be.

JT and Wes exit.    Ted doesn't know what to do.


KITCHEN AREA - LATER

Ricky is making himself a cup of coffee and talking to Erin.

                    ERIN

          This business means everything to

          I'm just glad I can help.

                    ERIN
          You are such a good guy.

Erin kisses Rod on the cheek as Ted enters.

          What the hell is going on?

                    ERIN
          I came to have lunch with both of
          my guys.

          Both of your guys?

                    ROD
          I set it up. Nice surprise, huh?
          But that's what friends are for.

                    TED
          I don't want to go lunch.

                    ERIN
          If you're too busy, Ricky and I
          will go together.

                     TED
          Okay, this has to end. Erin, I
          need to tell you the truth. He's
          not really Ricky Stanicky. He's
          some out of work actor from Vegas
          named Rod.

                    ERIN
          Huh?

                    TED
          I used a made up friend to get out
          of some things like your dinner
          party and I was afraid if you found
          out, you'd never forgive me. So I
          covered by bringing Rod in to
          pretend to be Ricky.

         That's the craziest thing I ever

         Totally nuts!

                   TED
         Why would I make that up?

                   ROD
         You're clearly jealous of our
         relationship. I'm not a threat,
         amigo.

                   TED
         I'm telling you the truth. We've
         been using this excuse for years.
         I used it with all of my
         girlfriends before you. And the LA
         fire department.

                   ERIN
         And you never got caught?

                   TED
         We were careful. We destroyed any
         incriminating evidence.

                   ERIN
         Convenient.

                   ROD
         Yeah, I'd say.

         His name is Ricky.

         But I have the bible.

         The bible?

Rod takes out a dog eared pocket size King James bible.

          I always keep it right here, next

          You know the bible I'm talking

          Ted, calm down.

Ted hits him again.

                    ROD
          You know I don't fight. I follow
          the non violent teachings of Gandhi

Security grabs Ted dragging him out.

                    TED
          I appreciate you letting me stay
          here, but, it's hard for me to be
          friends with someone who sold me
          out for a fake guy who removed his
          own ball.

                    WES
          I'm pretty sure he was just sucking
          it in.

          Wes, listen to yourself.

                    WES
          Ted, I have some really excellent
          weed in the house. Smoke it. I have
          porn. Watch it. I have a pocket
          pussy. Fuck it. The place is yours.

INT. NANA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ted walks into Nana's room.

                       NANA
             Ted. Sorry to hear about Erin.
             How are you?

                       TED
             Terrible. She was the best thing
             that ever happened to me.

                       NANA
             She was very sweet. I know that
             Wesley was quite fond of her too.
             Had a picture of her in his room
             right above his box of tissues.

             Really?
                 (then)
             Well, she's gone.    I blew it.

                       NANA
             Maybe I can help you out. See Ted,
             I'm 87 years old. Can't walk too
             well. Can't hear too well. Can't
             even kneel at church without losing
             circulation in my legs. But I have
             one thing that always buoys my
             spirits.

She reaches for her bible, then pushes it aside revealing a
fresh bottle of Oxycontin.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

JT, Susan, Wes, Erin and Rod walk through the hotel.   Rod is
talking to Susan and Erin. Wes and JT walk behind.

                    SUSAN
          It's good that you came here, Erin.
          Get your mind off of Ted.

                    ERIN
          Yeah. I never expected him to flip
          out like that. The other day, he
          seemed so... lost.

Rod puts his arm around her.

                    ROD
          But there's hope. I was once lost.
          too. Yay though I walk in the
          valley of death I shall fear no --

ANGLE ON JT and Wes

                    WES
          You should've seen him when I left.
          He was a mess. I don't know if I
          can do this anymore.

                    JT
          Do not fuck this up for me. When we
          get back from Vegas, Susan said
          she'd pee on me in the Gap.

          exactly what Ricky said.
              (then)
          He has his vices. But he's a
          terrific dancer. And an even
          better actor.

                    TED
          Best actor I've ever seen.

                    NANA
          Yeah. I saw him on this show.        He
          was a pirate. Like Bob Hope.

                       TED
          A pirate?     Where'd you see the
          show?

Ted grabs the remote.    He pushes guide.

          Do you remember what it was called?

                       NANA
          Nope.     It was late at night.

Ted looks disappointed.

                    NANA (CONT'D)
          I did record it on the DVR.

Ted's eyes go wide.

                    SAMANTHA BROWN
          Looks like I dropped a few too many
          nickels in the slots. But I know
          how to cheer myself up.


EXT. TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - CONTINUOUS

A group of Pirates are taking part in the famous treasure
island show.

A pirate draws his sword and charges another very drunken
pirate who holds a bottle of rum. Although in a hat and eye
patch this guy is Rod. He drunkenly fights with the sober
pirate. It's an excellent Jackie Chan style drunken fight.

                    ROD (AS DRUNK PIRATE)
          Shiver me timbers. No scalliwag
          gets in the way of me rummin'

FROM NANA'S POV we see Ted who thinks he's astride the back
of a unicorn.   Of course there's nothing there. She shakes
her head.

          Oh you have no idea.

                    MILT
          I do. He became an alcoholic to
          make his performance as Pirate #3
          more compelling. Then he tried to
          fight a real duel with the guy that
          played his mortal enemy Mr.
          Wainscott. Luckily he was so drunk
          he shot and stabbed himself.

                    TED
          Well, he had a testicle removed to
          play Ricky Stanicky.

                    MILT
          Wow. That's a whole new level.

                    TED
          How do I get rid of him?

                     MILT
          No easy task. He wore the pirate
          costume and came to rehearsal for
          three months after I fired him. I
          had to have him banned from the
          hotel. After that he slept in the
          crow's nest of the fake pirate ship
          until security found him.
              (then)
          If you could give him a big finale.
          One great climactic scene he might
          feel like the role is complete.
          But that's easier said than done.

                    TED
          Might be easier to just get his
          real identity and expose him. You
          have access to personnel files? A
          copy of a birth certificate or a
          drivers license --

                    MILT
          He signed his working papers as Rod
          Cozette. Apparently he just
          finished a run on Les Mis. Hell of
          an actor though.

                    TED
          No one will believe me unless I
          have some real info on the guy.

                    MILT
          I'd like to help you. God knows he
          drove me crazy every day saying he
          should be Pirate #1.

                    TED
          What about you and the guys that
          worked with him? Will you admit
          that Rod is a fraud?

          Why would you want to do that?

some note cards. Wes stands over by a laptop working a power
point presentation.

                    ROD
          Thank you. Today I want to talk to
          you about Feel Good Investing. As
          you know I'm a man who spent many
          years trying to give back to the
          community doing non profit. And I
          wondered why can't not for profit
          be for profit.

A power point graphic comes up.

NOT FOR PROFIT=PROFIT

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Why can't we make money and do good
          for people at the same time? Let's
          start with the housing sector.
          We're going to sell feel good
          building bonds.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          Our investors buy bonds where all
          of the money will be used to buy
          housing for people who lost their
          homes in natural disasters. Then
          in two years, people will think
          we're so great they're going to
          invest in our building companies.

An investor raises his hand.

                    INVESTOR
          But how will you pay back your
          investors for the free houses?

He sits next to Erin, Sarah and Clare.

                    LAMBERT

          with no return.

                    ERIN
          Maybe there's an explanation.

                    ROD
          It's charity.   We're just laying
          the groundwork.

          Correct! Ten points to the man in
          the conservative blue suit. But
          this is just a small piece of the

A GRAPHIC comes up with illustrations   from Wes' books. One
is called, "DON'T BOGART THAT SPLIFF:    A BOOK ABOUT SHARING."

          This happens when he goes off book.
          I let him re write his own scene
          once. At the end he married the
          Pope and moved to Narnia.

                    ROD
          We believe legalizing marijuana is
          not just a good thing for people
          who are sick like I was. It can
          lead to big profit. And these
          books will give us a foothold in
          the legal marijuana market for
          years to come.

              (low voiced, in shock)
          My company. I'm ruined.

                    ERIN
          Daddy, I'm sorry.

Erin looks around not sure what to do. She sees Ted in the
back with the pirates. Their eyes meet. She looks at him,
pleadingly.

                    MILT
              (checks his watch)
          We got to out him now if we're
          going to make the show. Though I
          would love to watch this play out.

                    TED
          Uh... I was thinking, maybe
          something a little more dramatic.

Milt looks intrigued.

          Are you aware that marijuana isn't
          even legal yet?

                    ROD
          Look, I know what I'm doing here.

Investors starting heading for the doors.

                    ROD (CONT'D)
          We haven't even gotten to the
          coolest pie chart. Wes please hand
          out the 3-D glasses.

Wes starts trying to hand out 3-D glasses to the departing
guests. Suddenly Ted, dressed as a pirate swings in from off
stage left on a rope.

                    TED
          Avast ye, Ricky Stanicky.

Rod looks at him stunned. The other pirates charge the
stage, swords drawn. The audience stops. Ted turns to them.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          This impostor has hijacked Lambert
          and Lambert and is steering our
          ship into dangerous financial
          waters.

                    ROD
              (low voiced)
          What are you doing?

          Just go with it.

                       ROD
                 (low voiced)
          Why?

                    TED
              (low voiced)
          Because if you don't you'll have
          ruined your greatest performance.

          company.

A long beat.   Suddenly Rod jumps into character.

                    ROD
          How'd ye find me out?

                    TED
          Who offers a pot friendly
          children's book as an investment
          product!?

The audience LAUGHS.

                     ROD
          It'll work, I tell ye.    And so will
          me eeyepo!

The audience LAUGHS again.    The investors murmur starting to
get it.

                    TOYO
          It is a joke. Thank god.

                    LAMBERT
              (still unsure)
          Uh... it's a Vegas thing.

Investors nod their heads appreciatively.    Lambert still
looks nervous.

                    ROD
          You'll never take me alive.

A pirate runs up to Rod. Rod expertly disarms him. Ted and
Rod start to duel on stage. Rod is awesome, he pushes Ted
back to the corner. All five pirates come for Rod at once.

                    TED
          This is the problem with the
          financial markets. People get
          swayed by "big ideas." "Hype."
          "The next big thing" can overwhelm
          even the smartest financial
          thinkers.

Off stage Milt nods to Rod.    Rod disarms all three pirates.

                    ROD
          Avast ye scalliwags.

                    TED
          But at Lambert and Lambert our idea of
          feel good investing isn't some silly
          gimmick.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          Feel good investing is buying products
          that you feel good about because
          you're not going to lose all of your
          money on something ridiculous like a
          housing bond that never pays you back.
          Or a mortgage backed security.
          Fundamentals!

Rod easily disarms the remaining pirates except for Ted. Rod
charges toward Toyo with his sword. Ted leaps from the stage
and runs him through. Rod dramatically falls to the ground.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          At Lambert and Lambert we got your
          back.

Rod flops around still dying. Milt gives him a throat cutting
move.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          And to give you some more of those
          details, here's our CEO Jack
          Lambert.

The crowd explodes in applause. Jack walks up the aisle,
noticeably relieved. Erin beams at Ted. Lambert steps up to
the mic.

                    LAMBERT
          Well that gets the point across
          doesn't it! My sales team. Always
          messing with me.

The crowd applauds.

                    LAMBERT (CONT'D)
          But seriously. Let's talk about
          some solid investment products
          we're going to offer over the next
          few years that will keep pace with
          a down economy. These are --

Ted and Rod walk off followed by the pirates and Milt.

          There is nothing better than live

INT. OFFSTAGE - LATER

The investors are congratulating Rod and Ted and the pirates.
Lambert walks up.

                    LAMBERT
          That was superb. Ted, call me on
          Monday and we'll talk about
          bringing you back to work with a
          big salary bump.
              (to the crowd)
          Let's head over to the hotel for a
          light supper.

The investors spend a moment shaking hands and patting Ted
and Rod on the back. JT and Wes and Erin are in the group.

                    ERIN
          That was amazing.

                    ROD
          It's all happening again. We're
          going to be co-heads of sales.
          with matching corporate cars and...

                    TED
          Rod, it's over. That was the
          performance of a life time right
          there. That last scene was a
          masterpiece. You can't top that.

                    ROD
          It was pretty compelling.

                    MILT
          Totally climactic.

                    TED
          I did that for you. Now do this
          for me. Stop being Ricky Stanicky.

                    ROD
          Is that what you really want?

                     JT
          No.   Definitely not.

                    WES
          Yeah, just do it.

          Please.

                    ROD
              (Rod nods)
          And, fade to black.

Rod bows proudly.

                    ERIN
          It's true what you were saying at
          the office. That's why Ricky's
          presentation was so bad. Because
          he's a complete fraud who doesn't
          know anything about finance.

                    ROD
          My real name is Rod Brickhouse.
          I'm trained in classical theater,
          staged fighting, accents and mime.

Rod quickly makes a box around himself.

                    WES
          That's so fucking cool. Can you
          show me how to suck in my testicle
          like you did?

                    ROD
          I had it removed. Lambert and
          Lambert has superb medical
          coverage.

                    ERIN
          How could you do this to me?

                    ROD
          Erin, a guy like me will do a lot
          for a 164,000 dollars a year and
          the role of a life time.

                    ERIN
          I'm talking to Ted.

                    TED
          I used the Ricky excuse with you
          before I realized how great you
          were. But when I tried to stop, it
          was just too late. All those lies
          just caught up to me. So I brought
          in Rod. But there's one thing you
          need to understand.   I only
          brought in Rod so I wouldn't lose
          you. Because I can't lose you.
          You're the most important thing in
          the world to me.

                    ERIN
          I'd like to believe you Ted.     But
          this is so huge.

                     TED
          I know.   But try.   Please.

           Thanks for saving my dad's company.
           The whole family is very grateful.

Erin exits.

                     ROD
               (teary eyed)
           I thought you had her.

Ted is silent.

                     ROD (CONT'D)
           Ted, I'm sorry it went down this
           way. I wasn't kidding when I said
           I loved you the most of all.

                     TED
           I don't know what to say that.

                     ROD
           Don't say anything.    Just hug it out.

Ted hugs Rod.

                     ROD (CONT'D)
               (sing songy)
           Best friends.

Susan appears with a head of steam staring straight at JT.
Erin turns and walks out. Wes, Susan and JT stand silent for
a beat.

                     JT
           Isn't this great Susan?   Everybody
           telling the truth.

Susan savagely kicks JT in the nuts.

                     SUSAN
           And I was going to let you fuck me
           in the ass at Linens and Things!

Susan walks out.

                                                     FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. BALLET - NIGHT

Ted walks up to the ticket window.

                       TICKET TAKER
          Hey, man.

                    TED
          Did Erin ever pick up the ticket I
          left for her?

The ticket taker checks through a pile of stuff.

                    TICKET TAKER
          Nope. Same as last time.       You want
          to take the extra?

                       TED
          Leave it.     Maybe she'll come late.

Ted walks inside.


INT. BALLET - NIGHT

Ted sits in his seat watching.      The seat next to him is
empty.

Erin walks up. Ted does a double take.       But it's not her,
just a woman who looks like Erin.

                       WOMAN
          Excuse me.

She walks past.    He sighs and watches.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Erin sits at a desk dressed for work.      Her assistant enters
with her mail.

                    ASSISTANT
          You got another tomato.

She hands her an heirloom tomato. A note is taped to it.         It
says, "THERE'S AN EXTRA TICKET FOR THE BALLET AT THE BOX
OFFICE AGAIN TONIGHT... IF YOU WANT. TED."

                       ERIN
          Thanks.

The assistant exits. Erin looks at the note, shakes her head
and tosses the tomato in the trash.
"Ricky Stanicky"        11.13.09       Bushell          106.


She sifts through the rest of the mail. She sees a large
manilla envelope with no return address.

Erin opens the envelope and takes out a letter.   As she reads
the letter we hear Rod's voice.

                    ROD (V.O.)
          My dearest Erin, I can't help but
          thinking I played a small part in
          what happened between you and Ted.
          I just want you to know, that every
          lie Ted told, he told for you.
          I've been around the block a few
          times and there are a few things
          I've learned in this life. One,
          Milt Conrad is a genius. Two,
          "Saint Elmo's Fire" is a truly
          underrated film. And three, Ted
          loves Erin. I know this might be
          hard for you to believe because I'm
          just an off off Broadway character
          actor, and because I pretended to
          be a another person for two months.
          But all I can give you is my word.
          And this.

Erin takes out Rod's iPhone.   A message on the screen reads,
"PUSH PLAY."


EXT. GOLF RANGE - DAY

Ted stands in the pro's box at the end of the range with a
cigarette tucked behind his ear. NICK, 12, also with a
cigarette tucked behind his ear, hits balls. Nick's MOM,
stands off to the side.

                    TED
          Better. Now I want you to relax
          your hands more. Just let the club
          do the work.

Ted uses his club to roll another ball in front of Nick.
Nick hits a decent shot.

          There you go. Okay, time's up.

Nick and Ted bro-shake and Nick exits. Ted starts to walk
off the tee.   A golf course manager, DAVE, 40's walks up to
him.

Dave looks down at a blackberry.

                       DAVE (CONT'D)
             Name's uh... Ricky Sta-nicky?       Did
             I type that right?

                       TED
             Oh Jesus. Tell Booker to cover for
             me. I gotta run.

Ted starts to walk away.

                        DAVE
             What's the big deal?      She's here
             right now.

Ted stops.

                          TED
             She?

He turns back and sees Erin standing in the stall. In her
cutest golf outfit. She waves shyly. He approaches her.

                          TED (CONT'D)
             Uh... hey.     Nice fake name.

                       ERIN
             You made it up.

                       TED
             It was kind of a group effort.

             Why'd you come back?

                       ERIN
             Who said I'm back?     I'm just here
             for a lesson.

                        TED
             Oh okay.   Grab the five iron.

She grabs her club.       He pushes a ball to her feet on the mat.

                       ERIN
            My Dad would love to have you back
            at work. He still doesn't
            understand why you never took up
            his offer.

                      TED
            That's not me. The only reason I
            worked there in the first place was I
            thought I wouldn't be good enough for
            you if I was some loser golf pro.

                      ERIN
            That's pretty dumb.

Ted nods.

                      ERIN (CONT'D)
            Look, I got your messages. I know
            about the ballet. But that's not
            why I came.

                      TED
            Was it the tomato?

Erin takes out Ricky's iPhone. She pops in the headphones
and holds up one ear bud to him while she puts the other in
her ear. He pops it in. She pushes play.

                      TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                (pre recorded)
            Yeah she's awesome. She's the best
            thing that ever happened to me.
            She's smart and funny and beautiful
            and so cool. It's weird. I spent
            most of my life using Ricky to
            ditch my girlfriends so I could
            hang out with my boys. But after I
            got to know Erin, I realized if I
            could, I would've used Ricky to
            ditch my boys and hang out with
            her. I've never felt that way
            about any woman before.

                      ERIN
            You might have told a lot of lies,
            but that... that feels true.

            It is true.

          Always.    I'll never get over you.

                    ERIN
          Good answer.

Erin kisses Ted.    Suddenly her phone DINGS.   She pulls away.

                    TED
          What's wrong?

She looks at her phone. ON SCREEN is a calendar reminder.
It reads "BARBARA'S BABY SHOWER".

                    ERIN
              (annoyed)
          I gotta go to San Diego for my
          college roommate's annoying baby
          shower. I should've left already.

                    TED
          Go. I'll call you tomorrow.     We'll
          have dinner.

Erin picks up the phone and dials.

                    ERIN
          I should tell her I'm running late.
              (a beat, to phone)
          Hi, Barb.
              (a beat, listening, Erin
               looks at Ted)
          Uh... look, I'm not going to be
          able to make it. My friend was in
          a terrible accident and I have to
          fly up to San Francisco to see him.
              (a beat)
          Ricky Stanicky...
              (a beat)
          Deep sea fishing accident...
              (a beat)
          Yep, without a life jacket.
              (a beat)
          Thanks so much for understanding.

She hangs up.

                    TED
              (smiles)
          You devious bitch!

                    ERIN
          But that's the last time we ever
          use it.

They share a look. Erin grabs her clubs, puts her arm in
Ted's and they walk off.

                                                  FADE OUT.
