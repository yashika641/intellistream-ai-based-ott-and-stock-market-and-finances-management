     A black and white montage of architectural elements; a flurry

    CLOSE ON -

    A haunted and brutalized young woman, ZSOFIA, is isolated in
    the frame. A vast European landscape can be viewed through
    the casement windows behind her.

                           BORDER OFFICER (O.S.)
                     (Hungarian)
                 Your escort is right outside. She
                 tells us that you are her niece.
                 Are you her niece? Is she your
                 aunt? Where is your mother? Is she
                 alive? Do you know? Do you
                 understand me when I speak? Do you
                 prefer English or Czech?

     No response.

                           BORDER OFFICER (CONT'D)
                 If you are from Budapest as the
                 lady says, may you please state the
                 name and street number of your
                 former place of residence for the
                 record? There's a pen and piece of
                 paper in front of you... If you
                 prefer not to speak to us, we
                 suggest you write it down along
                 with your family name, and we will
                 take it upon ourselves to try and
                 confirm this. Do you remember that
                 address?

    No response.

                           BORDER OFFICER (CONT'D)
                 Is it possible the woman outside is
                 not related to you at all, but
                 simply an ally you made along the
                 way who is trying to help you? You
                 bear little resemblance to one
                 another. We will not punish her for
                 trying to help an innocent young
                 woman. We want to help you get
                 home. Your true home. What is your
                 true home? Help us to help you get
                 home.

              Laszlo, I am alive. Attila tells me
              that you, too, are alive and en
              route to him from Bremerhaven.
              Rejoice!

    It's dark but slowly our eyes adjust like a developing
    photograph hung to dry from a chemical bath.

    A SERIES OF ANGLES -

    Guided by the ocean's current beneath them; slumbering men,
    women, and children rock back and forth in their bunk beds.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                  (Hungarian)
              I cried out in ecstasy to have news
              of you. Zsofia is with me though
              she is frail, strange and quite
              ill. We anxiously await our being
              repatriated, but recently she has
              not been herself which has, in
              turn, roused unnecessary suspicions
              with local officials.

    CLOSE, ULTRA-BOWED LENS ON -

    LASZLO TOTH, malnourished with a badly broken nose. He has
    the face of an emigrant.

    A door opens off-screen and light pours in. Several bodies
    wipe the frame. A fellow HUNGARIAN REFUGEE shakes LASZLO by
    his shoulder. LASZLO slaps his hand in response, shooting
    upwards violently.
                        HUNGARIAN REFUGEE
                  (Hungarian)
              Documents...

    LASZLO regains composure, wipes sleep from his eye. The light
    blooming from off-screen is transcendent.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                  (Hungarian)
              Fortunately, a few Soviet boys have
              taken a liking to us. They pity
              your poor niece especially who has
              grown fuller, even lovelier, since
              you last set eyes on her. These
              lonesome young servicemen are
              ostensibly entranced by such a
              radiant creature's commitment to
              absolute silence.
                                                                 3.

    LASZLO searches for his things in a panic.    He looks to the
    man off-screen.

                        LASZLO
                  (Hungarian)
              WHERE ARE MY THINGS?

                        HUNGARIAN REFUGEE (O.S.)
                  (Hungarian)
              WHAT?

                        LASZLO
                  (Hungarian)
              IT IS NOT AMUSING TO ME! WHERE IS
              MY LUGGAGE?!

    LASZLO pushes the man off-screen who breaks into a fit of
    laughter.

                        HUNGARIAN REFUGEE
                  (Hungarian)
              Oh, stop it! Don't look at me that
              way, old man! It's tucked there
              under the mattress!

    LASZLO ducks down to find a large canvas bag and pulls it
    out.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                  (Hungarian)
              The Soviets have helped us relocate
              to a nearby shelter for displaced
              persons near Vas. They encourage us
              to "enjoy our freedoms," but I am
              reminded of Goethe; "None are more
              hopelessly enslaved than those who
              falsely believe themselves free!" I
              make no mistake, we are not yet
              free.

                         HUNGARIAN REFUGEE
                  (Hungarian)
              Hurry Laszlo, or we'll be last in
              the queue.

    LASZLO and the refugee fight their way through the crowded
    space towards the increasingly overwhelming sunlight,
    throwing off our camera's white balance.

                         ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                   (Hungarian)
              You, like myself, must be
              envisioning so many terribly awful,
              awful things but it is better that
              your thoughts not get the best of
              you.

    They squeeze through a narrow doorway and up three flights of
    stairs.
                                                                4.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
              It is neither better, nor worse
              than you might imagine. I have kept
              myself mostly to myself. More
              importantly, I have defended Zsofia
              from unwanted advances.

    The ferocious energy builds to a crescendo.

    The two men reach the top of the stairwell to the upper deck
    where dozens of immigrants take their place.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
              Below is the address I am told for
              mail in Vas. Please write to me at
              once when you have received this.

    The camera whip-pans over and up to the Statue of Liberty at
    a peculiar LOW-ANGLE.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                  (Hungarian)
              I am certain now that there is
              nothing left for us here. Go to
              America and I will follow you.

    LASZLO and the man beside him squeeze each other by the arm.

                        ERZSEBET (V.O.
              Faithfully, Erzsebet.

    CUE: Strings and tympany reach a climax.

    A woman performs intense oral sex on the HUNGARIAN REFUGEE
    who leans against an armoir in the background. In the
    foreground, a PROSTITUTE knelt on the floor tries to arouse
    LASZLO, though his penis remains flaccid in her grip.
                                                            6.

                    PROSTITUTE
          Don't you think I'm beautiful?

LASZLO appears stoic, uncomfortable, or perhaps somewhat
conflicted.

                      LASZLO
          I do-

                    PROSTITUTE
          Which parts of me do you find most
          beautiful? Is there a part of me
          you would especially like to touch
          or look at?

                    LASZLO
          -all parts.

                    PROSTITUTE
              (affects seduction)
          Stop it. I don't find all the parts
          of you beautiful. There are some
          parts of you which I like very
          much.

                      HUNGARIAN REFUGEE (O.S.)
          Fuck her!

LASZLO's girl is annoyed at his friend's outburst.

                    PROSTITUTE
          Can you tell your friend to be
          polite?

LASZLO shouts back in Hungarian.

                    LASZLO
              (Hungarian)
          Keep your mouth shut.

                    PROSTITUTE
          Which parts do you find ugly?
She's moved to LASZLO's neck to try kissing him romantically.
Still, no response.

                    PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)
          My breasts?

                    LASZLO
          No, they are beautiful.

                    PROSTITUTE
          My legs? Are they too thin?

LASZLO struggles to find the correct adjective in English.

                    LASZLO
          You are- well-proportioned.

He squeezes her thighs below frame.
                                                              7.

                        PROSTITUTE
              Well-proportioned? Well, I think
              that just made my day.

    She presses harder now against him.

                        PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)
              My arse; is that what you like? You
              think it's beautiful?

              Very... It's the space above your
              brow for me which is the problem-

    She stops, taken aback.

                           PROSTITUTE
              What?

                        LASZLO
              That's something I do not like.

                        PROSTITUTE
                  (without affect)
              Your face is ugly.

                        LASZLO

     stops. They embrace each other like brothers and LASZLO steps
     on-board leaving his friend behind him.

     LASZLO rests his head against the frosted window.

     LASZLO'S VIEW FROM BUS WINDOW -

     A heavy snow comes down on LASZLO's cousin, ATTILA, who
     stands amongst a group of on-lookers awaiting visitors
     expectedly.


     EXT. BUS / DOWNTOWN PHILADELPHIA - MOMENTS LATER
13                                                                13
     ATTILA holds his blood relative in an intense embrace.

                         ATTILA
               Cousin.
                                                                  9.

                         LASZLO
               Cousin.

                         ATTILA
               Erzsebet is alive.

     LASZLO's knees buckle, deeply moved.

                         LASZLO
               What did you say?

     ATTILA switches to Hungarian.

                         ATTILA
                    (Hungarian)
               I have a letter from her - your
               Erzsebet is alive and she is with
               little Zsofia.
     LASZLO lets out a deep emotional wail and holds his blood
     relative tight in his arms.


     INT. FURNITURE SHOWROOM - LATER
14                                                                14
     TRACK WITH -

     ATTILA and his young American wife, AUDREY, show LASZLO
     around the shop. ATTILA rambles nervously.

                         ATTILA
               It's a combination of things. Most
               popular is the cabinetry which we
               do ourselves, custom-to-order. The
               lamps too. Some pieces we've found
               and restored. Audrey does the
               displays.

     LASZLO nods, still visibly moved by the news of his wife. Not
     betraying much enthusiasm, he turns to AUDREY.

                         LASZLO
               He speaks like an American from the
               television now-

                         AUDREY
                   (demure, posh, defiant)
               Well, we don't have a television
               but he's been here since before I
               was born and still doesn't sound
               like any American I've ever met.

                         ATTILA
               Eight years ago, we tried opening
               something similar in Manhattan but
               we lasted just two months.

                         AUDREY
               We couldn't compete with the name
               brands.
                                                            10.

                      ATTILA
            Newlyweds come in with an issue of
            Better Homes and Gardens and say,
            "We'd like that table next to the
            perfume ad."
He exhales demonstratively.

                      ATTILA (CONT'D)
            We'd say to them, "well, we can
            make you something like that." And
            they say, "no sir, we want exactly
            that!" Turns out that we don't like
            New York at all. No charm, right
            Audrey?

She nods.

                      ATTILA (CONT'D)
            Every little urchin you come across
            - seller, buyer, delivery boy - is
            running a hustle.

ATTILA arrives at a door at the back, and sorts through a
ring of keys without looking at LASZLO.

                      AUDREY
            I'm from Connecticut myself. Do you
            know it?

Before LASZLO can respond...

                      ATTILA
            Audrey, of course he doesn't know
            it. He just got here.

ATTILA opens the door and flips on a light. The bedroom set-
up is makeshift and austere.

                      ATTILA (CONT'D)
            I cleared out some space for you in
            the back. Audrey made you a bed.
            There's just the cot and the lamp
            for now but feel free to take
            anything you want from the
            showroom.

                      LASZLO
            That's all I need.

Anxious and embarrassed, ATTILA continues on yammering.

                      ATTILA
            For the employee restroom, you just
            exit the front door, and walk
            around back where I parked the car.
            There's a staircase there, it takes
            you up to our apartment. If you
            need anything just knock.

The three of them don't bother stepping inside so ATTILA
shuts the door and leads them around the shop's interior
perimeter.
                                                            11.

                    AUDREY
          You know, we know somebody, who can
          take a look at your nose.

                    LASZLO
          I thought- maybe no one would
          notice.

LASZLO smiles a little, having tried to make a joke with
almost no inflection.

                    AUDREY
          What happened, if you don't mind my
          asking?

ATTILA shoots her a look. LASZLO struggles a bit with the
language speaking slowly, methodically.

                    LASZLO
              (anecdotal)
          I jumped from a rail car. A few
          moments later there was a loud
          cracking sound so I thought I had
          been shot in the head- but I had
          merely run into the branch of a
          tree. No one was running after me.

AUDREY and ATTILA aren't sure how to respond.

                     LASZLO (CONT'D)
          I take something for the pain but I
          would like to have it looked at.
          Thank you.

                    AUDREY
          I'll give Kenneth a call.

ATTILA puts his arm around LASZLO and guides him away from
AUDREY to an office area in the showroom's back corner.

                    ATTILA
          Come and take a seat at my desk.
ATTILA takes the boss' chair. LASZLO sits across from him
like it's a job interview.

                    ATTILA (CONT'D)
          Is it smaller than you expected?

                      LASZLO
          What?

                      ATTILA
          The shop.

                    LASZLO
          No, not at all. I had no
          expectation.

LASZLO analyzes ATTILA's business cards which read: MILLER &
SONS.
                                                  12.


                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          Who is Miller?

                    ATTILA
          I am Miller.

                    LASZLO
          You are Molnar.

                    ATTILA
          Not anymore.

                    LASZLO
          No Miller, No Sons.

                    ATTILA
              (shrugs)
          Folks here like a family business-

ATTILA offers LASZLO a cigarette.

                    ATTILA (CONT'D)
          So, what do you think?

                    LASZLO
          Of the furniture?

                    ATTILA
          Well, I meant of everything so far -
          Philadelphia - but sure the pieces
          on the floor also...

                    LASZLO
              (blunt)
          They are not so beautiful.
ATTILA looks a little hurt but saves face.

                    ATTILA
          That's what you're here for,
          Maestro.

ATTILA lights his cigarette.

                    ATTILA (CONT'D)
          Next month, I can put you on the
          payroll. You're welcome to eat with
          us upstairs on Sundays.

                    LASZLO
          You and your wife have done quite
          enough.

                    ATTILA
          Don't mention it.

                    LASZLO
          No, I do mention- thank you,
          Attila.
                                                                     13.

     LASZLO motions to AUDREY.

                            LASZLO (CONT'D)
                      (Yiddish)
                  Gentile? (Goy?)

     ATTILA nods.

                            ATTILA
                  She's Catholic.

     Corrects himself.

                            ATTILA (CONT'D)
                  We are Catholic.

     CLOSE ON -

     Under the glow of lamp light, ERZSEBET's letter in Hungarian
     reads...
     Laszlo, I am alive. Attila tells me that you, too, are alive
     and en route to him from Bremerhaven. Rejoice! I cried out in
     ecstasy to have news of you...

     The note trembles in LASZLO's withering hands. Off-screen, he
     can be heard again weeping. He strokes the text lovingly and
     murmurs its text to himself. He sets the note down and begins
     sketching the first lines of an architectural drawing.

                            LASZLO
                      (murmurs)
                  Erzsebet...

     CUE: Solo piano concludes.

     EXT. OLD CITY CHURCH SOUP KITCHEN - MORNING
16                                                                       16
     A new season has arrived. Pigeons are everywhere and rain
     drizzles down on a long queue of impoverished families
     waiting on line for food. We pan across to LASZLO who stands
     solo amongst the families in line. His nose has healed
     somewhat.

     A man in uniform stands ahead of LASZLO playing "I Spy" with
     his little boy. He will come to be known later as GORDON.

                            GORDON
                  It's your turn now, William.

     The boy, WILLIAM, has his eyes locked on LASZLO.

                            WILLIAM
                  I spy- with my eye- something-
                  blue.
                                                              14.

     GORDON turns around and regards LASZLO.

                         GORDON
               Is it this gentleman's coat?

                         LASZLO
               He is clever- there is some blue in
               it.

     LASZLO grins in acknowledgement. A volunteer shouts out...

                         VOLUNTEER (O.S.)
               Kitchen's closed, folks! Get back
               early tomorrow.

     The crowd hollers with disappointment.

                         GORDON
               Wait, hold on! I got a kid here!
     The disgruntled VOLUNTEER shouts back.

                         VOLUNTEER
               We're fresh out! Come see me early
               tomorrow and I'll make sure he gets
               a plate.

     LASZLO joins in.

                         LASZLO
                   (shouts)
               You must have a slice of bread-
               he's only a little boy!
                         VOLUNTEER
               How many more times do you all want
               me to say it?! There's nothing left
               here!

     GORDON regards LASZLO.

                            GORDON
               Thank you-

                         LASZLO
               Will he be all right-?

                         GORDON
               There's somewhere else we can try
               tonight.

                         LASZLO
               Let him sleep tomorrow. I can be
               here early to- hold a place.

     LASZLO holds a leather strap for balance in a packed tram
     car. He regards a woman's purse in front of him. After a
     moment, she exits.
                                                                 15.

     LASZLO shifts around as a new group of pedestrians come
     aboard. Two well-dressed businessmen enter and stand to his
     left. The train begins to move. With each sharp turn, the
     passengers lean with the train.

     LASZLO's left hand enters the business man's coat pocket but
     quickly recedes with nothing in its grasp. His expression is
     grave, debased. He makes a decision and slowly re-positions
     himself to the other side of the two men.

                               LASZLO
                  Excuse me.

     He waits for the tram to make another sharp turn, and as it
     does....

     LASZLO's right hand enters the businessman's coat pocket. He
     quickly pulls it back with something in his grip.

     LASZLO hesitates to look down and see the fruit of his labor.

     CLOSE ON -

     He opens his hand to reveal a soiled tissue.

     LASZLO sits for a service, a kippah atop his crown.

                            CHAZZAN (O.S.)
                      (Hebrew)

                  holy Seraphim who thrice repeat
                  "holy" unto You, as it is written
                  by Your prophet: And they call one

                             LASZLO
                      (Hebrew)
                  Holy, holy, holy is the L-rd of

                  His glory.

     LASZLO approaches RABBI ZUNZ in a greeting processional.

                  Boker tov. Rabbi Zunz-?

                               RABBI ZUNZ
                  Yes?
                                                              16.

                         LASZLO
                   (discreet)
               My niece and wife- I have learned
               the two are stuck at the Austrian
               boundary-

     RABBI ZUNZ understands.

                         RABBI ZUNZ
               Wait not many minutes for me and we
               can speak after. Mikveh Israel can
               try and help but from here it is
               very difficult, as you know-

     LASZLO nods graciously and extends a hand in thanks.

     A SERIES OF ANGLES ON -
     LASZLO's meticulous process as he constructs a chaise lounge
     and 2 tubular metal Bauhaus style chairs.

     - Sparks illuminate LASZLO's face as he presides over two men
     welding a few pieces of metal together in a garage. ATTILA
     assists them.

     - LASZLO feverishly pencils a drawing.

     - Pan up an elegant S-shaped plank of soft wood.

     - Inside, with the precision of a tailor, LASZLO measures a
     strip of leather for the chair back.

     - ATTILA pulls the leather down, and the two stand back to
     observe the object which appears somehow incomplete.

     - Pan across other masterful drawings which are carelessly
     strewn about.

     The flow of work and ideas for a wide variety of different
     objects appears infinite.

     AUDREY observes LASZLO's two finished chairs and a functional
     utilitarian shelving unit in the shop front display. She
     paces back and forth on the sidewalk.

                         AUDREY
               Well, I'm not sure what to do with
               them is all.

     She bites her lip.

                          AUDREY (CONT'D)
               What do you think I should pair
               them with?
                                                              17.

                           LASZLO
               Leave it-

                           AUDREY
               How?

                         LASZLO
               Leave it like that.

     AUDREY reaches a conclusion.

                         AUDREY
               They look like tricycles.

     LASZLO looks a little puzzled.

                         LASZLO
               What's that?

                         AUDREY
               A bike for kids.

     LASZLO shaves himself with a straight blade. As he does, he
     charmingly practices an embellished American accent in the
     mirror.

                         LASZLO
                   (emphasizing his R's)
               Peter Piper picked a peck of
               pickled peppers. Did Peter Piper
               pick a peck of pickled peppers? If
               Peter Piper picked a peck of
               pickled peppers, where's the peck
               of pickled peppers Peter Piper
               picked?

     LASZLO exits the bathroom with a towel around his neck and WE
     TRACK with him down the sidewalk. When he reaches the front
     of the building, as he rounds the corner, he bumps into
     ATTILA who grabs him by the arm.

                         ATTILA
               Get over here.

     We follow behind them urgently...

                          ATTILA (CONT'D)
               We have an important customer
               inside; furnished him a two-story
               office space downtown on the cheap
               last year. He's interested in us
               doing some built-in work at a
               residence.
                                                              18.

     HARRY LEE VAN BUREN, 30s, handsome, smokes in an office chair
     towards the back of the shop. ATTILA hurries back to his
     desk. LASZLO, still holding a razor blade, follows behind
     him.

                         ATTILA
               Mr. Van Buren, this is my cousin,
               Laszlo.

     LASZLO nods.

                         HARRY LEE
               Please - that's what people call my
               father. Call me Harry.

                         ATTILA
                   (to LASZLO)
               Harry would like some shelving
               units installed over at his
               family's property in Doylestown.

     HARRY addresses the blade in LASZLO's hand.

                         HARRY LEE
               Sorry to interrupt.

                         HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
               I hoped someone might follow me out
               there to take a look at my father's
               study. My sister and I'd like to
               surprise him by turning it into a
               proper library.

                         LASZLO
               How do you mean?

                         HARRY LEE
               -place is in complete disarray; a
               whole mess of books and paperwork
               so I guess we'd just like some tall
               shelves and cabinetry installed?
               Maybe make him a ladder with little
               wheels on it, you know, like you'd
               see in a real library? He's a
               voracious reader.

                         ATTILA
               We can make you something like
               that. Let me have Audrey come down
               to keep an eye on the place. I'll
               pull the van around.

                            HARRY LEE
               Fantastic.

     Asphalt rushes at us. The road bends and curves.

     In the front windshield's reflection we view HARRY LEE's
     sports car as it speeds with thrilling abandon down the local
     county roads.

                            ATTILA
                  They've got something like nine
                  hundred acres out here, I'm not
                  kidding. A few buildings downtown
                  too- one of them's a department
                  store.

                            LASZLO
                  They pay you well?

                            ATTILA
                  On the last job, they paid okay.
                  They took on a lot of pieces
                  though. Kept adding to the order.
                  Even at a discount, it adds up...
     ATTILA references HARRY LEE's sports car.

                            ATTILA (CONT'D)
                  His old man got flush adapting
                  production techniques to expedite
                  the manufacturing of cargo ships
                  during the war.

     ATTILA struggles to keep up in his van.

                            ATTILA (CONT'D)
                      (shouting at the window)
                  Christ, is this guy trying to shake
                  us? Does he think he's in a drag
                  race? Come on, already!

     HARRY LEE opens a gate and waves them past.

                      (shouts)
                  Stay left until you see the main
                  house. You can park wherever you'd
                  like.

     ATTILA turns his clumsy green Bedford through the front

     driveway.

     We are tight on LASZLO as he moves through the house. He's
     led by his cousin and HARRY LEE. LASZLO takes note of various
     modernist sculptures on pedestals around the entryway.

                         HARRY LEE
               I do appreciate you coming out here
               on such short notice, gentlemen.
               Father's away only until next
               Friday so I was anxious to pin this
               down.

                         ATTILA
               It's no inconvenience for us,
               chief.

     They turn a corner and ATTILA shoots a glance at LASZLO.

                         ATTILA (CONT'D)
               It's your lucky day too cause my
               cousin here is a licensed
               architect, and a specialist in
               renovations... He's even designed a
               library before, back at home. I
               mean, a whole city library.

                         HARRY LEE
               What city is that?

     LASZLO speaks...

                           LASZLO
               Budapest.

                         HARRY LEE
                   (cheerful)
               I see. Never been.

     HARRY LEE pushes a door open to reveal a dark, octagonal-
     shaped study framed by heavy curtains drawn to cover the
     floor-to-ceiling windows.

     Only a small shaft of light is allowed in through the corbel
     glass dome above. Hardbound books are stacked on and
     scattered across Van Buren's desk, floor space, and the
     existing two meter high bookshelves.

     HARRY LEE pulls a curtain aside flooding the room with light.
     Particulate floats all around him.

                         HARRY LEE
               Don't mind the mess.

     LASZLO and ATTILA observe the space.
                                                         21.

                    HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
          I'm thinking... Shelves up to the
          ceiling, and some good reading
          lamps. Perhaps some wall fixtures
          that extend? Father always keeps
          the curtains drawn.

                    LASZLO
          -to protect the books from the
          sunlight. We are south-facing here.

                    HARRY LEE
          Sure.

                    ATTILA
          What's your budget?

                    HARRY LEE
          What's your estimate?

                    LASZLO
          Depends on the materials.

                    HARRY LEE
          Well, make it of reasonable
          quality. Maybe a nice place for him
          to sit and read, as well? A good
          chair or bench for him against the
          window?

LASZLO regards the stained-glass dome above. There is an ugly
diagonal crack across it.

                    LASZLO
          Would you like us to replace that?

                    HARRY LEE
          If there's time, why not? A branch
          fell on it during that nasty storm
          last summer; a tropical depression
          they called it.

HARRY LEE stops to think, arrives at a number...

                    HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
          Keep it below six or seven hundred
          dollars, can you? My sister and I
          are splitting it. I don't want any
          unexpected add-ons.

ATTILA masks his enthusiasm.

                    ATTILA
          Don't worry, we'll come in on-
          budget. You want this all done by
          next Friday, you said?

                    HARRY LEE
          Thursday night, preferably. I can't
          be here during the week but the
          staff can let you in, and if
          anything comes up, have them ring
          me at the office.
                                                              22.

                          LASZLO
                   (firm)
               To be finished on Thursday, we need
               extra hands. Including materials
               and glass, eight hundred dollars.


     INT. ATTILA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
31                                                             31
     CUE: Dinah Shore's "Buttons and Bows" plays on the
     gramophone.

     LASZLO sits at a small kitchen table backed up against the
     wall. The overhead lamp makes a dark shadow across his face.
     He watches ATTILA who is wildly drunk, dancing with his tipsy
     wife, AUDREY. He convincingly mouths the lyrics to "Buttons
     and Bows" which makes AUDREY laugh.

                         ATTILA
               Dance with us! Come on! Cut a rug.

                         LASZLO
               No, thank you.

     ATTILA pulls open his sweaty collar, grabs an apron, wrapping
     it around his waist like a dress and continues mouthing
     Dinah's lyrics.

                         ATTILA
               Don't be a spoiled-sport!

                          LASZLO
                   (smiles)
               I'm not sure what that is but no
               thank you.

     CUE: The track comes to an end.

                         ATTILA
                   (to Audrey)
               Flip it for the other side-

     ATTILA catches his breath.

                         ATTILA (CONT'D)
               You should have seen him talking up
               the price today! I was ready to
               settle at 450.

                         LASZLO
               I wasn't doing that. I was just
               telling him how much it will cost.

     To AUDREY...

                         ATTILA
               I thought he was about to blow it
               for us!

     To LASZLO...
                                                           23.

                    ATTILA (CONT'D)
          I did! I honestly did! I thought
          you were going to completely blow
          it but you held your ground. That's
          what makes you a professional.

LASZLO appears embarrassed.

                    LASZLO
          Hopefully, it's not only that-

ATTILA turns to AUDREY, playfully turning the screws on her.

                    ATTILA
          You know, Laszlo's bride was a goy,
          too, when they met, but she
          converted for him-

AUDREY rolls her eyes.

                    AUDREY
          I should put a muzzle on you.

A new track comes on.

                    AUDREY (CONT'D)
          Oh! This is my favorite.

                    ATTILA
          Dance with her, Laszlo!

AUDREY looks a little embarrassed.

                    AUDREY
          He doesn't want to.

                    ATTILA
              (drunk and antagonizing)
          Don't keep her waiting, cousin.
          It's her favorite song.

ATTILA's tone has darkened the atmosphere. LASZLO finally
stands and approaches AUDREY.

HANDHELD ON -

LASZLO takes AUDREY by the waist and they sway back and
forth. There's a palpable erotic tension.

                    AUDREY
          You're awfully skinny, aren't you?

LASZLO nods, still swaying rhythmically.

                    ATTILA
          See! It's like riding a bike.

ATTILA wraps his arms around them both and the three sway and
sway.
                                                              24.

     AUDREY longs for LASZLO.

     ATTILA's passed out on the bed.

     The bathroom door is open. LASZLO is hunched over the bathtub
     pissing into it. He sweats profusely.

     A NEW ANGLE reveals AUDREY smoking a cigarette watching him.

                         AUDREY
                   (deadpan)
               You missed the toilet.

     LASZLO finishes and stumbles out.

                            LASZLO
               What-

                         AUDREY
                   (murmurs)
               Better than the carpet, I suppose.

     BEAT.

                            AUDREY (CONT'D)
               When    do you expect your wife might
               join    you, Mr. Toth-? There isn't
               room    for two in that storage space,
               I'll    tell you.

                         LASZLO
               I wish I knew, Audrey. Thank you
               for the dinner.

     An awkward beat passes between them.

                         AUDREY
               Attila's shown me some magazine
               pictures of the projects you did at
               your firm. You're not what I
               expected from what I read about
               you.

     He leans against the door frame, practically trying to crawl
     out.

                         LASZLO
               I'm not what I expected-

                         AUDREY
               I'm sure you could get a job, a
               better job, at a firm here.

                            LASZLO
               I then-
                                                              25.

     He breathes.

                            LASZLO (CONT'D)
                  -would be working- for someone.

                            AUDREY
                  Better than sleeping in a storage
                  closet.

     LONG BEAT. LASZLO understands.

                            LASZLO
                  I'll look for somewhere else to
                  stay. Thank you again for the
                  dinner.

     LASZLO opens the door and exits.

     Next to a two meter tall pile of debris, ATTILA and LASZLO
     craft new units for installation.

     A SERIES OF ANGLES -

     The room is empty. The walls are stripped. The curtains are
     gone. Alone, LASZLO sweeps the floor clean with a broom. He
     stops at the center and regards the space.


     INT. VAN BUREN'S STUDY - NEW DAY
36                                                                36
     BIRDS-EYE VIEW ON-

     LASZLO stands at the center of the room. He is surrounded by
     a few HIRED MEN (one is recognizable from the Old City Church
     Soup Kitchen, GORDON). Each of them are supporting a large
     plywood plate.

                            LASZLO
                  One - two - three!

     The men simultaneously lift the plates, standing them up to
     completely enclose the room in an octagonal shape. At the
     central point of action, it mimics a flower blooming.

     The windows now sealed in darkness, save for the sole shaft
     of light let through the stained-glass dome above.

     CLOSE ON -
                                                              26.

     The rouge tinted light illuminates LASZLO's expression as he
     gazes up at it.

     LASZLO speaks to GORDON and ATTILA.

                         LASZLO
               Set each panel to 45�.

     GORDON mimics LASZLO's instruction.

                            GORDON
               Like this?

                         LASZLO
               Yes, that's right. That looks
               right, doesn't it? The books shall
               fan outwards, you see?

     LASZLO demonstrates with his hands passionately.

                            LASZLO (CONT'D)
               Like so.

                         ATTILA
               All in the same direction?

                         LASZLO
               The long panels, yes. The shelves
               themselves, however, can vary in
               height to accommodate the larger
               volumes our client had been
               stacking on the floor.


     EXT. VAN BUREN ESTATE ROOF - DAY

     HANDHELD ON -

     LASZLO, ATTILA, GORDON, and the other hired hands work on the
     Victorian gabled roof above Van Buren's study. Amongst a
     cobweb of ropes and a makeshift pulley system, the men pull
     the rope taut, painstakingly lifting the detached glass dome
     from the roof of the study with a short crane arm.

     LASZLO directs GORDON who, in turn, directs the rest of the
     group.

                         LASZLO
               Slowly, Gordon. One steady
               movement.

                         GORDON
                   (shouts)
               Slowly, boys!

     The men operate the pulley system successfully lifting the
     dome head from its place.
                                                         27.

                       LASZLO
                 (mutters)
             Left, Gordon. Left. And steady.

                       GORDON
                 (shouts)
             All right, good! Now left. (Beat)
             To the left!

One man manually pushes the base of the crane arm employing
excessive strength, and it suddenly swings out too fast,
hovering over the driveway.

                       GROUP
             Hey, christ, watch out!

The group overcorrect the crane's movement causing the dome
frame to swing back, gaining velocity, in their direction.
The dome hits the corner gutter hard, knocking out one large
panel from its frame.

ANGLE ON -

It shatters in the driveway below.

BACK TO -

                       LASZLO
             No!

LASZLO scrambles across the shingled roof towards the dome
which is stuck at an awkward tilt on the southeast corner of
the mansion.

                       GORDON
                 (shouts)
             I said to be careful, goddammit!

                       LASZLO
                 (shouts re: crane arm)
             Get a hold of that thing!
The group is frozen, spooked. ATTILA calls out...

                       ATTILA
             Everyone all right down there?

                       HIRED MAN
                 (defensive)
             -the glass was already broken.

ANGLE ON -

LASZLO crawls on all fours to the very edge of the roof where
the dome frame is stuck.

                       ATTILA
                 (shouts)
             CAREFUL, LASZLO!

LASZLO tries to dislodge the heavy dome frame which grinds
against the guttering.
                                                              28.

     LASZLO begins to kick at it over and over again. Its an
     increasingly reckless gesture. Finally, after three kicks, he
     successfully dislodges the dome from the gutter which causes
     it to CRASH to the ground. He breathes heavy-

                         LASZLO
               We have a piece of gutter to
               replace now, as well!

     STRAIGHT UP ON -

     The men outside replace the stained-glass with a flat, clear
     circular disk. The image recalls a solar eclipse.

     BIRDS-EYE VIEW -

     An intense spherical shaft of light illuminates the center of
     the room. The bookshelves are now complete, remarkable for
     their geometry. There is no furniture in the room apart from
     a visually-arresting chaise lounge which LASZLO pushes into
     the very midpoint of sunlight.

     LASZLO and ATTILA pull protective linens from the painted
     wall of shelves. Half the room is now filled with Van Buren's
     collection of precious tomes. Several modern lamps on
     scissored extenders poke out in various directions.

     GORDON picks up fragments of stained-glass from the driveway.
     The massive dome frame is plunked down beside him.

     After some time, the headlights of an automobile blind GORDON
     from off-screen as he looks up...


     INT. VAN BUREN'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER
42                                                                42
     The esteemed and handsome, HARRISON LEE VAN BUREN SR.,
     enters the room in a miserly fury. ATTILA and LASZLO stand
     frozen, initially dumbfounded by the intrusion.

                         VAN BUREN
               What's this? What is all this? Who
               has authorized you to come into my
               home and tear everything apart?

     ATTILA blinks.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               Who the hell are you?

                         ATTILA
               Uh... Excuse us, sir. This was all
               supposed to be a surprise.
                         (MORE)
                                                         29.

                       ATTILA (CONT'D)
          Your son, Harry, told us not to
          expect you until tomorrow-

                    VAN BUREN
              (shouting)
          It is a Goddamned surprise! My
          mother, an ailing woman, is sitting
          outside on the driveway too
          frightened to come inside!

                    ATTILA
          We are sorry to have frightened
          her.

                    VAN BUREN
          -we brought her here for some peace
          and respite only to discover a
          strange Negro man roaming around
          our property.

                    ATTILA
          Sir, your son asked us here to redo
          your study into a library.

                       VAN BUREN
          A library?

VAN BUREN looks around.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          The room- it's gutted.

                    ATTILA
          We were just putting everything
          back in its place.

                    VAN BUREN
          You've turned it all inside out.
          How the hell do you know its proper
          place?

LASZLO finally interjects...
                    LASZLO
          We have taken excellent care of
          your things, Mr. Van Buren.

VAN BUREN turns to LASZLO with a daring expression, provoked
by his calm.

                    VAN BUREN
          And who the hell are you?

                    LASZLO
          Laszlo Toth-
                    ATTILA
          Laszlo is a licensed architect. He
          supervised the renovation. And I-
          I've done business with your son
          before. I have a furniture shop,
          Miller and Son's, down in
          Kensington.
                                                                 30.

     VAN BUREN stares, fixated on LASZLO. The two have an
     immediate, adversarial connection.

                         LASZLO
               May I show you around the space,
               sir? Our work lamps aren't doing
               the work we've done here any
               justice.

                         VAN BUREN
               Your Negro is waiting for you
               outside the gates so I suggest you
               pack your things up and leave. I'll
               confirm all this with my son in the
               morning. My mother is sick! She
               needs to be let inside to sleep.

                         LASZLO
               We are finished. That's quite all
               right.

     CUE: A low rumble overtakes the soundtrack.

                                                  CROSS DISSOLVE:

     LASZLO snores in a deep sleep, physically exhausted. After a
     few moments, ATTILA shakes LASZLO awake.

                          ATTILA
               Wake up.

     LASZLO jolts up in fearful defense, but quickly re-gathers
     himself.

                         ATTILA (CONT'D)
               That's a hell of a way to greet the
               day.

     ATTILA lights a cigarette on the edge of his cot.

                         ATTILA (CONT'D)
               Harry Lee called.

     LASZLO sits up against the wall, trying to maintain some
     dignity though caught off-guard.

                         ATTILA (CONT'D)
               He says he won't pay.

                         LASZLO
               For the materials?

                          ATTILA
                   (calm)
               He says we damaged the property and
               I'm lucky if he doesn't take me to
               court.
                                                                 31.

     LASZLO doesn't respond. ATTILA remains calm but his voice
     quivers with emotion.

                          ATTILA (CONT'D)
                You've got nothing to say to that?
                What are you going to do about it?

     ATTILA speaks for a moment in Hungarian.

                          ATTILA (CONT'D)
                    (Hungarian)
                I take you into my home. Into my
                place of business, Laszlo, and this
                is how you thank me?

     LASZLO is again silent.

                          ATTILA (CONT'D)
                You run my clients out the door?
                You make a pass at my wife? She
                told me! Of course, she told me.
                What did you expect?

     Silence.

                          ATTILA (CONT'D)
                Hell, what did I expect? You
                couldn't keep your hands to
                yourself even when we were kids.
                Listen up, I won't tell Erzsi this
                time. I know you've been through a
                lot. That's what I told Audrey,
                too. I'm not going to hurt you, but
                I can't help you anymore either,
                got it?

     LASZLO breathes, defiant.

     Winter has come again. The bell tolls. HOLD, HOLD...

                          LASZLO (V.O.)
                    (in HUNGARIAN)

                I CAN BE REACHED BY MAIL AT A NEW
                ADDRESS... I WAIT FOR YOU. I WAIT
                AND WAIT. DO YOU NEED MONEY? WHAT
                DO YOU NEED?
                YOURS, LASZLO.

     HOMELESS MEN sweep the floor of the shelter.

     The muffled ring of the bell... Homeless families in bunks
     begin to rise from their beds.

     ANGLE ON -

     LASZLO wakes in a bunk clutching a duffle bag that contains
     his few possessions. His beard has grown out.

     ANGLE ON -

     GORDON and his son sleep through the ruckus in the bunk
     across from LASZLO.

                            LASZLO

     GORDON stirs awake.

     GORDON is now dressed in functional garments for the day's
     work. He gently tries to wake his little boy who wants to
     sleep some more.

                            GORDON
                      (whispers)
                  We got to go. I let you sleep in.
                  Time to get up.

     A NUN approaches GORDON.

                            NUN
                  Has Mr. Toth already gone? I'd like
                  a word.

     GORDON moves down the hallway and shoulders open the bathroom
     door.

                            GORDON
                  Laszlo!

     The door opens to reveal LASZLO fiddling to stuff a syringe
     and some barbiturate powder back in its pouch.

                            LASZLO
                  It's for my injury.

     GORDON blinks.

                            GORDON
                  Sister Elizabeth is asking for you.

                         LASZLO
               I will be right there.

     GORDON nods to the junk.

                         GORDON
               Do me a favor and hold off on that
               until we punch out.

     On a second-story high beam, LASZLO spots GORDON, pulling his
     safety leash taut as GORDON leans to wrench several bolts
     below frame. GORDON laughs wildly...

                         LASZLO
               She asked me for my- participation.

                         GORDON
               Like what? They want you to help
               out-

                         LASZLO
               I already help- out. She wants me
               to attend the service on Sundays;
               collect donations.

     GORDON looks back at him, takes a break.

                         GORDON
               And what did you say to her?

                         LASZLO
               I said that I would think about it.

                         GORDON
               That seems fair, no?

     LASZLO shrugs.

                         LASZLO
               I go to- somewhere else.

     GORDON leans down again.

                         GORDON
               Why not ask for a place to stay
               wherever it is that you do go!?

                         LASZLO
               I do not permit my people from home
               to see me as a beggar. Never.

     GORDON playfully sings, in retort.
                                                               34.


                         GORDON
                   (sings)
               A rose must remain with the sun and
               the rain Or its lovely promise

               And my own is you-

     CUE: To Each His Own by Eddy Howard overtakes the soundtrack.

     LASZLO laughs.

                         GORDON (CONT'D)
               Give me a few inches.

     LASZLO cautiously releases six inches of rope. As he does, he
     notices an conspicuous black Cadillac Towncar approaching the
     yard.

     LASZLO shovels aggregate into a cement mixer. GORDON enters
     from off-screen.

                         GORDON
                   (casual)
               There's a son of a bitch here to
               see you.

     LASZLO furrows his brow and looks beyond GORDON to see
     HARRISON VAN BUREN SR. on approach from some distance.

                         VAN BUREN
               Laszlo Toth! Is that you?!

     VAN BUREN appears overjoyed, ecstatic. LASZLO courteously
     stands to receive him, stoic.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               I've been looking for you!

     LASZLO shares a dubious glance with GORDON.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               No wonder you couldn't be found!
               You've grown a beard!

     LASZLO blinks.

                         LASZLO
               What can I do for you, sir?

     VAN BUREN catches his breath in the cold.
                         VAN BUREN
               I'd like to take you for lunch.

                         LASZLO
               We don't break for another 2 hours.
                                                              35.

                         VAN BUREN
               Point out your manager. Let me
               educate him.

     A waitress pours coffee for the two of them and exits. VAN
     BUREN pulls out an edition of LOOK Magazine placing it in
     front of LASZLO.

                         VAN BUREN
               Have you seen that?

     LASZLO squints, shakes his head.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               Well, I can assure you that
               everyone else has... Flip to page
               19.

     LASZLO handles the magazine like a foreign object.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               Where did you study?

                         LASZLO
                   (mutters)
               Bauhaus in Dessau.

                         VAN BUREN
               Bauhaus! How marvelous.

     ULTRA-CLOSE ON -

     A two-page spread on "HARRISON LEE VAN BUREN - THE FORWARD-
     THINKER."

     The large black and white photograph depicts VAN BUREN seated
     in LASZLO's chaise lounge illuminated by the spherical window
     above him.

     A second smaller image depicts VAN BUREN standing against the
     unusual, conceptual shelving units; books fan out around him.

                         VAN BUREN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Read the caption below the
               photographs.

     The caption reads: "Here, Mr. Van Buren is pictured in his
     striking, modern at-home-library; entirely suitable for the
     forward-thinking man."

     CAMERA PANS TO NEXT BLOCK OF TEXT -

     "He established the Van Buren Shipyards, which built Liberty
     ships during World War II, after which he formed Van Buren
     Aluminum and Van Buren Steel.

     Van Buren is involved in various large-scale construction
     projects such as civic centers and dams, and is invested in
     real estate around the globe."

BACK TO -

VAN BUREN who sips his coffee.

                      VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
            So, what do you think?

                      LASZLO
            Looks good.

                      VAN BUREN
            Damn right, it does! Why didn't you
            defend yourself when I came after
            you all like a bat out of hell? I
            am ashamed of my behavior! I called
            that American cousin of yours-

Corrects him.

                      LASZLO
            Attila.

                      VAN BUREN
            Yes, that's right. First, I
            apologized then lauded him with
            praise, however, he quite honorably
            redirected me to you!

VAN BUREN wags a finger at LASZLO.

                      VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
            I've since done my homework...

VAN BUREN pulls out an open folder and places it in front of
LASZLO.

                      VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
            These are yours, yes?

LASZLO leafs through the images in the folder and nods.

                      LASZLO
            Yes.

                      VAN BUREN
            All of them?

                      LASZLO
            Yes.

LASZLO begins to tear up, emotional.

                      VAN BUREN
            I'm sorry, have I upset you?

                      LASZLO
            No. May I keep these?

                      VAN BUREN
            Of course you may.
                                                 37.

                    LASZLO
          I didn't realize these images were
          still available, much less of any
          consequence...

                    VAN BUREN
          They are very artistic.

                    LASZLO
          Better in the real life.

                    VAN BUREN
          You could have elaborated a bit
          more on your background! You didn't
          do yourself any favors back there.

                    LASZLO
          It was difficult to interject
          amidst all the shouting-

VAN BUREN smiles.

                    VAN BUREN
          I am ashamed. Really, I am. I acted
          a fool. My mother was dying - and
          it's not an excuse - but she died
          that very weekend at the house.

                    LASZLO
          I am sorry to hear-

                    VAN BUREN
          Tell me - why is an accomplished
          foreign architect working
          construction in Philadelphia of all
          places? What is that you're working
          on anyway? A bowling alley?!

LASZLO chooses his words carefully.

                     LASZLO
          The Reich- rejected myself and my
          colleagues for our type of work for
          it was deemed not Germanic in-
          character.

LASZLO exhales, gravely.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          I don't wish to be rude but I only
          have time for the coffee. You were
          unprepared for what you saw. That
          is understandable. I am glad you've
          come to appreciate it.

                    VAN BUREN
          I don't just appreciate it Mr.
          Toth; I cherish it.

VAN BUREN ignores LASZLO's wish to leave.
                                                            38.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
              (waxes)
          I hate surprises. My fatheaded son
          should have known better, but
          listen, I haven't come here to
          boast or to grieve, I've come to
          pay you the monies you are owed.

VAN BUREN hands him an envelope for dramatic effect.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          For what it's worth, it was not my
          suggestion that you and partners
          should not be paid. I only found
          out about all that after the fact.

                    LASZLO
          We damaged some guttering which we
          planned to replace. There was a
          misunderstanding.

                    VAN BUREN
          Enough of that. Take the money.

                       LASZLO
              (nods)
          Thank you.

                    VAN BUREN
          I'd stash that in your
          undergarments or inside of a shoe.

LASZLO takes the envelope and starts to slide out of the
booth but VAN BUREN takes his hand.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I'd like you to come and see it...
          In the daylight.

                    LASZLO
          I've seen it.

                    VAN BUREN
          I'd like you to come and enjoy it,
          rather.

                       LASZLO
          All right.

                    VAN BUREN
          Wonderful. I can send a car for you
          on Sunday morning if you aren't too
          busy. Write me down your address?

LASZLO writes it down.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I've found our conversation
          persuasive and intellectually
          stimulating.

LASZLO looks at him, incredulous.
                                                              39.

                         GORDON
               They can wait...

     GORDON puts a leather pouch in his mouth and lets it unroll
     to his chest.

                         GORDON (CONT'D)
                   (through gritted teeth)
               Pull that out.

     LASZLO pulls out an antiquated looking syringe.

                         LASZLO
               Jesus, Gordon.

     The coconspirators laugh, having a great time. GORDON spits
     the pouch from his mouth and LASZLO extends the spoon to
     GORDON.

     CUE: The live music plays in ultra slow-motion.

     LONG LENS ON -

     The two of them are now accompanied by some attractive
     looking strangers. A woman kisses at LASZLO's neck but he
     tries to focus on the music.

     WE PAN DOWN to see GORDON blatantly fingering his new
     girlfriend who sits on a bar stool.
                                                              40.

                            BAR MANAGER (O.S.)
                      (shouting)
                  HEY! HEY! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

     LASZLO and GORDON are slow to respond.

                            BAR MANAGER (CONT'D)
                      (shouting)
                  Get the hell out or I'll beat the
                  shit out of you two.

     LASZLO comically vomits on himself where he stands.

                            BAR MANAGER (CONT'D)
                  OH, HOLY HELL. I'm gonna kill that
                  son of a bitch!


     EXT. JAZZ BAR - MOMENTS LATER
55                                                                55
     The BAR MANAGER and a bouncer beat the hell out of LASZLO who
     laughs madly. STEAM RISES from the sewer grates.

     ANGLE ON -

     The crack of LASZLO's nose re-breaking.

                            LASZLO
                  My nose! Damn it.


     EXT. OLD CITY CHURCH - MORNING
56                                                                56
     LASZLO exits, his face battered and nose swollen. He lights a
     cigarette then after a beat, notices VAN BUREN's Town Car
     parked on the corner with the motor running.


     INT. AUTOMOBILE - LATER
57                                                                57
     CLOSE ON -

     LASZLO sits in the backseat of the Towncar taking in the
     fresh country air through an open window. He tries to pull
     himself together.

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
                  There's a pressed shirt and jacket
                  hanging to your left, Mr. Toth.


     INT. VAN BUREN ESTATE DINING ROOM - LATER
58                                                                58
     A Christmas party is in full-swing. LASZLO is shown into a
     dining area where a group of thirty aristocrats have gathered
     for pre-luncheon cocktails by one end of the table.

                            VAN BUREN
                  Ah! There you are! The man of the
                  hour!
                                                                41.

     LASZLO's smashed face peers out of an oversized penguin suit.
     VAN BUREN approaches him, concerned.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                   (hushed)
               What's happened to your face?

                         LASZLO
               Fell off a beam.

     VAN BUREN's son, HARRY LEE, comes up behind his father.

                         HARRY LEE
               Everyone's famished.

                          VAN BUREN
               Harry, you remember each other,
               don't you?

                         HARRY LEE
               I do, yes. Good afternoon.
     LASZLO nods. HARRY LEE's sister, MAGGIE LEE, comes up behind
     her brother.

                         MAGGIE LEE
               Daddy, the kitchen's asking if we
               could please go ahead and take our
               seats.

                         VAN BUREN
               This is Harry's twin sister,
               Maggie.

                         MAGGIE LEE
               Hello, Mr. Toth. We love the
               library.

                            LASZLO
               Thank you.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (to the crowd)
               All right, everyone, let's eat.


     INT. VAN BUREN ESTATE DINING ROOM - LATER
59                                                                59
     LASZLO, who looks a mess, sits in a corner chair between a
     middle-aged couple, MICHAEL and MICHELLE HOFFMAN, and VAN
     BUREN who now sits at the head of the table. VAN BUREN
     brags...

                         VAN BUREN
               He won't tout his own
               accomplishments but Mr. Toth's work
               is celebrated throughout much of
               Western and Central Europe. There
               have been many features about him
               in the architecture journals if you
               follow that sort of thing.
                                                     42.

                    MICHAEL HOFFMAN
          What was your focus?

LASZLO eats somewhat ravenously.

                    LASZLO
          Theaters, synagogues- Restorations.
          Some, quite unusual.

                    MICHELLE HOFFMAN
          Are you married, Mr. Toth?

LASZLO stops eating. It pains him to speak of it.

                     LASZLO
          Yes, but my wife, she- she is still
          in Europe.

                    MICHELLE HOFFMAN
          Why is that?

                    LASZLO
          We were separated. Forcibly.

                    MICHAEL HOFFMAN
          Where is it you come from, if you
          don't mind my asking? I can't place
          the accent.

                    LASZLO
          The city of Budapest.

MICHAEL asides, explaining to his wife...

                    MICHAEL HOFFMAN
          Ravaged during the war- just
          terrible.

                    MICHELLE HOFFMAN
          Oh my, what was it like, the war?
          We hear some stories here that make
          one's toes curl.

                    LASZLO
          I would not know where to begin,
          Mrs. Hoffman.

                    MICHELLE HOFFMAN
          Do you plan on returning to Europe?

                     LASZLO
          She tries to come now, here, to
          join me- but the situation is
          difficult.

                    MICHAEL HOFFMAN
          With Roosevelt gone now that should
          make things easier.
                                                         43.

                    LASZLO
          He is gone, but everyone is still
          frightened that people like me are
          a threat to your national defense-

                    MICHELLE HOFFMAN
          When you say `people,' you mean
          Jews? We're Jewish.

                    MICHAEL HOFFMAN
              (explains dryly)
          Michelle converted.

LASZLO asides...

                    LASZLO
          As did my Erzsebet. It required a
          great deal of commitment and study,
          and yet, few at home recognized her
          for it.

LASZLO japes.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
          A pity the National Socialists
          couldn't see it their way.

LASZLO shrugs off the trauma, as he returns to the track of
their dinner conversation.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
          But not only Jewish. Foreign
          people. I was fortunate to depart
          from Bremerhaven when I did.
          Truman's order facilitated the
          transfer of my group. Others were
          not so lucky.

VAN BUREN finally joins in the conversation.

                    VAN BUREN
          That sounds very painful, Laszlo.
          We are terribly sorry for you.
          Michael is my friend and attorney-
          in that order.

He turns to MICHAEL.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Michael, is this a process your
          firm might help to expedite?

MICHAEL turns to LASZLO.

                    LASZLO
          I'm afraid that it's not so simple.
          My wife cannot leave my niece
          behind because she is young,
          motherless, and very sick.
                                                                 44.

                         MICHAEL HOFFMAN
               It's just the two of them? I'd be
               glad to make an inquiry on your
               behalf. You know, there's something
               called The Displaced Persons Act
               that's recently gone into effect.
               It will allow some 200,000 European
               persons admission for permanent
               residence. You can read about it in
               the paper now.

                          VAN BUREN
               He won't boast but Michael's firm
               represents the office of the Vice
               President.

                         LASZLO
               -president?

                         VAN BUREN
               Of the United States!

                         MICHAEL HOFFMAN
               Come see me in our Philadelphia
               office on Monday.

     MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and hands LASZLO a business
     card.

                         MICHAEL HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
               Telephone this line, and my
               assistant can arrange. She'll tell
               you what we'll need you both to
               provide.

     MICHELLE places her hand on LASZLO's.

                         MICHELLE HOFFMAN
               Michael can help you.

     MICHAEL nods, empathetic.

                          MICHAEL HOFFMAN
                   (Hebrew)
               Bevakasha.

     A SERVER pours wine in VAN BUREN's glass.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (to SERVER)
               We'll take coffee in the study.


     INT. FOYER / STUDY - EARLY EVENING

     CUE: The score broods then gives way to an elegiac piano
     theme.

     ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE ON -

     The light is extraordinarily beautiful. It looks like a Saul
     Leiter picture.
                                                         45.

The aristocrats all chat amongst themselves sipping coffees
and cognac.

NEW ANGLE ON -

LASZLO and VAN BUREN are deep in-conversation sitting in two
chairs the main foyer whiles guests observe the library
nearby.

                    VAN BUREN
              (longing, drunk lucidity)
          I was married once and she gave me
          two beautiful children.
          Nevertheless, my mother Margaret
          and the twins demanded my attention-
          every minute of my scarce personal
          time. Things became awkward between
          my ex-wife and Margaret so we
          separated amicably...

VAN BUREN lights a cigar. He might be drunk.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Margaret raised me on her own in
          Rochester. Just the two of us. Her
          parents had disowned her for "a
          child out of wedlock," so she was
          my only real family, other than the
          twins later on in life, of
          course...

VAN BUREN speaks rhythmically, hypnotically.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I'll tell you, shortly before they
          died, my mother's parents - I
          hesitate to call them my
          grandparents - they reached out to
          Margaret and me after reading an
          article on the reported success of
          my first company.

VAN BUREN asides...

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          In actual fact, we weren't doing
          all that well at the time and would
          soon shutter our doors, but this
          was not yet public knowledge.

VAN BUREN takes a sip of his drink.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          -you might have concluded from our
          prior interactions, I am blunt, not
          hyperbolic or particularly
          sentimental, but my mother was
          defenseless to their chumminess.
          She argued that `they could very
          well be sick or dying," and perhaps
          "they really needed the money..." I
          didn't like seeing Margaret, an
          ordinarily pragmatic person,
          reduced to such bromidic
          assumptions but I agreed to meet
          them in-person;
                      (MORE)
                                                 46.

                      VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          in part, to appease her, as well as
          to satisfy the curiosities of my
          lineage.

A PARTY GUEST comes over and interjects...

                    PARTY GUEST
          It's very clever, isn't it? The way
          the space seems to envelop you.

                    VAN BUREN
          I think so, yes.

                    PARTY GUEST
          It reminds me of a short story I
          read about a never-ending library,
          a labyrinth. Are you working on
          anything at present, Mr. Toth?

                    LASZLO
          A bowling alley.

The PARTY GUEST furrows his brow.

                    VAN BUREN
          Pardon me, but I was just in the
          middle of telling our friend a
          story.

                    PARTY GUEST
          Oh, not at all. Excuse me.

The PARTY GUEST moves on.

                    LASZLO
          You agreed to see them?

VAN BUREN nods.

                    VAN BUREN
          We exchanged pleasantries over the
          telephone and I offered to visit
          them at their modest apartment
          residence in a neighboring town.

VAN BUREN asides...

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I laughed to realize they'd been so
          nearby all those years!

Back to the body of the story...

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          On the drive over, I had time to
          think and finally arrived at a
          figure I felt comfortable offering
          the two of them - seeing that they
          were, whether I liked it or not,
          our only living relatives...
                      (MORE)
                                                 47.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I was received hospitably so I
          swiftly moved to explain that I had
          made them out a cheque for the
          amount of $25,000. When I handed it
          over, they appeared relieved but
          perhaps a little disappointed at
          the figure. They were courteous and
          thanked me, all the same.

VAN BUREN pauses for effect.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I was quite uncomfortable but
          before hurrying off I asked them a
          question; "what will you do with
          all that money?" They rambled on
          about miracles or some such thing.
          For a moment, everything in their
          immediate line of view seemed
          solvable, achievable! They would
          finally be all right. What a
          thoughtful grandson I was!

VAN BUREN smiles.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Upon departure, before I had
          reached the edge of their front
          lawn, the two of them ran out after
          me shouting! - "You've forgotten
          your signature, Harrison!"

VAN BUREN exhales demonstratively.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I summoned the courage to be frank
          and speak to them as adults. I had
          not forgotten, I said, but was
          ultimately not compelled to sign
          due to the blunder of their
          response! If only they'd been sick
          or dying as my mother had
          previously suggested, how glad I
          would have been to ease their
          troubles - but they appeared
          perfectly healthy to me!

VAN BUREN sighs.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          They took it as such a shock that
          for a moment I thought that that
          might kill them right there on the
          front lawn - but the two just wept
          and came apart like beggars... It
          was all much more disturbing than
          I'd imagined it in my head so on
          the condition that they let
          Margaret alone from then on, I
          struck them a separate cheque for
          the amount of $500 and signed.

BEAT.
                                                         48.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          That is how much I loved my mother,
          Mr. Toth. We did things for each
          other!

                    LASZLO
              (deadpan)
          What could they expect after the
          way they had treated you both.

                    VAN BUREN
          Yes, yes, that's exactly how I see
          it.

LASZLO blinks.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          So, answer me one question; why
          architecture?
                    LASZLO
          Is it a test?

                    VAN BUREN
          Not at all.

LASZLO smiles through the pain of his broken nose.

                    LASZLO
              (matter-of-fact)
          Nothing can be of its own
          explanation� is there a better
          description of a cube than that of
          its construction? You know, some
          years ago, in March, a stranger
          knocked at the classroom door of
          the university where I frequently
          lectured. At once, all that was
          familiar and important to us was
          gone. We were too well-known at
          home. I thought my reputation might
          help to protect us but- it was the
          opposite. There was no way to
          remain anonymous; nowhere for my
          family to go.

LASZLO sighs and changes course.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          There was a war on, and yet it is
          my understanding that many of the
          sites of my projects have survived
          and are still there in the city.

He smiles again and continues, choosing his words carefully.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          When the terrible recollections of
          what happened in Europe have ceased
          to humiliate us, I expect them to
          serve instead as a political
          stimulus, sparking the upheavals
          that so frequently occur in the
          cycles of peoplehood.
                    (MORE)
                                                                 49.

                           LASZLO (CONT'D)
                 I already anticipate a communal
                 rhetoric of anger and fear; a whole
                 river of such frivolities may flow
                 un-dammed, but my buildings were
                 devised to endure such erosion of
                 the Danube's shoreline.

     VAN BUREN is intoxicated by LASZLO's response.

                           VAN BUREN
                 What a poetic reply! You must have
                 been a beloved professor! I've said
                 it before but I do find our
                 conversations intellectually
                 stimulating.

     WE PAN UP with VAN BUREN as he rises from his chair to
     address the room.

                           VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                 Everyone, take your brandy and join
                 me outside! I have a fantastic
                 surprise.


     EXT. FOREST TRAIL/ VISTA - TWILIGHT
61                                                                61
     WIDE ON -

     Ghostly silhouettes march across a footbridge near the
     estate.

                           MICHAEL HOFFMAN
                 Where in the hell are you taking
                 us, Harrison?! It's freezing out
                 here.

                           MICHELLE HOFFMAN
                     (laughs)
                 Try doing this in heels, Michael!

                           VAN BUREN
                 Don't be impatient! It isn't far.

     ULTRA-WIDE ON -

     They march on for some time up a hillside, murmuring amongst
     themselves.

     NEW ANGLE ON -

     The path finally opens to a majestic clearing. A large pond
     reflects moonlight and the hillside hovering above it.

     VAN BUREN stops, and turns to his guests. He catches his
     breath. He is visibly intoxicated.

                           VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                 As you all know, these last years
                 have been especially hard on Harry,
                 Maggie, and myself.
                                                         50.

ANGLE ON -

HARRY and MAGGIE give each other a squeeze, a little
embarrassed.

                       MAGGIE LEE
             Daddy, it's very cold out here.
             Shouldn't we go back inside?

BACK TO -

VAN BUREN stumbles but regains composure.

                       VAN BUREN
             Quiet for a moment, Maggie... I
             brought you all here this evening,
             not to glance over my shoulder
             towards the past, but to invite you
             to look forward with me towards the
             future!

He points...

                       VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
             On the other side of that hill is
             Doylestown. It is on this site near
             our own family plot that we plan to
             build a center for the community in
             honor of Margaret Lee Van Buren!

HARRY LEE looks distressed at the announcement.

                       MICHELLE HOFFMAN
             Oh Harrison! How lovely!

The aristocrats clap a little. VAN BUREN continues...

                       VAN BUREN
             This shall be a sacred enough space
             that her soul might inhabit it! A
             place for gathering, learning, and
             reflection-

He places his hand on LASZLO's shoulder.

                       VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
             -and Mr. Toth, I want you to build
             this for her, something boundless,
             something new.

LASZLO blinks.

                        VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
             It's a shock to you I see! I'm
             delighted! I thought you might see
             it coming!

                       LASZLO
             No-

VAN BUREN throws his arm around him and starts walking him
back in the direction they came.
                                                              51.

                         VAN BUREN
               It is no coincidence that fate
               brought us together on the eve of
               my mother's death! I am good at
               reading the signs.
                         LASZLO
               I- I am not sure of what the
               commission entails, sir.

                         VAN BUREN
               We can discuss the details at home.
               You'll be well-compensated and
               provided a place here on the
               property to stay and work. Residing
               here will allow you the time and
               space to properly conceive of it.
               Your family, should they arrive,
               are welcome here, too. What do you
               say?

                         LASZLO
               I would like to draw something and
               present it to you.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (changes gears)
               You'd prefer to win the commission?
               Fine, then do that. It's cold.
               Let's return inside.


     INT. VAN BUREN ESTATE FOYER - NIGHT
62                                                             62
     A grandfather clock ticks. The guests have gone. LASZLO waits
     on a bench under a lamp near the front door. HARRY LEE and
     MAGGIE LEE can be heard having a hushed argument somewhere in
     the house.

                          LASZLO
                   (calls through the house)
               Excuse me!
     No response.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               I wonder if someone can take me to
               the train station before it gets
               too late!

                         HARRY LEE (O.S.)
                   (shouts back)
               Just a moment please!

     A SERVANT enters the foyer with the dirtied table cloth from
     lunch. LASZLO approaches her in the hallway.

                         LASZLO
               Excuse me, sorry. A driver brought
               me here. I don't recall his name-

     She doesn't speak English.
                                                          52.

                    SERVANT
          Sorry, sorry-

                    LASZLO
          I need to get back. Can someone
          possibly contact the man who
          brought me here this afternoon?

                    SERVANT
          Just a minute please...

HARRY LEE enters from behind.

                    HARRY LEE
          Mr. Toth, I'm sorry to have kept
          you waiting.

LASZLO turns to HARRY LEE.

                    HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
          Harrison's gone to bed but he
          wishes you a good night.

Beat.

                    HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
          Listen, I am terribly sorry for my
          father's theatrics. It must have
          caught you off-guard-

                    LASZLO
              (nervous)
          That's all right...

                    HARRY LEE
          He often makes decisions without
          consulting the rest of us.

                    LASZLO
          I did not take any of it- to heart-

                    HARRY LEE
          Oh, but you should. You should, you
          see. My father would like us to
          hire you.

It begins to set in for LASZLO that the offer might be
sincere.

                    LASZLO
              (rambles)
          -but I have no infrastructure here.

                    HARRY LEE
          That's why he's asked me to oversee
          and assist you in this endeavor.

                    LASZLO
          I have no idea of the parameters.
                                                                 53.

                            HARRY LEE
                  Once I have distilled the essence
                  of father's outburst I will try and
                  make some economic sense of it.

     MAGGIE LEE enters.

                            MAGGIE LEE
                  We've quite a full house this
                  evening so I took the liberty of
                  making up a place for you in the
                  guest house. We can have your
                  things sent for in the morning.


     INT. GUEST HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

     SFX: Knock, knock, knock.

     ANGLE ON -

     The view of the estate from the guest house window.

     NEW ANGLE ON -

     LASZLO wakes in a new environment, fully clothed atop some
     freshly ironed linens. Next to him, are all of his
     belongings, fetched and delivered whilst he slept. He quickly
     sorts through his bag to find his sketchbook.

     SFX: Another round of rapping at the door...


     INT. VAN BUREN ESTATE - BEDROOM - LATER
64                                                                64
     A SERVANT mutters something in the hallway then LASZLO cracks
     the door to HARRISON's sleeping chambers.

                            LASZLO (O.S.)
                  You rang for me, sir?

                            VAN BUREN (O.S.)
                  Come in, Laszlo! I've had a vision!

     LASZLO enters with sketches in-hand.

                            LASZLO
                  I have some sketches, also-
                  something I have been working on
                  which might be applicable here, if
                  you care to look-

     A NEW ANGLE reveals VAN BUREN, still in bed, an absolute
     wreck. He wears a sleep mask over his eyes.

                            VAN BUREN
                  Stop! Stop! In a moment! My eyes
                  are bleary! Take a seat!
                                                         54.

VAN BUREN sits up in bed and pushes the sleep mask up to his
forehead. He then drops something into a glass of water
causing it to fizz.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Pardon my appearance, I'll call for
          breakfast. I have some carpenters
          in the forehead causing a terrible
          ringing in my ears so you must bear
          with me-

LASZLO sits in a chair next to the bed.

                    LASZLO
          I can come back-

                     VAN BUREN
          Shh. Shh. Before I lose it. Dreams
          slip away.
LASZLO laughs.

                    LASZLO
          Yes, I know.

VAN BUREN speaks methodically.

                    VAN BUREN
          Doylestown is beautiful but not a
          cultural place, you know?
                    LASZLO
          Sure.

                    VAN BUREN
          But it could be. If there were an
          auditorium, it could host a theater
          festival.

                    LASZLO
          Sure.

                    VAN BUREN
          In the off-season, of course, the
          local students could access it.

                    LASZLO
          Yes.

                    VAN BUREN
          And what do you think of a
          gymnasium? I practiced wrestling as
          a teenager and I have fond memories
          of my mother accompanying me to
          matches in the neighboring towns.

                    LASZLO
          Perhaps a swimming pool?

VAN BUREN shuts this down.
                                                              55.

                         VAN BUREN
               I can't swim.

     LASZLO remains poker-faced.

                         LASZLO
               And perhaps it's too expensive-

     VAN BUREN pats LASZLO's chest affectionately.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (shudders)
               Don't talk to me about money.


     INT. HARRY LEE'S PHILADELPHIA OFFICE - DAY
65                                                             65
     MICHAEL HOFFMAN sits next to HARRY LEE red-lining a contract.

                         HARRY LEE
               Don't talk to him about money. I've
               spoken to our friends at the Bucks
               County Mayor's office who are warm
               to accessing local and state
               funding opportunities, on behalf of
               our project, if we are willing to
               designate a "specific and
               meaningful" component of the center
               for Christian congregation.

                         LASZLO
               It's a community center for all
               people. What do they want? A prayer
               room?

                          HARRY LEE
               I am under the impression they are
               expecting something more specific
               and meaningful than that for their
               earmark. This, and pending their
               approval of the overall proposal,
               of course.

     LASZLO laughs a bit then realizes HARRY LEE is serious about
     this casual new addition.

                         LASZLO
               An auditorium, a gymnasium, a
               library-

                         HARRY LEE
                   (corrects)
               Father described it as more of a
               reading room for the public...

     LASZLO doubles down.

                         LASZLO
               -a library, and a chapel? It's four
               builds, not one.
                                                               56.

                            HARRY LEE
                  It's ambitious. Thought you'd like
                  that... I've put in a call to our
                  frequent contractor, Leslie
                  Woodrow. We first worked with
                  Leslie as one of our Ship
                  Engineering Officers but he's
                  supervised several important
                  construction projects for us since-
                  including these offices. My father
                  is allocating a sum of 850,000
                  dollars for this project which to
                  me seems very reasonable, if not
                  exorbitant. If Leslie agrees to
                  come on-board, I'll have him start
                  a budget for us right away.

                            MICHAEL HOFFMAN
                  This allocation of 850,000 is
                  inclusive of fees for yourself and
                  Leslie... Also, we've gone ahead
                  and made arrangements to start
                  securing you a license here in
                  Pennsylvania-

               Anything linking her to you? I have
               reached out to colleagues who
               sometimes attended parties at the
               house. I am waiting on return.

     LASZLO walks the landscape's perimeter counting each click as
     he pushes along a Surveyor's Wheel. GORDON takes notes beside
     him.

               Whomever comes to mind, write to
               them and explain its urgency.
               Anything tying she to you, and you
               to me, can be of great assistance
               to Mr. Hoffman. I have enclosed a
               list of items and information
               requested by his office. Please
               fill out what you can of these

               Here: some good fortune may have
               fallen upon me. In an unexpected
               turn of events I have been offered
               an intriguing opportunity; a second

               than ever before.

     SFX: A bell chimes three times.

     CLOSE ON -

     "Margaret Lee Van Buren Center for Activity and Creation" is
     scribbled crudely at the top of the coal sketch. The semi-
     abstract drawing gives little indication of what the
     recreation center will actually look like when fully-
     realized. The illustration is more akin to a Jerry Hopper
     lithograph than a traditional architectural drawing.

     LASZLO removes the sheet of paper to reveal another modular
     section of the structure, then a third, and fourth.


     INT. VAN BUREN GUEST HOUSE / DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
72                                                                72
     The living room has been transformed into a makeshift office
     space. By the window stands a drawing table adjusted to
     LASZLO's height. Paper, wooden blocks, and other materials
     are strewn about the room. The shades are removed from the
     standing lamps for better luminance.

     LASZLO stands hunched over the dining room table constructing
     a detailed architectural model.

     A SERIES OF ANGLES -

     - The model: A trapezoidal structure, the centerpiece, sits
     atop the small hill overlooking the lake and a miniature of
     Doylestown on the other side.

     - A cluster of buildings; sloping and irregular triangles
     surround the trapezoid; together they form a perfect
     rectangle.

     - The sharp points of the model rooftops protrude out and up
     towards the sky.

     - LASZLO carefully finishes by placing a small bell tower
     made of bent copper parallel to the model's main structure.


     EXT. VAN BUREN ESTATE FOYER - DAY

     LASZLO and two servants awkwardly navigate the large-scale
     model across the estate's horizon line.
                                                                 59.

     INT. VAN BUREN'S STUDY - LATER
74                                                                74
     LASZLO stands at the center of VAN BUREN's study
     demonstrating his finished model which takes up much of the
     room. HARRY LEE, MAGGIE LEE and LESLIE WOODROW (heavy-set and
     above-average in height) all observe, fascinated.

     VAN BUREN sits behind them all getting a haircut leafing
     through pages and pages of LASZLO's drawings.

                         LASZLO
               The total area is   648 Square
               Meters, including   a sizable
               condensate system   for harvesting
               rainwater for the   boilers below
               grade.

     LASZLO points, gathers himself.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               Narrow openings at the top, as you
               see here and here, are skylights
               that can also be viewed as
               demarcations of units of space on
               either side of the entrance hall.
               Each unit is convertible and multi-
               functional with removable panels
               that hinge open and close. When
               these rooms are combined they
               support a total occupancy of 500
               persons on each side. Bespoke
               systems for seating and storage
               allow for conference, gymnasium,
               auditorium. These rooms of more
               standard size are pre-cast
               concrete. The chapel at the heart
               of the building, however, is a
               perfect sphere, like a grain silo,
               so we'd cast on-site.

     LASZLO stammers nervously.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               The main tower from the ground is
               20 meters tall-

     VAN BUREN swats his BARBER's hand away, annoyed.

                         VAN BUREN
               I can't see!

     HARRY clears his father's vantage point.
                                                         60.


                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Harry, what do you think about the
          gymnasium off to the side like
          that? I had imagined it
          differently.

                    HARRY LEE
          It all looks like an army barracks.

Everyone waits for VAN BUREN's reaction with bated breath.

                    VAN BUREN
          Perhaps that's because you never
          enlisted, Harry. I think it's all a
          great surprise. Carry on, Laszlo.

LASZLO appears a bit insecure. He moves now to a different
model that demonstrates the chapel's interior.

                    LASZLO
          The Chapel's interior is more
          generous in its expression; the
          vernacular concrete contrasted by
          an altarpiece of marble from the
          mountains of Carrara will serve as
          the institute's centerpiece.

LASZLO gestures to the next model.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          And see, let me demonstrate...
          Morning, midday, dusk.

ULTRA CLOSE ON -

LASZLO turns on a small flashlight and holds it at a high
angle close to the model through three entry points of light,
MAGGIE LEE, HARRY LEE and VAN BUREN lean down to look inside.
The light forms a pattern on the floor.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          As the sun moves, east to west...
          Located at the base of the towers,
          wooden beams unite to form a symbol
          of the cross upon the altarpiece.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          Oh, how wonderful! The town is sure
          to be over the moon when they see
          you've kept faith and values at the
          forefront of your design.
                                                      61.


                    VAN BUREN
          Extraordinary. Your grandmother
          loved marble. Maggie will you call
          for some coffee?

                    MAGGIE LEE
          I think it's beautiful, Mr. Toth.

She exits. VAN BUREN looks at HARRY LEE.

LESLIE points at the towers on the right and left.

                    LESLIE WOODROW
              (scoffs)
          What's the height of those things?
          Six or seven meters also? And did I
          understand you correctly? 108
          meters of surface area for the
          facade?! That's eleven square feet,
          If we can afford these materials at
          all, Mr. Van Buren, Sylacauga
          Marble ships out of Talladega
          County and that might be possible
          if I manage to swing some favors
          but I can't make any promises.

                    LASZLO
          Afford these materials? The
          concrete is sturdy and cheap.

LESLIE speaks frankly.

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          The concrete- it's not very
          attractive. Perhaps you'd like to
          split the difference on materials?

                    LASZLO
          Fortunately, the building's
          aesthetic is not yours to resolve,
          Mr. Woodrow. And Sylacauga marble
          is white like a sheet of paper;
          it's nothing. What I have here is
          blue and grey with softer veining.

                    VAN BUREN
          I prefer the Italian, I think. It's
          more suitable, no?

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          I have to do some research but-
                                                            62.


                    LASZLO
          I know someone talented, an Italian
          mason whom I have commissioned
          before.

LESLIE is visibly frustrated.

                    VAN BUREN
          There's one detail before I forget;
          the name. I'd like to place it
          somewhere more visible. What do you
          think?

LASZLO nods, lights a cigarette. MAGGIE LEE enters again
followed by two maids with trays of coffee.

                    MAGGIE LEE
              (to the maids)
          On the table over there.

MAGGIE LEE hands her father a cup and turns to LASZLO.

                       MAGGIE LEE (CONT'D)
          Sugar?

                       LASZLO
          Black.

LESLIE's eyes widen.

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          Sir, is this really what you
          imagined? Am I missing something?
          When Harry called, he described
          this to me as a personal project.
          If this is what we ultimately
          settle on, something of this scale,
          the timeline would need to be
          considerably adjusted.

                    VAN BUREN
          I'd rather be alive at 18% than
          dead at the prime rate, Leslie.

VAN BUREN winks at LESLIE.

                    LASZLO
          We will not exceed our allocation.

                    VAN BUREN
          Harry, where are we in our
          discussions with the Mayor's
          office?
                                                              63.


                         HARRY LEE
               They are waiting on us.

                         VAN BUREN
               Push things along and see where we
               land with them.

     LASZLO and GORDON lie in the same bed, strung out. A needle
     is still stuck in LASZLO's arm. He unties his arm and rips
     out the needle causing his arm to bleed all over the bed.

                         LASZLO
               Shit.

     SFX: BANG, BANG, BANG, again.

     LASZLO shoots up in a panic. He looks over at GORDON.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               Get up.

     LASZLO pulls off a pillow case and wraps it around his elbow.

     EXT. GUEST HOUSE DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
76                                                             76
     LESLIE stands there impatient. After a beat, LASZLO opens the
     door.

                         LASZLO
               Morning Leslie.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               Don't tell me you're just now
               getting up?

                         LASZLO
               Two minutes, and I am ready.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               I'll give you three if you use it
               to rinse off.

                         LASZLO
               Three.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               Let me inside so I can get the
               model on the truck.
                                                              64.

     INT. MAYOR KINNEY'S OFFICE   - AFTERNOON
77                                                                77
     LASZLO, LESLIE, and GORDON clumsily carry in the oversized
     model before MAYOR KINNEY, HARRY LEE and a group of other
     LOCAL OFFICIALS.

                         HARRY LEE
               The Mayor hasn't got all day,
               Leslie.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               We're fine, Harry! Will your father
               be joining us, as well?

     Turns to MAYOR KINNEY...

                         HARRY LEE
               He's overseas on business but he
               sends his regards. This is a
               project he's very passionate about,
               and a priority for us. He asked if
               he could telephone you to talk
               through it all tomorrow - at your
               convenience, of course?

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               Well, sure, Sylvia in my office can
               set for just about any time
               tomorrow afternoon.

                         HARRY LEE
               It will have to be in the morning
               due to the time difference.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
                   (sycophantic)
               Morning then is fine- just fine.
     HARRY LEE and LESLIE are doing most of the talking, trying to
     cover for LASZLO and GORDON's bad state.

                         HARRY LEE
               They only need two minutes to set
               this all up.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               We'll get this set down and start
               right away for ya.

     The three men set the model on the table and it sadly bends
     down over the sides.

                         LESLIE WOODROW (CONT'D)
               You got a stool or something they
               can use to extend?

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               No.
                         LESLIE WOODROW
               All right, then we'll go ahead and
               get started.
                                                                 65.

     A small figurine falls from the base of the model. LASZLO
     bends to the ground, sweating and catching his breath.

                         LASZLO
               Apologies...

     He puts the figurine back in place, uncharacteristically
     loose-limbed.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
                   (re: model)
               This is- different.

                         HARRY LEE
               Very modern, yes.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               All right, well, walk us through
               what you have in mind.

     LASZLO exhales, pulls himself together.


     INT. TOWN HALL - EVENING
78                                                                78
     LASZLO, in formal dress, makes a speech in front of a
     scattered audience. Forty or so townspeople are in
     attendance.

                         LASZLO
               Construction phase alone will
               create upwards of eighty local
               jobs. Carpenters, painters- upwards
               of one hundred and fifty upon
               completion, at which point, the
               facilities will need to be
               permanently staffed.

     A TOWNSPERSON interjects...

                         TOWNSPERSON (O.S.)
                   (calls out)
               When are you going to answer the
               questions in the box?

     LASZLO pauses, thinks, chooses his words carefully so as not
     to offend. He spots VAN BUREN in the crowd. VAN BUREN nods,
     encouragingly.

                         LASZLO
               Yes, I- I would like also to
               address some of the written
               concerns and comments which were
               submitted to us anonymously ahead
               of tonight's discussion; questions
               probing my personal background,
               heritage, and ideological
               persuasion, if you will.

     LASZLO clears his throat.
                                                         66.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          As a foreign person and newcomer to
          Doylestown, I have observed your
          community with a great interest.
          Your town is not dissimilar to the
          one where I myself was raised. Your
          Christian church, not so different
          from the temple of my youth. I see
          your St. Anthony's decaying facade.
          Your school's gymnasium too slight
          for the size of its student body. I
          see a community in need and this is
          my only persuasion of relevance...
          Mr. Van Buren, a generous patron
          and practicing Protestant, and I-
          will build a place where you will
          be drawn to congregate and inspired
          to worship. You may rest assured
          that we will honor the traditions
          of Doylestown long established
          before I ever set foot here.
LASZLO pours himself a glass of water, takes a deliberate
sip.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          I am determined to know and draw
          from your history and kneel upon
          its shoulders. Where does the
          structural fabric of a building
          appear with greater clarity than in
          the buildings of one's forefathers?
          To know and understand its nature,
          I have analyzed the purposes for
          which we build. I have examined
          every function which appears and
          determined its character. I have
          made its character the basis for my
          conception. I see the spiritual and
          intellectual environment of your
          town; The Margaret Lee Van Buren
          Center for Creation and Activity,
          will be its manifestation; a new
          landmark. A landmark which
          proclaims not only "I am new," but,
          "I am part of the new whole."

A SECOND TOWNSPERSON speaks up...

                    TOWNSPERSON 2
          Excuse me, Mr...?

                    LASZLO
          Toth.

                    TOWNSPERSON 2
          Mr. Toth, none of us here are
          familiar with this type of model.
          Can you take us through your plans
          for the Recreation Center in
          Layman's terms? And yes; we are all
          keen to see what you have in mind
          for the chapel, especially.

                    LASZLO
          I've had discussions with your
          Father Graham which informed for me
          the floor plan...
                                                              67.

     LASZLO looks at GORDON and LESLIE.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               Can you pass me the flashlight?

     GORDON has it at the ready. LASZLO moves the piece of model
     to an overhead projector and demonstrates.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
               Here, we have the chapel interior.
               A space suitable for 115 persons.
               At dawn...

     LASZLO shines the flashlight through the southeast facing
     glass which casts a long Sign of the Cross onto the stark
     marble altar piece.

                         LASZLO (CONT'D)
               At sunset...

     LASZLO shines a light down through the slits lined with
     copper creating an enchanting glow. The audience is audibly
     impressed.

     PUSH IN ON VAN BUREN who is situated in the very back of the
     room like a proud parent.

     CUE: The score booms and swells... Tympany patterns.

     EXT. LUMBER YARD/ STEEL MANUFACTURER/ MARBLE QUARRY - VARIOUS
     TIMES OF DAY

     Materials for the construction of the The Margaret Lee Van
     Buren Center for Creation and Activity are prepared around
     the globe.

     A SERIES OF ANGLES -

     - Over dramatic vistas, the sun sets.

     - Steel is fabricated.

     - Wood is cut and piled.

     - Concrete is mixed.

     - Chunks of marble are crudely sawn off in titanic fragments.

                         ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                   (in HUNGARIAN)
               Laszlo! It has taken some months to
               obtain the items which Mr. Hoffman
               requested since receiving your
               letter. I was at first at a loss
               but suddenly thought to contact our
               upstairs neighbor in Buda, Mrs.
               Horvath! She was able to provide me
               with several family photographs
               that clearly picture you, myself,
               and Zsofia with her mother on our
               wedding day!
                            (MORE)
                                                                68.

                         ERZSEBET (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               The poor dear thought us dead all
               these years so had kept them on her
               mantle in memoriam. Zsofia could
               have only been thirteen years of
               age at the time but her face and
               expression are unmistakable. I have
               included all but one in case this
               letter does not reach you. I will
               keep it near my breast, our family
               tree against my heart. Laszlo, does
               this mean we might meet again soon?
               Yours,
               Erzsebet

     The final image in the montage is a photograph of LASZLO and
     ERZSEBET's wedding day. Their entire family is present. They
     look beautiful and happy, frozen in time.

                           5:00 - 0:00


     A yearning, nostalgic piece for piano plays over the

     LASZLO, MICHAEL and MICHELLE HOFFMAN, and MAGGIE LEE wait
     with flowers and balloons at the end of the platform.

     LASZLO is visibly nervous. He's dressed up and shaved clean.

                         MICHELLE HOFFMAN
               Right or left?

                         MICHAEL HOFFMAN
               On the right.

                         MICHELLE HOFFMAN
               Could they have walked past us?
                                                         69.

                       MICHAEL HOFFMAN
             My associate in New York confirmed
             they made it on.

                       MAGGIE LEE
                 (points)
             There at the end, some passengers
             are still coming off.

                       LASZLO
             I see Zsofia.

He shouts and starts to move. We track left.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
                 (shouting)
             Zsofia!

MEDIUM ON -

TWO PASSENGERS awkwardly lift ERZSEBET's wheelchair down and
over the train steps.

                       PASSENGER
             You got her?

The PASSENGER on the left nods.

                       ERZSEBET
             Thank you, gentlemen. We'll send
             someone for the luggage. Thank you.
                       LASZLO (O.S.)
                 (shouting from some
                  distance)
             Zsofia!

CLOSE ON -

ZSOFIA, a transcendent beauty, scans the platform and begins
pushing ERZSEBET in a wheelchair along the platform.

WE TRACK RIGHT with ERZSEBET in profile who begins to cry at
the sound of LASZLO's voice. She's older than the wedding
photo seen prior. Her face is agonized and gaunt but her
expression betrays some optimism.

TRACK LEFT with LASZLO as his brow furrows with concern. THE
CAMERA CONTINUES TO SWING LEFT with LASZLO until they share
the frame. He bends to his wife.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
                 (Hungarian)
             What's happened?

ERZSEBET smiles through her tears.

                       ERZSEBET
                 (Hungarian)
             I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
                                                                70.

                           LASZLO
                     (Hungarian)
                 What happened?

                           ERZSEBET
                     (Hungarian)
                 It might not be permanent-

                           LASZLO
                     (Hungarian)
                 Someone hurt you?

     She cries, shakes her head.

                           ERZSEBET
                     (Hungarian)
                 It's osteoporosis from the famine-

     He embraces her madly, kisses her, weeps.

                           ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                     (cries)
                 I can dye my hair. I know it's
                 ugly.

                           LASZLO
                 Shh.

                           ERZSEBET
                     (Hungarian)
                 Where's Attila?

     He switches to English.

                           LASZLO
                 I didn't want him to be
                 disappointed if for any reason you
                 were delayed.

     He looks up at ZSOFIA and bounces up to embrace her.

                           LASZLO (CONT'D)
                     (Hungarian)
                 Zsofia, dear.

     He reverts again to English.

                           LASZLO (CONT'D)
                 Welcome to America.

     LASZLO,   MICHAEL and MICHELLE HOFFMAN, MAGGIE LEE, and HARRY
     LEE all   take their seats around VAN BUREN who settles at the

     appears   rightfully enchanted.

                           VAN BUREN
                 How wonderful it is to finally make
                 your acquaintance!

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
        I admit there was a period of time
        when we thought he had made you up!
        Isn't it fascinating to meet the
        significant others of great artists
        and thinkers?

                  ERZSEBET
        Thank you for taking care of my
        Laszlo.

                  VAN BUREN
        As persons of unique privilege, I
        have always thought that it is our
        duty to nurture the defining
        talents of our epoch. I possess no
        such talent whatsoever! Truth be
        told, I am terribly emulous of
        individuals like him.

                  ERZSEBET
        That mustn't be true, Mr. Van
        Buren. It seems you've done quite
        all right for yourself.

                  HARRY LEE
        Father is digging for compliments.
        Don't indulge him.

Beat.

                  ERZSEBET
        The property is beautiful.

                    MAGGIE LEE
        Isn't it?

                  VAN BUREN
        Erzsebet- pardon me, am I
        pronouncing that correctly?

                   ERZSEBET
        Oh, that's fine, just fine. Feel
        free to call me Elizabeth if you
        prefer it.
                  VAN BUREN
        Your English is impressive.

                  ERZSEBET
        Thank you. I attended University in
        England!

                    VAN BUREN
        Where?

                  ERZSEBET
        Oxford to study English. I returned
        home for Communications.

                  VAN BUREN
        Did you do anything with it?
                                                          72.

                       ERZSEBET
             Oh yes. I wrote for a popular
             national paper at home; Magyar
             Nemzet.

                       VAN BUREN
             A journalist?

                         HARRY LEE
             Cultural?

                       ERZSEBET
             Foreign affairs.

ERZSEBET turns to LASZLO.

                       ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
             Haven't you told them anything
             about me?
ERZSEBET sees that LASZLO doesn't appreciate the joke.

CLOSE ON -

She squeezes LASZLO's hand.

BACK TO -

                       VAN BUREN
             Perhaps you can help your poor
             husband to sound less like he
             shines shoes for a wage.

She smiles but doesn't like the joke.

                       VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                 (to LASZLO)
             How long have you been here now?
             Four or five years, Laszlo?! No
             more excuses.

VAN BUREN flips a small coin at LASZLO which LASZLO dodges.
VAN BUREN laughs.

                       VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
             All right, I got carried away! Pass
             that back to me, will you?

LASZLO passes it back. VAN BUREN holds it up demonstratively.

                       VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
             A penny saved...

HARRY LEE addresses ZSOFIA.

                       HARRY LEE
             Sofia, is it?

                       LASZLO
                 (corrects)
             Zsofia.
                                                                 73.

                         HARRY LEE
                   (pointedly)
               Zs-ofia... Are you planning for
               school?

     No response. A palpable awkwardness washes over the room.
     ERZSEBET finally interjects...

                         ERZSEBET
               She is, yes, but we haven't
               explored her options.

                         HARRY LEE
               Does she understand English?

                         ERZSEBET
               Oh yes. She understands very well.

     ERZSEBET chooses not to elaborate. They eat in silence.

     LASZLO pushes ERZSEBET to the front door. As they are about
     to leave, VAN BUREN halts their exit.

                         VAN BUREN
               Laszlo, may I have a word?

     ZSOFIA takes over for LASZLO and pushes ERZSEBET out the
     door. The two men meet at the room's most central point.

                           LASZLO
               Yes, sir?

                         VAN BUREN
               On Leslie's recommendation, we
               shared your plans with another
               architect. Just to get a second
               opinion - for safety reasons, as
               well.

                           LASZLO
               Who?

                         VAN BUREN
               Someone we worked with on the
               department store downtown. I forget
               his name.

     VAN BUREN passes him a file.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               Listen, they're just little
               adjustments, here and there. Places
               they thought we could save a penny.
                                                              74.

                          LASZLO
                Leslie is a bastard.

                          VAN BUREN
                He is. That's what we pay him for.

     LASZLO takes ZSOFIA down a corridor and opens the door
     revealing a rather childish arrangement he's made on the bed.

                          LASZLO
                    (Hungarian)
                I'm sorry. I remembered you as a
                little girl.

     ZSOFIA touches his face and shoulder to comfort him and steps
     inside.

     LASZLO references a small framed picture of a woman.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
                    (Hungarian)
                Look at your mother. My sister was
                beautiful, wasn't she? Even while
                she was ill, she was so beautiful.

     ZSOFIA nods.

     LASZLO rolls ERZSEBET down the hall to their room. Inside, he
     can heard struggling to lift her into bed.

                           LASZLO (O.S.)
                1, 2, 3-

     She laughs adoringly.

     ERZSEBET and LASZLO lie catatonic in bed. It's very dark.

                          ERZSEBET
                    (Hungarian)
                Are you angry?

     Silence.

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                Laszlo, are you angry with me?

     He replies in English, petulant.
                                                75.

                    LASZLO
          If you'd like to start a row with
          me, I might as well work out my
          English-

She replies in English.

                    ERZSEBET
          Stop it. Your English is perfectly
          all right. It was an unimaginative
          joke he made about you shining
          shoes.

                    LASZLO
          Tomorrow, I'll take you to see
          someone. A specialist.

                    ERZSEBET
          Don't be angry with me.

LASZLO sulks..

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          Do you not want to be with me
          anymore?

                    LASZLO
          Stop this nonsense.

                    ERZSEBET
          Do you think I look older?

                    LASZLO
          We are older.

                    ERZSEBET
          Can't you say anything kind to me?

                    LASZLO
          I love you, you cow.
ERZSEBET smiles and kisses him.
                    ERZSEBET
              (Hungarian, whispers)
          You can touch me.

                    LASZLO
          I don't want to hurt you-
          physically.

                    ERZSEBET
          You won't... I had dreams- every
          night, I dreamt I was with you.

She touches him under the sheets.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          I know what you've done, Laszlo,
          and it's all right...
                                                                76.

                         LASZLO
               What are you talking about?

                         ERZSEBET
                   (whispers)
               Laszlo, I know. I know. I know
               everything. You see, I became sick.
               Very sick. I could hardly breathe.
               I yearned to be with you and it
               made me sick. I almost died.
               Between life and death, I began
               having fantasies about you but I
               realized they were not fantasies at
               all, but visions! I was with you.
               All the time I was with you.

     She licks her palm, jerks him off, whispers in his ear.

                         ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
               Laszlo, I know what you've done.
               I'm not jealous because I was with
               you the all the time. I know
               everything that has happened to
               you, and I am here now and I will
               never leave you.

     LASZLO breaks down. His voice cracks in heaving sobs.

                         LASZLO
               Oh god! MY LOVE. MY LOVE!     I CANNOT
               BEAR IT!

                         ERZSEBET
               You can. Shh... You can. We have a
               new life. A new language. We can
               start again.

     LASZLO walks down the corridor and opens the door to discover
     ZSOFIA guiding ERZSEBET's knee to her chest who lies nude in
     the tub wearing a hair net. They both flush with
     embarrassment at the sight of LASZLO. ERZSEBET laughs as she
     tries to cover up.

                         LASZLO
               Sorry.

     He quickly steps back the way he came.

                         ERZSEBET (O.S.)

     LASZLO takes a coffee in his kitchenette reviewing VAN
     BUREN's file. He furrows his brow.

     ERZSEBET smiles at ZSOFIA, full of joy.

                         ERZSEBET
               I've missed him. Just hearing him
               mill about in the other room.
               It's...

     ERZSEBET searches for the right word.

     VAN BUREN observes the front yard from the quietude of his
     private quarters. He watches...

     LONG LENS ON -

     ZSOFIA and ERZSEBET explore the property. ZSOFIA pushes
     ERZSEBET's wheelchair through the estate's hedge maze.
     ERZSEBET says something to make ZSOFIA crack a smile.

     WE TRACK RIGHT with ZSOFIA and ERZSEBET who have put on
     something more formal for their outing into town. ZSOFIA
     pushes ERZSEBET at a steady clip.

               Perhaps we should see about some
               language classes this afternoon?
               You could take the bus in on your
               own...
     ZSOFIA hardly reacts.

                         ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
               I am positive it is the last place
               you would like to be but it's good
               for you and I can brief the
               instructor or whomever about your
               situation. Listening to me babble
               on will only get you so far.

     After some time, VAN BUREN's town car pulls up beside them.
     He rolls the window down...

                         VAN BUREN
               Where are you two headed?

                         ERZSEBET
               We're going into town.

                         VAN BUREN
               Which town is that? We've got
               several nearby, you know!

     ERZSEBET laughs pleasantly.

               city then! Us, as well.

     ERZSEBET corrects herself.

                         ERZSEBET
               Yes, the city.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (to ZSOFIA)
               Well, don't just stand there. Let
               us give you and your Auntie a lift.

     VAN BUREN opens the door to the backseat and steps out to
     help move ERZSEBET inside.


     INT. AUTOMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER

     VAN BUREN sits in the passenger side front seat. The two
     ladies sit in the back.

                         VAN BUREN
               I have a friend in New York, a
               newspaper man. He's always on the
               lookout for new talent. Shall I
               mention you to him?
                                                       79.

                    ERZSEBET
          Well, yes, of course. That is very
          kind of you, Mr. Van Buren.

ERZSEBET thinks, hesitates, then...

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          Would that mean I would have to
          work out of New York?

                    VAN BUREN
          In the beginning, perhaps... But
          you haven't got the job yet so
          let's not get ahead of ourselves.

                    ERZSEBET
          No, no, of course not. I did not
          mean it to be presumptuous!

The road is rough and the engine, loud.

                    VAN BUREN
          What's that?

                    ERZSEBET
              (shouts to be heard)
          I did not mean it to be
          presumptuous!

VAN BUREN accepts her acknowledgement and moves on.

                    VAN BUREN
          In any event, you could commute
          there with me at the start. I'm
          there Monday to Friday.

                    ERZSEBET
          Well, sure, that could be fine. I'd
          have to speak with Laszlo though.

                    VAN BUREN
          When we break ground, he will have
          his hands full, I can assure you!
VAN BUREN's intent is enigmatic.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I enjoy showing friends around
          Manhattan. You mustn't have seen
          much on your way in.

                    ERZSEBET
          The Penn Station Terminal was very
          nice.

                    VAN BUREN
          -a pity that it's become so full of
          tramps hassling women and children
          with their arms outstretched. They
          line up and extend from the walls
          as if integral to its very
          foundation like-
                                                         80.

He searches for the apt metaphor.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
           -like a haunted wall mural!

                    ERZSEBET
          Ah, perhaps that is why I felt so
          at home. I'm a former bag lady
          myself who does also enjoy the work
          of the Dutch masters.

                    VAN BUREN
          `Earthly Delights!' You pictured it
          just as I meant it. Clever, clever.

ERZSEBET looks at her niece with some trepidation about the
conversation then digs deeper.

                    ERZSEBET
          "Integral to its foundation." You
          sound like my husband. Although a
          mural's decorative; nothing to do
          with the foundation.

The jab doesn't seem to land. No response from VAN BUREN.
They ride in silence for a moment. It's unclear whether or
not he's taken offense.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          Where did you get your passion for
          architecture?

                    VAN BUREN
          Oh, we've done buildings before but
          I'd hardly call them artistic. I
          suppose it was because the cellar
          was full.

                    ERZSEBET
          Pardon?

                    VAN BUREN
          I collect books, butterflies, and
          such. Above all though, Portuguese
          Madeira. I take it every night
          after supper.

He turns to her.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          I did the maths and if I were to
          uncork a bottle seven days a week
          for the next thirty years - the
          maximum of my life expectancy - I
          shouldn't need more than ten
          thousand altogether. So once the
          cellar was full, it was time I set
          about in a new direction. Out of
          the cellar and into the sky.

                    ERZSEBET
          If you drink a bottle of Madeira
          every day, I shouldn't think you'd
          last thirty years.
                                                                 81.

                         VAN BUREN
               I always keep good company.

     ERZSEBET senses VAN BUREN asserting himself, flirting with
     her.

     LASZLO enters the trailer where LESLIE WOODROW is on a
     telephone call. LASZLO throws the file at LESLIE's head...

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               I'm going to have to call you back.

     LESLIE hangs up the phone.

                         LASZLO
               How dare you.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               How dare I what?

     LASZLO's accent is embellished when he is angry.

                         LASZLO
               You go behind the back- and have
               them meet with another goddamned
               designer! Who in the hell is James
               T. Simpson? You're trying to get me
               sacked!

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               I didn't tell him to meet with
               anyone. Of course, I didn't. You
               think I feel like working with you
               hating my guts for the next two
               godforsaken years?

     LASZLO blinks.

                         LESLIE WOODROW (CONT'D)
               Jim Simpson is a smart guy. He
               doesn't want to interfere at all.

     LASZLO taps the document with his index finger.

                         LASZLO
               I'm not making these changes.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               I'm afraid it's not up to you. The
               casts are already finished. We put
               in that order over a month ago.
               This is the first time you're
               hearing about it?
                                                              82.

                         LASZLO
               No one told me a damned thing.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               Harrison said he would talk it over
               with you. I'm sorry you found out
               this way. I really am.

     LASZLO sits down and starts re-drawing the plans in a fever.

     He makes new connections, new corridors, new ideas, with a
     few strokes of a pen then slams it down in front of LESLIE.

                         LASZLO
               There. It's mine again. He cuts
               three meters from the top, I add it
               to the bottom!

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               We can't afford all this! I'm
               already over-budget this quarter!

                         LASZLO
               Use what you need to of my fee.

     LESLIE tries to reason with him.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               What's the difference between forty
               and fifty feet, anyway?! The
               ceilings are still plenty high!

                         LASZLO
               Get it approved, Leslie.

                         LESLIE WOODROW
               We have a walk-thru next week and
               Jim is supposed to be there. Just
               hear him out. You can state your
               case to Harrison and Harry Lee. I
               won't open my mouth, I swear it.

     It's raining cats and dogs. Thunder, lightning, wind.

     ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE TRACKING SHOT -

     SEVEN MEN; LASZLO, VAN BUREN, HARRY LEE, LESLIE WOODROW,
     MAYOR KINNEY, MICHAEL HOFFMAN, and JIM SIMPSON stand in the
     newly dug out foundation; a corridor of dirt reminiscent of
     the First War trenches.

     They all hold out large canvas umbrellas to shield themselves
     from the torrential downpour.

                         LASZLO
               For the cantilevered floors- we
               plan to use upside-down T-shaped
               beams integrated into concrete
               slabs down here.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          This will form both the ceiling of
          the space below and provide
          resistance against compression...

MAYOR KINNEY tries to make sense of the blueprints.

                    MAYOR KINNEY
          Which corridor are we in now?

LESLIE nervously tries to explain...

                     LESLIE WOODROW
          We're below ground here. It's a
          sort of- passageway between the
          main unit and the three mid-sized
          modular units to the south and
          southeast.

JIM SIMPSON reviews LASZLO's new plans...

                    JIM SIMPSON
          I don't see how any of this
          acknowledges my proposed cuts. We
          are just spinning our wheels out
          here. I took ten feet off the
          height of these damned things and
          now we are 30 feet underground?! I
          mean, what is- what are all these
          new connections between facilities?

                    LASZLO
          A better idea.

                    JIM SIMPSON
          What are they for? You put all
          these together and you've added on
          a quarter mile or so of tunnel to
          carve out on top of everything
          else!

LASZLO keeps his cool. He speaks to be heard but never shouts
explaining himself to the group.

                    LASZLO
          We excavate the entire diameter of
          the tunnel system using a- full-
          face method.

                    JIM SIMPSON
          For what?! Why can't people just
          walk themselves directly across the
          courtyard?!

                    LASZLO
          Something inside for the people to
          discover.

LASZLO is starting to get as worked up as we have ever seen
him.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          And so it is one building and not
          four! For its harmony. You said it
          before, Mr. Van Buren!

                                                         84.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
          You expected it to be one building,
          and now it is!

VAN BUREN nods, uncomfortable. JIM SIMPSON scoffs.

                    JIM SIMPSON
          I'll tell you- we are not going
          back inside until you look us in
          the eye and you tell us where you
          are willing to compromise?!

LASZLO seethes but remains calm.

                    LASZLO
          Jim, tell us again what you've
          built?

                    JIM SIMPSON
          I'll tell you about what I've
          built, whatever-the-hell-your-name-
          is! A shopping center in New Hope,
          a hotel in Stamford Connecticut-

LESLIE INTERJECTS...

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          Now Jim, let me remind everyone
          that Laszlo has offered to
          personally off-set these costs-

                    JIM SIMPSON
          You brought me in here to tell you
          what it is that you do not need!
          You don't need this guy!

JIM SIMPSON points at LASZLO, accusingly.

                    JIM SIMPSON (CONT'D)
          This whole thing is just- bizarre,
          Leslie!

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          I really think you two might see
          eye-to-eye if you just spent a
          little more time getting to know
          each other. Honestly.

JIM throws his papers up in the air.

                    LASZLO
          Jim. Listen to me.

                    JIM SIMPSON
          I'm listening.

                    LASZLO
          Everything we see that is ugly-
          stupid, cruel, and ugly. Everything
          is your fault.

Taking a moment to fully digest the severity of LASZLO's
sentiment, JIM SIMPSON replies with a violent push causing
LASZLO to slip and fall in the mud.
                                                              85.

                         VAN BUREN
               Jim, you stop that right now!

     JIM SIMPSON appears embarrassed.

                            JIM SIMPSON
               I'm sorry-

                         VAN BUREN
               Think it's time for you to head
               home, Jim. Thanks for your insight.

     JIM SIMPSON walks away. VAN BUREN extends a hand to LASZLO.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               I trust you. I trust you, all
               right?

     MAYOR KINNEY walks ahead of the group with VAN BUREN.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               Are you sure about this guy? I know
               Jim lost his temper but he had a
               few points back there, didn't he?
               My office is fielding complaints
               about the plans for this place on a
               daily basis, more or less! Jim's a
               Protestant! Gives folks peace of
               mind. People are worried it's going
               to ruin the hillside, Harrison.

                         VAN BUREN
               We'll do something. A little event
               for the community. Get them on-
               side.

     VAN BUREN's expression doesn't betray his intent.

                         VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
               And Jim will stay on.

     MAYOR KINNEY furrows his brow.

                         MAYOR KINNEY
               Does Jim know that? I think he
               thinks he's fired.

                         VAN BUREN
               I'll have Leslie telephone him
               tomorrow, and Jim can advise from

     VAN BUREN gestures to LASZLO behind them.

               It's better for morale this way,

     The sun is shining. A small crowd has gathered for a ribbon
     cutting ceremony. VAN BUREN, HARRY LEE, and LASZLO pose for a
     photograph with MAYOR KINNEY. Following a round of pictures,
     VAN BUREN calls out...

                         VAN BUREN
               Girls! Girls! Come in for a
               picture!

     ERZSEBET, ZSOFIA, MAGGIE LEE enter from the side and gather
     around the core group. ERZSEBET tugs at LASZLO's blazer and
     he obliges by kneeling down to her chair. She whispers in his
     ear...

                         ERZSEBET
                   (Hungarian, whispers)
               I'm proud of you. Make love to me
               tonight.

     VAN BUREN holds up a shovel demonstratively.

                         VAN BUREN
               All right everyone! On three...

                         EVERYONE
               O-ne! T-wo!

     Everyone but ZSOFIA smiles.

                           VAN BUREN
               And...

     He pulls the shovel back.

                           EVERYONE
               Three!

     The shovel breaks the earth.

     CLOSE HANDHELD ON -

     The sun is setting. Several party guests are swimming. It's
     exactly like a Renoir. Sun-drenched ZSOFIA bathes sensually
     in the pond, her skin tightens with goosebumps. HARRY LEE
     swims up to greet her.

                         HARRY LEE
                   (cheerful)
               Rub-a-dub, three maids in a tub.
               And who do you think were there?
               The butcher, the baker, the
               candlestick-maker-

     He takes some water in his mouth and spits it out.

                         HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
               Invigorating, isn't it?
                                                            87.

NEW ANGLE ON -

By the shore, ERZSEBET lies on a towel near LASZLO, VAN
BUREN, and MAGGIE LEE. All of them laugh madly; a joyous
scene.

                    ERZSEBET
              (hysterical)
          Did you ever manage to find the
          place?

                    MAGGIE LEE
          After driving around for hours in
          the dark looking for this damned
          camouflaged mailbox-

MAGGIE LEE laughs in anticipation of the punchline as she
recounts the story.



          MAGGIE LEE (CONT'D)              VAN BUREN
-we walked in the door, and        (interjects)
the table had just been         It was well after ten o'clock-
cleared for dessert!
                    ERZSEBET
          -and then what?!

                    MAGGIE LEE
          I noticed something a little funny
          about the other dinner guests.

                     ERZSEBET
          How so?!

                    MAGGIE LEE
          They just all looked a bit pale in
          the face, I reckon...

Even LASZLO can't help but grin now.

                     ERZSEBET
          OH NO!

                    VAN BUREN
          Maggie, you're exaggerating.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          I AM NOT, I swear it! They looked
          exactly like that popular painting,
          you know the one-?

MAGGIE LEE imitates Edvard Munch's `The Scream' causing
another fit of laughter.

                    ERZSEBET
          Stop it! I can't breathe.
                                                         88.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          Daddy kept apologizing to our
          hostess-

                    VAN BUREN
          For context, her husband is among
          Van Buren Steel's most important
          private clients.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          Daddy tried to explain everything
          that had made us late as she
          prepared for us what appeared to be
          a delightful looking little trifle!

                    ERZSEBET
          Was it awful?

                    MAGGIE LEE
          I kid you not; cow tallow and fruit
          pie!

                      ERZSEBET
                (laughs)
          NO!

                    MAGGIE LEE
          -and poor daddy has such a sweet
          tooth! I didn't know how to warn
          him in front of everyone before he
          took a bite this big!

MAGGIE demonstrates the enormous slice with her index
fingers.

                      ERZSEBET
                (to VAN BUREN)
          NO!

                      VAN BUREN
          Indeed.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          He began gagging like a house cat!

She imitates a house cat gagging on a fur ball.

                    MAGGIE LEE (CONT'D)
          And all he could say to explain
          was...

MAGGIE LEE holds herself together for the finale.

                    MAGGIE LEE (CONT'D)
          `Dear... I am allergic.' to which
          our concerned hostess replied, `
          allergic to what?!', and he says...

VAN BUREN buries his face in hands.

                    MAGGIE LEE (CONT'D)
          `TO THAT. I am very allergic to
          whatever THAT is.'
                                                              89.

     Everyone howls.

     LONG LENS ON -

     ZSOFIA and HARRY LEE come up from the water and stand beside
     VAN BUREN, MAGGIE LEE, and ERZSEBET who is now situated back
     in her wheelchair.

     NEW ANGLE ON -

     LASZLO regards them but stands talking with GORDON and
     GORDON's son, WILLIAM (significantly older than when we last
     saw him). The three of them observe a small construction crew
     that carry futons above their heads which implies they'll be
     sleeping on-site.
     WILLIAM points.

                         WILLIAM
               Is that your crew?

                         GORDON
               They'll sleep here.

                         WILLIAM
               It's a lot of them. (Beat) What's
               that thing over there?

                         GORDON
               On the left?

     WILLIAM nods.

                         GORDON (CONT'D)
               That's a motor grader. We used to
               do it with horses. Makes a flat
               surface to pour on.

                         LASZLO
               We can take you down there in the
               morning if you are curious.

     GORDON squeezes his son.

                         GORDON
               What do you say we get you in one
               of them machines?

                         HARRY LEE (O.S.)
               Big day, Mr. Toth!

     HARRY LEE approaches the scene.

                          LASZLO
               Yes.
                                                         90.

HARRY LEE, drunk but not sloppy, puts an arm around LASZLO
and WE TRACK with them as they walk off.

                    HARRY LEE
          Leslie mentioned during our meeting
          last week with Jim that you're
          putting your fee back into the
          project. That seems a bit
          irresponsible given your situation,
          doesn't it? Will it even last you
          to the end of your commitment?

LASZLO is silent, then...

                    LASZLO
          I will figure something out.

                    HARRY LEE
          Have you discussed it with your
          wife?

                    LASZLO
          She will be supportive.

                    HARRY LEE
          Suit yourself but I wouldn't do it,
          and I know Leslie certainly
          wouldn't do it, so I didn't want
          you to think you'd be setting any
          sort of precedent.

                    LASZLO
          I expect nothing from either of
          you.

BEAT.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          How does that work exactly? The
          company paying themselves to
          finance?

                    HARRY LEE
          Do you not think I deserve to be
          paid for the time and energy I
          devote to this project?

The question hangs in the air as they come to a stop.

                    HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
          Might I make a suggestion?

                     LASZLO
          You may.

                    HARRY LEE
          Your niece has made several of our
          guests very uncomfortable. Perhaps
          you should have a talk with her.

                    LASZLO
          About what?
                                                                 91.

                         HARRY LEE
               Don't get me wrong. She's very
               lovely to look at and as much as we
               all dream of having a bird that
               keeps her trap shut, it comes off
               like a rude affectation. I've tried
               to connect, make conversation. It
               goes nowhere.

     LASZLO doesn't respond.

                         HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
               Oh, I see. It must run in the
               family.

     No response.

                         HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
               I would like us to be friends...

                         LASZLO
               This is not- friendly, Harry.

     HARRY LEE lets go, exasperated.

                         HARRY LEE
               I didn't say I'd like to slip my
               prick into her. Forget it! I've had
               too much to drink. I need a nap.

     HARRY LEE begins to walk off and turns around to share a
     final sentiment.

                         HARRY LEE (CONT'D)
                   (venomous)
               We tolerate you.


     EXT. VISTA - MOMENTS LATER
99                                                                99
     LASZLO approaches ERZSEBET, ZSOFIA, and VAN BUREN.

                         LASZLO
               It's time for us to go.

                         VAN BUREN
               You don't want to join us for
               dinner at the house?

                          LASZLO
               We start early tomorrow. Thanks for
               the event.

                         VAN BUREN
                   (to ERZSEBET)
               Does he ever take a rest?

                         ERZSEBET
               Never. Good night, Mr. Van Buren.

     LASZLO turns ERZSEBET in her chair and WE TRACK with them
     back towards the main property. ZSOFIA follows...
                                                                 92.

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                What's the rush?

                          LASZLO
                We can talk at the house.

                          ERZSEBET
                Can you slow down?

                          LASZLO
                    (matter-of-fact)
                I am forfeiting the remainder of my
                fee due to some expenses
                unforeseen.

                          ERZSEBET
                So, that's what the son kept
                alluding to.

                          LASZLO
                Yes. He's a snake.

      LASZLO regards ZSOFIA just next to him.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
                    (Hungarian)
                Don't go near him Zsofia.

      ZSOFIA nods, appreciative of her uncle's sentiment.

                          ERZSEBET
                All right, so what will that mean
                for us?

                          LASZLO
                I will figure something out.

                          ERZSEBET
                We will figure something out. I
                suppose we can make due on my
                salary.

                          LASZLO
                -your salary?

      ERZSEBET's tone is playful though her voice does quiver with
      some concern.

                          ERZSEBET
                Mr. Van Buren's helped me with a
                job interview in New York City. I'm
                sure once they meet me, they won't
                be able to resist me.


      INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
100                                                              100
      LASZLO, ERZSEBET, ZSOFIA, GORDON, and WILLIAM sit for a
      peasant's supper that ERZSEBET's prepared for them.
                                                           93.

                    GORDON
          Thank you for the supper, Mrs.
          Toth.

                    ERZSEBET
          I thought we might have our own
          little party to celebrate all of
          your hard work. You've come so far,
          the both of you.

                    GORDON
          Oh, it's not mine really.

                    ERZSEBET
              (pointedly)
          That's not what Laszlo tells me. He
          says he couldn't have done it
          without you.

LASZLO looks a little embarrassed at the affection he's
expressed in private for his colleague and friend.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          Do you have a misses at home,
          Gordon?

                    GORDON
              (mournful)
          William's mother, Augusta, passed
          away in `43- she got sick and died
          of a damned tooth infection of all
          things.

ERZSEBET directs her attention to WILLIAM.

                    ERZSEBET
          I am very sorry to hear that, and I
          am terribly sorry for your loss.

                    GORDON
          He's all right. He was too young
          then to remember much, and I was
          gone training two years in Arizona
          before they shipped us all off to
          Naples, Italy; 92nd Infantry
          Division. They wouldn't let me back
          home all that time, not once.
          Augusta's sister looked after him
          until I got back. Kept me alive
          though, knowing he was waiting for
          me.

GORDON puts a hand on his teenage son's back.

                    GORDON (CONT'D)
          Kept me good and alive, thank
          goodness.

ERZSEBET blurts out.

                    ERZSEBET
          Zsofia's mother passed.

ZSOFIA, previously emotive, turns to stone.
                                                               94.

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                Losing a mother- it's an
                unfathomable loss, you see. To lose
                one's birth mother is to lose the
                very foundation on which we stand.

      ERZSEBET turns to WILLIAM...

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                The mind may not know its loss but
                the heart does.

      WILLIAM finally speaks for himself.

                          WILLIAM
                I remember her.

                          GORDON
                That's because I've told you so
                much about her. You were too small.
      WILLIAM is defiant.

                          WILLIAM
                No, I remember Augusta. I just
                wanted to make it easier on you.

      ERZSEBET smokes leafing through her husband's drawings. After
      some time, LASZLO enters from behind her...

                          LASZLO
                What are you doing?

      She doesn't turn around to regard him. She keeps observing
      what's in front of her.

                          ERZSEBET
                Oh, I'm just looking at you.

      LASZLO smiles, kisses the back of her neck.

                          LASZLO
                What do you think?
                          ERZSEBET
                It's unusual. Even for you.

                          LASZLO
                You think so?

                          ERZSEBET
                Many rooms are quite small. The
                ceilings are high...

                          LASZLO
                Yes. Inside, you must look upwards.
                                                               95.

                          ERZSEBET
                So, which part of it are we paying
                for?

                          LASZLO
                The height of the ceilings. The
                glass above.

      VARIOUS ANGLES OF MEN AT WORK. The vista has transformed into
      an active construction site on a grand scale. LASZLO and
      GORDON supervise as their crew lays the rest of the concrete
      foundation.


      INT. THE CONGREGATION MIKVEH ISRAEL - MIKVEH

      LASZLO, ERZSEBET, ZSOFIA, and MICHAEL & MICHELLE HOFFMAN file
      into a corridor towards the basement that's been set up for a
      makeshift service at Yom Kippur. ERZSEBET laughs a bit at the
      banal functionality of their surroundings.

                          ERZSEBET
                The service is in here?

      MICHELLE HOFFMAN nods.

                          MICHELLE HOFFMAN
                    (clarifies)
                For the overflow.

                          ERZSEBET
                Because of the holiday?

                          MICHELLE HOFFMAN
                The community is growing.


      INT. THE CONGREGATION MIKVEH ISRAEL - LATER

      LASZLO and MICHAEL HOFFMAN wear Talith reciting the Viddui,
      rhythmically pounding their chests in accordance with the
      prayer.

                          LASZLO AND MICHAEL
                    (chanting in Hebrew)
                We have stolen, slandered, sinned...
                We were wicked, malicious, have
                taken, and lied
                We've been evil and given harmful
                advice...

      LASZLO hits his chest with considerable force.

                       (chanting in Hebrew)
                   We have deceived, mocked-

      ULTRA-WIDE ON -

      In the distance, a long train, made small by the landscape.
      Peace and beauty.

                             LASZLO (CONT'D)
                   Rebelled, against god, against
                   others,
                   We are spiteful.

      ANGLE ON -

      The tracks rush at us on a wide-angle lens.

                             LASZLO (CONT'D)
                   We have turned away,
                   Deliberately.

      BACK TO ULTRA-WIDE -

      The train derails and explosions appear in the smoke from the
      steam engine... The event is catastrophic but we are so far
      away that it hardly makes a sound.

      ERZSEBET wakes up in bed wailing. LASZLO is alert, terrified.

                             LASZLO
                   What's happening?!

                             ERZSEBET
                   It's too much!

                             LASZLO
                   What's too much?!

      She lets out another primal scream.

                             ERZSEBET
                   The pain is too much. I need
                   Zsofia! She has my medication.

      LASZLO stumbles out of bed and exits. ERZSEBET writhes in the
      sheets.
                                                                  97.

      LASZLO, HARRY LEE, VAN BUREN, and two ENGINEERS are huddled
      into the back of a makeshift office space on the lot. LESLIE
      WOODROW holds a telephone to his ear...

                  I have everyone here with me now,
                  yes.

      Beat.

                            LESLIE WOODROW (CONT'D)
                  I see. Well, please let us know if
                  there is anything at all we can do.
                  We are terribly sorry for the news.

      Beat.

                             LESLIE WOODROW (CONT'D)
                  On tenterhooks at this end so give
                  me a ring here when you have
                  something.

      LESLIE hangs up the phone.

                            LESLIE WOODROW (CONT'D)
                  A big section came undone, he
                  couldn't tell me which one for
                  certain, and it took seven freight
                  cars along with it.

      VAN BUREN slams his hands on the desk.

                            VAN BUREN
                      (shouts)
                  How the hell did you find these
                  people, Leslie?!

                            HARRY LEE
                  Transpo company is our own, Dad-

                            VAN BUREN
                  WHAT?!

                            HARRY LEE
                  We sent our own guys to Charleston.

                            LESLIE WOODROW
                  The rail cars were ours too... It
                  was cheaper given all the back and
                  forth. It's well over a hundred
                  shipments, Harrison.

                            VAN BUREN
                  You don't utter another goddamned
                  word to the rail company until
                  Michael can advise.

                            LESLIE WOODROW
                  I'm hoping to have more answers for
                  you soon, sir.
                                                 98.

                    LASZLO
          How far is it? Can we see what can
          be salvaged?

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          The accident put two brakemen in
          the hospital. It's a real mess out
          there.

                    VAN BUREN
          Send their families flowers for
          Christ's sake-

Beat.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          Wait. Don't. Looks guilty.

                    HARRY LEE
          I'll call Michael.

HARRY LEE exits.

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          What would you like me to do in the
          meantime?

                       VAN BUREN
          With what?

                       LESLIE WOODROW
          Our crew.

                    VAN BUREN
          Let them go.

LASZLO looks sick.

                    LASZLO
          Sir, you can't-

                    VAN BUREN
          I CAN! YES! YES, I CAN!

VAN BUREN paces furiously.

                    VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
          People are going to write about
          this! I'm staring down the barrel
          of the next two years of my
          goddamned life, Mr. Toth! What if
          one of them dies? What if both of
          them die? Who's going to pay for
          it? Are you going to pay for it?!

                    LESLIE WOODROW
          Laszlo, in the interest of
          transparency, before I came to
          retrieve you, I had already advised
          Mr. Van Buren to cut his losses-
                                                               99.

                          VAN BUREN
                Shut up, Leslie.

      LESLIE swallows, humiliated. VAN BUREN exhales.

                          LASZLO
                Sir, please.

                          VAN BUREN
                Don't beg. It's unbecoming. You're
                welcome to stay here until you've
                found your footing elsewhere. I
                have a mess to clean up.

                          LASZLO
                I'm sorry, Gordon.

                          GORDON
                Don't apologize to me.

                          LASZLO
                I can give you some money while you
                look for something.

                          GORDON
                I'll be fine.

                          LASZLO
                    (affirmative)
                You have a kid. I'll give you
                something and you'll take it.

      LASZLO stops in his tracks and looks at GORDON.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
                You got any hop on you?

      GORDON looks grave.

                          GORDON
                None at all. I'm off it.

                          LASZLO

      LASZLO smashes the model in a terrible fury. ERZSEBET
      observes her husband's tantrum, unmoved.

                          ERZSEBET
                You're making me a mess to clean
                up.

                 It's over.

                 You have to march over there right
                 now and get him excited again. Keep
                 him engaged. You know how these
                 rich fellows are. For him, it's
                 like refurbishing a kitchen.

      He smokes a pipe at a drawing board. A green desk lamp
      highlights an inscrutable expression.

      There's visible bruising, track marks, where his sleeves are
      rolled up.


      INT. LASZLO AND ERZSEBET'S TENEMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
115                                                             115
      ERZSEBET and LASZLO sit across from ZSOFIA and her husband,
      BINYAMIN, an orthodox Jewish man. ZSOFIA is five months
      pregnant and speaking again.

                          ZSOFIA
                    (soft-spoken)
                We have some news.

                           LASZLO
                As do I.

                          ERZSEBET
                Oh, how exciting. What is it
                Laszlo?

                          LASZLO
                Please. Zsofia, go ahead.

                          ZSOFIA
                We are making Aliyah.

      ERZSEBET looks a little heartbroken.

                           ERZSEBET
                What?

                          ZSOFIA
                We are going to Jerusalem.

                          ERZSEBET
                Yes, I heard you.

                          ZSOFIA
                Binyamin has family there.
                                                        102.

                     BINYAMIN
           My older brothers relocated with
           their families in 1950. They became
           citizens.

ERZSEBET nods, considers this.

                     ERZSEBET
           Life is difficult there. Have you
           thought this through?

                     ZSOFIA
           It is our obligation.

                      LASZLO
           To whom?

                     ZSOFIA
           Our repatriation is our liberation.

LASZLO swats at the air, starting to get worked up.

                     LASZLO
           Where will you live? Where will you
           work?

                     BINYAMIN
           We can stay with my brother's
           family when we first arrive.

ERZSEBET silences LASZLO by resting her hand on his.

                     ERZSEBET
           I was planning to help with the
           baby.

                     BINYAMIN
           My brother's wife can help, also.

                     ZSOFIA
           I am Jewish. My child is Jewish.
           It's time for us to go home.
ERZSEBET snaps.

                     ERZSEBET
           Does it somehow make us less Jewish
           that we are here?

Silence.

                     ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
           Oh, I see, perhaps Binyamin did not
           recognize me to begin with-

                      ZSOFIA
           He does.

Beat.
                                                        103.

                       ERZSEBET
          I'm sorry.

                    ZSOFIA
          No, I am sorry.

                    ERZSEBET
          No, it's wonderful news and we
          reacted badly out of self-interest.
          We are simply...

ERZSEBET's voice cracks and she begins to cry.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          -going to miss you.

                    ZSOFIA
          Well, we would like you to come.

ERZSEBET wipes her tears away trying to pull herself
together.

                    ERZSEBET
          Dear, we have jobs here.

                    ZSOFIA
          You can have a better job in
          Israel.

                    ERZSEBET
          I like my job!

                    ZSOFIA
          A woman's column. It's beneath you.

                    ERZSEBET
          I write for a paper and I'm paid
          for it! How many women my age could
          make the same claim?

There's a heavy silence.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
              (deadpan)
          What's your news, Laszlo?

                    LASZLO
          Harrison's asked me back.

ERZSEBET looks up at him.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          Michael came by the office today.
          Insurance monies came through. They
          plan to forego the library to
          compensate for legal expenses but
          they want to complete the project.

                    ERZSEBET
          What about your job here at
          Heywood?
                                                    104.

Silence.

                     ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
           You throw everything up in the air,
           just like that?

ERZSEBET sulks.

                     ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
           I don't like that man.

                     LASZLO
           You scarcely knew him.

                     ERZSEBET
           He dropped you as quickly as he
           took you on.

Beat.

                     ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
           You've already said yes, I take it?

No response.

                     LASZLO
           He's in Roma on business and would
           like me to join him to review
           marbles for the altarpiece in
           Carrara.

                     ERZSEBET
           See! I told you that for him it's
           like doing a kitchen!

ERZSEBET is embarrassed by their public dispute.

                     ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
           Everyone is leaving me.

                     ZSOFIA
           No, it isn't true.

                        ERZSEBET
           Isn't it?

                     ZSOFIA
           No. Uncle Laszlo is leaving you
           only a short time.

                        LASZLO
           Some days.

                     ZSOFIA
           And I will visit and so will you.
           We will find a way.

                     LASZLO
           I can arrange to have you dropped
           and picked up at the newspaper
           while I'm gone.
                                                                   105.

                             ERZSEBET
                   It's not just this trip. You'll be
                   at Doylestown again now... I'll be
                   fine on my own.

                             LASZLO
                   I will make arrangements.

      ERZSEBET holds on to LASZLO for dear life.

                             ERZSEBET
                   Promise you won't let it drive you
                   mad.

                                LASZLO
                   I promise.

      In a small toiletry pouch with his shaving kit, LASZLO pulls
      out a small syringe and spoon. He makes an internal decision
      and dismantles the syringe, making it less recognizable at a
      glance. He tucks it back in the pouch for safe-keeping and
      places it in his luggage.

                             ERZSEBET (O.S.)
                   It's time to go! You'll be late!

      A perfect portrait of VAN BUREN in a white suit.

      ANGLE ON -

      LASZLO and VAN BUREN sip coffees and smoke at an outdoor
      table, the sunlight is brilliant and white hot.

                             VAN BUREN
                   I must say, Mr. Toth, you look a
                   mess. I'd expect your Elizabeth to
                   be taking better care of you.

                             LASZLO
                   The years have been difficult.

                             VAN BUREN
                   For us all! For us all!

      VAN BUREN regards his watch.

                             VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                   Where in the hell is he?
                                                              106.

                             LASZLO
                   I am sure he will be along any
                   minute.

      Beat.

                              VAN BUREN
                   This is why I never do business
                   with Italians. They are the spics
                   of Europe.

      LASZLO points.

                             LASZLO
                   That's him.

      ANGLE ON -

      A middle-aged man, ORAZIO, on approach. He waves
      enthusiastically at LASZLO.

                             ORAZIO
                       (calls out)
                   Ciao amico Laz-o!

      ORAZIO reaches him and embraces him.

                             LASZLO
                   Nice to see you.

      He kisses LASZLO and extends his hand to VAN BUREN. ORAZIO is
      missing two fingers on his right hand so he offers him his
      left.

                             ORAZIO
                   Orazio, a pleasure to meet you. I
                   will take a quick coffee and we
                   will go.

      VAN BUREN nods. ORAZIO heads inside the cafe.

                             VAN BUREN
                   What happened to his hand?

                             LASZLO
                   Dangerous work-


      EXT. CARRARA MARBLE QUARRY - LATER
119                                                              119
      Dramatic skies frame a sea of white marble. Shapes that
      resemble small pueblos without entrances emerge from the
      rock. Channeling machines pillage the earth, excavating
      marble, Venato, Arabescato, and Cardoso stone. The air
      whistles. The sun bears down.

      HANDHELD ON -

      VAN BUREN, ORAZIO and LASZLO walk across the massive lower
      flatbed of the quarry. Colossal blocks of stone encircle
      them.
                                                              107.

                          ORAZIO
                You are tough, Mr. Laz-o, you know?
                Not so many people I see anymore
                from before the war.

                          VAN BUREN
                I've worn the wrong shoes for this
                trek. May, I take your arm Laszlo?

      LASZLO takes VAN BUREN by the arm, steadying him.

                          ORAZIO
                Step where I step and you'll be all
                right.

      ORAZIO leads them further and further.

                          ORAZIO (CONT'D)
                I'm not surprised to see you
                though! Some people; you just knew
                somehow they would be all right.
                You are stubborn! I am stubborn
                too. I am so stubborn, I never
                leave it here! I traveled only once
                in twenty years to Giulino, Azzano
                to beat the corpse of Mussolini
                with my own hands. Those of us
                here, my colleagues, we are
                anarchisti, the resistance. No one
                knows the quarries like us. We led
                members of the Esercito Nazionale
                Repubblicano into the caves here,
                captured them, dropped stones on
                them.

      They come upon a beautiful alcove of dark stone.

                          ORAZIO (CONT'D)
                Here we are... It's beautiful, no?
                The channeling will be done here in
                one month. If you like it, we can
                have it fixed and ready for you in
                April.

      VAN BUREN is once again enchanted. He walks all around it,
      presses his cheek to it. It's sensual, fetishistic.

                          VAN BUREN
                It's beautiful. Exactly as you
                described, Laszlo.

                          ORAZIO
                If you like, I tell the boys and we
                bring it to my atelier when the
                stone is cut.

                          LASZLO
                We like it.

      CUE: Mina's "You are my destiny.' The lively music blasts
      through the space, an echo chamber.
                                                                108.

      Surrounded by magnificent classical and modernistic
      sculptures in various stages of completion, a group of local
      artisans and masons drink copious amounts of digestivo at the
      back of the atelier and dance together. Everyone sings along
      in improper English.

                             EVERYONE
                       (sings)
                   You are my destiny
                   you are that's what to me
                   You are my happiness
                   That's what you are
                   You have my sweet caress
                   You share my loneliness
                   You're more than life to me
                   That's what you are
                   Heaven and heaven alone
                   Can take your love from me....

      ANGLE ON -

      An entranced VAN BUREN observes LASZLO from the shadows.

      LONG LENS ON -

      LASZLO dances with girls and boys, exhilarated. He sings!

                             LASZLO
                       (sings)
                   'Cause I'd be a fool
                   To ever leave you dear
                   And a fool I'd never be
                   You are my destiny
                   You share my reverie
                   You're more than life to me
                   That's what you are.

      LASZLO abruptly excuses himself from his dance partner and
      walks away from the group.

      ANGLE ON -

      VAN BUREN follows LASZLO with his eyes.

      VAN BUREN walks past a row of statues, looking for the
      toilet. He hears LASZLO breathing heavy and moves to
      investigate.

                             VAN BUREN
                       (calls out)
                   Mr. T-oth, it's time we return to
                   our quarters. Orazio has kindly
                   offered us a place to sleep for the
                   night.

      VAN BUREN turns to discover LASZLO slouched against a wide
      marble column in a terrible state, an unspooled pouch of hop
      gear in his lap... His eyes have rolled back in his head.
      He's barely responsive.
                                                              109.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                What have you done to yourself?

      VAN BUREN slides his back down the column and sits next to
      him displaying a casual air.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                It's a shame seeing how your people
                treat themselves. If you resent
                your persecution, why then do you
                make of yourself such an easy
                target?

      LASZLO cannot respond.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                If you act as a loafer living off
                handouts, a societal leech, how can
                you rightfully expect a different
                result? You have so much potential
                and yet you squander it.

      LASZLO starts to vomit and VAN BUREN moves in behind him,
      pats him on the back.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                Get it out. Get it out, my friend.

      Below frame, VAN BUREN fusses with his belt. LASZLO gags and
      coughs.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                It's all right, my boy. Get it out.

      VAN BUREN systematically pulls down LASZLO's pants below
      frame. He spits, and thrusts.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                    (whispers, slurs)
                Who do you think you are? You think
                you're special? You think you float
                directly above everyone you
                encounter because you are
                beautiful? Because you are
                educated?

      LONG LENS ON -

      LASZLO's face is pressed against the ground. He's too strung
      out to defend himself. His eyes widen in terror.

                          VAN BUREN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                You're a tramp. Shh. You're a lady
                of the night.

      The assault is brief but clear.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      HANDHELD ON -

      LASZLO walks and stumbles behind his abuser who ascends the
      quarry trail ahead of him. Never turning to face him, VAN
      BUREN recounts...

                             VAN BUREN
                       (calls out)
                   You were in quite a state last
                   night. Orazio carried you to bed!

      VAN BUREN hums Mina's "You are my destiny.'

                             VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                   It's a 4 hour train to the airport
                   in Fiumicino so you have time for a
                   rest. I hope your stomach isn't too
                   sensitive on aeroplanes!

      CLOSE ON -

      ERZSEBET composes a letter to her niece in an elegant script.
      A few banknotes sit in a pile to the side.

                             ERZSEBET (V.O.)

      ULTRA-FAST MOTION -

      Back in Doylestown, much time has passed. The site is active,
      abuzz again.

                             ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                   Don't be mad but your Uncle Laszlo
                   insisted I enclose a few banknotes
                   for you and Binyamin. We hope he
                   won't be offended, and that it's
                   not too difficult to change these
                   into the local currency.

      VARIOUS ANGLES ON -

      - Cargo is unloaded.

      - A cement mixer turns fresh concrete.

      - Cement floors are polished.

      - Grids of scaffolding are erected.

      - Tarps are pulled over church pews in the rain.

      - A large clock inside the institute ticks towards noon.

      SFX: DIEGETIC AUDIO IS MUTE.

      WE STEADICAM with LASZLO and his nemesis, JIM SIMPSON, older
      now, marching up a staircase through the action on-site.
      LASZLO and JIM SIMPSON feverishly argue but ERZSEBET's voice-
      over drowns out all diegetic audio.

                          ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                Here: I am so alone. Perhaps more
                alone than I have ever been. Your
                uncle has closed a door to me. The
                man I married is inside but the
                lock's combination, I cannot
                decipher...

      STEADICAM ON -

      LASZLO walks with a lamp closely observing the freshly laid
      concrete for the cistern

                          ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                He no longer attends synagogue.
                When I ask him why, he will not
                reply. Perhaps his own narcissism
                will no longer allow him a
                relationship with our community.

      LASZLO ascends a staircase and arrives out of the darkness to
      a picturesque sky to find...

                          ERZSEBET (V.O.)
                Tell me how you are. How you really
                are. All our love and warmth to the
                three of you.

      LASZLO stands with a small group of employees explaining a
      nuanced architectural detail.

                          LASZLO
                You see this, above us?
      There's a four inch gap between flats allowing sunlight to
      seep through above them.
                                                           112.

                       LASZLO (CONT'D)
             Measure the same distance of three
             or perhaps four inches between
             flats, and place each modular
             section apart by that same
             distance.

The CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR interjects...

                       CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR
             This isn't supposed to stay like
             this though. We just set it here
             for approximate placement.

LASZLO obsessively explains...

                       LASZLO
             I know it's not supposed to stay
             like this but keep it like this- I
             like it like this.

                       CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR
             What do we do with those gaps?

                       LASZLO
             We insert a thick sheet of glass
             between them to let the light in
             from above- give me some time to
             think about it and I come back to
             you.

LASZLO sees something in the distance which catches his
attention.

ANGLE ON -

ERZSEBET visits the site. GORDON, visibly older, pushes the
chair.

LONG LENS ON -

A YOUNG EMPLOYEE does pull ups on some scaffolding that's set
up around the base of the clock tower. The other young men
above him count down.

                        CONSTRUCTION CREW
                 (cheering him on)
             Twenty! Nineteen! Eighteen!
             Seventeen.

LASZLO comes upon them.

                       LASZLO
                 (shouts)
             YOU ALL STOP THAT RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S
             YOUR NAME? Are you trying to pull
             the thing down and get them all
             killed?!

The YOUNG EMPLOYEE's response is inaudible.
                                                         113.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          Your childish show-boating puts
          everyone else here at risk! Are you
          thick?! Are you lame?! You report
          to the subcontractor. You tell him
          that you've been let go.

A concerned ERZSEBET observes her husband shouting at the
YOUNG EMPLOYEE. She looks up at Gordon.

                    ERZSEBET
          Gordon, can you get him to stop
          shouting at everyone?

LONG LENS ON -

The YOUNG EMPLOYEE starts to walk off, seemingly mutters
something under his breath. An infuriated LASZLO runs after
the boy and kicks his behind. The gesture is equal parts
absurd and harrowing.

GORDON intervenes...

                    GORDON
          What's the problem here?

                    LASZLO
          It's already taken care of.

                    GORDON
          You kicked that boy.

                    LASZLO
          Stay out of it, Gordon.

                    GORDON
          What's wrong with you?

                    LASZLO
              (shouts)
          Stay out of it, I said, or you can
          go with him!

                    GORDON
              (affirmative)
          You shout at me again and you'll be
          sorry.

LASZLO considers this, swallows, then doubles down...

                    LASZLO
              (shouts)
          You too! Get out of here.

LASZLO marches toward ERZSEBET leaving GORDON behind him.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
              (calls out)
          Let's go home.

                    ERZSEBET
          I only just arrived!
                                                                 114.

      JIM SIMPSON enters the frame, on a mission, approaching
      LASZLO with a stack of paperwork.

                          JIM SIMPSON
                Mr. Toth, you and I need to talk
                through these May/June cost
                reports.

      LASZLO throws a hand up in the air to block out the nuisance.

                          LASZLO
                Not today, Jim!

                          JIM SIMPSON
                You can't just walk away every time
                I step into a room, Mr. Toth!

      LASZLO is maniacally defiant.

                          LASZLO
                Honey, have I introduced you to Jim
                Simpson? Jim is the boss' lap dog
                and Architectural Consultant
                Extraordinaire! He designed a hotel
                in Stamford.

                          ERZSEBET
                Laszlo, that's enough!

                          LASZLO
                There must be an unpaid parking
                meter around here somewhere, Jimmy!
                Be vigilant! Keep your eyes peeled!

      LASZLO and ERZSEBET are en route back to Manhattan. There is
      a palpable tension between them. LASZLO breaks the silence.

                           LASZLO
                    (cold)
                What is it?

                          ERZSEBET
                It was unnecessary how you treated
                that boy is all.

                          LASZLO
                Their safety is my priority.

                          ERZSEBET
                    (despondent)
                And Gordon, don't even get me
                started.

      ERZSEBET thinks, continues...

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                It is not what you said to that
                young man, it is how.
                                                     115.

                    LASZLO
          Would you like us to wait around
          another few years for another
          lawsuit to resolve itself? I am
          SICK of it. Do you hear me?!
Beat.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          I finish THIS or WE are finished.

ERZSEBET shouts.

                    ERZSEBET
          Speak for yourself! I am NOT
          finished. Living with you is
          impossible. You've become a selfish
          old bastard right before my very
          eyes!

                    LASZLO
          Don't say something you'll regret
          in the morning.

ERZSEBET hits him hard causing the car to swerve.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          You want to kill us?

                    ERZSEBET
          I'd get out of the car and march
          all the way back to Manhattan if I
          could, you egotistic scoundrel.
          There is NO REASON for me to be
          here. I am here for you! I could do
          my ridiculous job ANYWHERE! Do you
          think I went to university to write
          about lipsticks! Shame on you.

                    LASZLO
          WE CAME BECAUSE IT WAS OUR ONLY
          OPTION! Attila was here-

                    ERZSEBET
          WHO YOU REFUSE TO SEE!

                    LASZLO
          Ask him about that. Did he tell you
          that he kicked me to the street
          like a dog?

She is silent.

                    LASZLO (CONT'D)
          His bitch wife accused me of making
          a pass at her.

                    ERZSEBET
          You would never do that.

                    LASZLO
          I did NOT do that.
                                                           116.

                          ERZSEBET
                Why would she say such a thing?

                          LASZLO
                Because they do not want us here.

                          ERZSEBET
                Of course Attila wants us here.

                          LASZLO
                Not Attila.

                          ERZSEBET
                Who do you mean?

                          LASZLO
                The people here, they do not want
                us here. Audrey, Attila's Catholic
                wife DOES NOT WANT US HERE. We are
                nothing. Worse than nothing.

      ERZSEBET weeps.

                          ERZSEBET
                You poor man. My poor husband.

      ERZSEBET howls in pain, a recurring night terror.

                          ERZSEBET
                    (cries out)
                Zsofia!

      LASZLO tries to calm her.

                          LASZLO
                She's gone, darling. She isn't
                here. You must calm yourself.
                You've worked yourself up is all.
                          ERZSEBET
                I am in pain. I am close to death.

                          LASZLO
                You are not. I am so sorry I upset
                you.

      ERZSEBET weeps trembles. It's like an exorcism.

                          ERZSEBET
                Get me my pills, it's too much.

      The energy is frantic. She's wailing in the other room. He
      rifles through the medicine cabinet, opens her pill box. A
      half a pill drops out of an otherwise empty bottle.

                          LASZLO
                    (calls out)
                There is only a pill, cut in
                halves! Do you keep some in your

      LASZLO enters.

                          LASZLO
                There is only half. Do you keep
                more in your purse?

      ERZSEBET shakes her head.

      ERZSEBET writhes on the bed. LASZLO enters.

                          LASZLO
                I found something.

      She can't respond. He sits beside her and prepares a vein.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
                It's what they gave me on the boat
                for my broken face-

      He makes the injection.

                          LASZLO (CONT'D)
                Shh. You'll feel better soon, just
                listen to my voice, dear.

      A trance-like calm comes over her. He then prepares himself a
      dose.

      LASZLO lies in his wife's arms like a child. The light is
      beautiful. He looks up at her. She's like an angel.

      The room is very dark. The two of them make love. A cock, an

                    (Hungarian)
                I love you.

                 Do you remember everything you
                 confessed to me at home in our bed?

      LASZLO shakes his head, ashamed.

                           ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                 You needn't be ashamed, my darling.
                 The harm done unto us were done
                 only to our physical bodies.

      She smiles, laughs.

                           ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                 You were right. This place is
                 rotten. The landscape. The food we
                 eat. This whole country is rotten.

      She strokes his hand.

                            ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                 I'm going to Israel to be with
                 Zsofia and her child. I want to
                 become the grandmother to her that
                 she will, otherwise, never
                 encounter.

      LASZLO cries.

                           ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                 Come home with me.

                           LASZLO
                 I will follow you until I die.

      HOLD ON LASZLO... Softer, more beautiful than ever.

                To what do we owe the pleasure?

                          ERZSEBET
                Is your father in?

                          MAGGIE LEE
                We were just sitting down to
                dinner.

                          ERZSEBET
                No trouble at all. I'm happy to
                wait until you're all finished.

      MAGGIE LEE furrows her brow.

                          MAGGIE LEE
                Don't be silly! I'll have the
                kitchen fix you a plate.

                          ERZSEBET
                You're kind, Maggie, thank you.

                That explains it! Jim Simpson
                mentioned he hadn't been on-site

                It's going around. Please, sit
                down.

                Yes, something is wrong.

      The blood runs cold.

VAN BUREN shoots a look at her.

                    ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
          And for you people too. I don't
          know you but it will be difficult
          for you to hear.

          If this is a professional matter
          then perhaps you and I should talk
          in the other room.

HARRY stands.

                    ERZSEBET
              (calm, resolute)
          Your father is a rapist.

                    HARRY LEE
          Excuse me - whatever this is
          supposed to be, I don't like it.
          I'm calling your husband to come
          and fetch you.

                    ERZSEBET
          Your father is an evil rapist.

MAGGIE LEE believes her. HARRY rushes her.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          Don't push her, Harry!

VAN BUREN is silent.

                    ERZSEBET
          Look at him. He cannot say
          anything.

                    MAGGIE LEE
          Daddy, has something happened
          between you and Mrs. Toth?

                    ERZSEBET
          It wasn't me-

                    HARRY LEE
              (shouts)
          That's enough. You come in here
          making vague, laughable
          accusations! I want you out of our
          house this instant.

                    ERZSEBET
          Tell them what you did to my
          husband. Tell them what you did.

MAGGIE covers her face, horrified by the accusation.

                    VAN BUREN
          Your husband is sick. He is an
          alcoholic and a drug addict. I
          don't know why he wishes to hurt
          me, humiliate me.

                           VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                I have offered him nothing but
                kindness. He's a sick, senile old
                dog and when dogs get sick, they
                often bite the hand that's fed them
                before someone mercifully puts them
                down.

      VAN BUREN stands.

                          VAN BUREN (CONT'D)
                Now, if you'll excuse me, I've
                withstood enough abuse for one
                evening. You can tell your husband
                he's off the payroll now and
                forever, as well.

      ERZSEBET explodes.

                          ERZSEBET
                I WILL NOT EXCUSE YOU!

      HARRY starts violently dragging her out of the room.

                          MAGGIE LEE
                    (shouts)
                Stop it, Harry!

                          ERZSEBET
                YOU ARE NOT EXCUSED, HARRISON VAN
                BUREN!

      HARRY muscles her all the way to the foyer.

      He drags her all the way to the front door where she falls.

                          MAGGIE LEE (O.S.)
                    (shouts)
                Stop it, Harry!

                          ERZSEBET
                SHAME! SHAME ON YOU!

      MAGGIE LEE screams from off-screen and comes running to
      ERZSEBET's aid.

                          ERZSEBET (CONT'D)
                I'm fine, Maggie. I'm fine. Can you
                help me to my car? A taxi's waiting
                for me at the front.

      HARRY LEE opens the door and sets her walker outside.

                          HARRY LEE
                You never come back here, you crazy
                woman.

      MAGGIE gets ERZSEBET to her feet. They stumble to the front
      door and exit. HARRY LEE exhales, paces back and forth, then
      walks back to the dining room. The camera follows...
                                                              125.

      The guests are standing to leave.

                          HARRY LEE
                I am so sorry for the bizarre
                interruption.

                          GUEST
                It's all right, Harry. We'll leave.

                          HARRY LEE
                Don't leave yet. Please.

                          GUEST
                Your father's gone to bed.

      He walks down the hallway to his father's bedroom at the end
      of the hall. He opens his father's door. The room is empty...
      He turns back the way he came then stops at his father's
      study. It's empty, as well.

      ZSOFIA cries through her speech.

                             ZSOFIA
                   My uncle is, above all, a
                   principled artist. His lifelong
                   ambition was not only to define an
                   epoch but to transcend all time.

      She smiles.

                             ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
                   In his memoirs, he described his
                   designs as machines with no
                   superfluous parts, that at their
                   best, at his best, possessed an
                   immoveable core; a "Hard Core of
                   Beauty."

      ANGLE ON -

      A variety of models for both unrealized and actualized
      projects. The floor is littered with his life's work.

                             ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
                   A way of directing their
                   inhabitant's perception to the
                   world as it is. The inherent laws
                   of concrete things such as
                   mountains and rock define them.
                   They indicate nothing. They tell
                   nothing. They simply are.

      BACK TO -

      ZSOFIA changes course.

                             ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
                   Born in 1911 in a small fishing
                   village in Austria-Hungary, Laszlo
                   Toth looked out upon the Adriatic
                   Sea. He was a boy with eyes wide
                   open, full of yearning. New borders
                   would eventually rip this expanse
                   of sea away from him but never did
                   he cease to try and fill its void.

      ZSOFIA refers to her notes.

                             ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
                   Forty years later, he survived the
                   camps at Buchenwald, as did his
                   late wife, and myself, in Dachau.
                   His first American masterpiece, the
                   Van Buren institute outside of
                   Philadelphia, remained unfinished
                   until 1973.

                                                        129.

                       ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
             The building referenced his time at
             Buchenwald as well as the deeply
             felt absence of his wife, my Aunt
             Erzsebet.

ANGLE ON -

Architectural models of Buchenwald, Dachau, and the Van Buren
institute, side-by-side. The Biennale exhibit display their
similarities and differences.

                       ZSOFIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             For this project, he re-imagined
             the camp's claustrophobic interior
             cells with precisely the same
             dimensions as his own place of
             imprisonment, save for one
             electrifying exception; when
             visitors looked 20 meters upwards,
             the dramatic heights of the glass
             above them invited free thought;
             freedom of identity. He further re-
             imagined Buchenwald and his wife's
             venue of imprisonment in Dachau on
             the same grounds, connected by a
             myriad of corridors-

PUSH IN ON ZSOFIA -

                       ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
             -re-writing their history and
             transcending space and time so that
             he and Erzsebet would never be
             apart again.

ZSOFIA concludes by looking directly at her uncle in the main
row...

                       ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
                 (smiles and weeps)
             Uncle, you and Aunt Erzsebet once
             spoke for me, I speak for you now,
             and I am honored.

Her voice cracks with heartbreak.

                       ZSOFIA (CONT'D)
             "Don't let anyone fool you, Zsofia"
             he would say to me as a struggling
             young mother during our first years
             in Jerusalem, "no matter what the
             others try and sell you, it is the
             destination, not the journey."

HOLD ON LASZLO, a man at the end of his life at the beginning
of a new epoch.
