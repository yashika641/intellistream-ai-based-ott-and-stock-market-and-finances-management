                          You can't afford to be
                          sentimental. I'm asking you

                          gives us the upper hand. In
                          the long term, it'll cause
                          even more of a hardened
                          attitude towards us from the

                          status, it means ... well,
                          what it actually means is that
                          it'll make it less likely that
                          they'll negotiate with us, and
