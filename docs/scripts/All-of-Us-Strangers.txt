    INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK
1                                                               1

    A view of London stretches south past half-built tower
    blocks rising above the Victorian housing stock.

    This is the view from inside an apartment, twenty-seven
    floors up. As twilight comes, our focus shifts to Adam
    [45] gazing out the window.

    Something on the horizon catches his attention. It looks
    like the glint from a shard of glass or the light from a
    distant star: a guide, maybe a warning.


    INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - TWILIGHT
2                                                               2

    Adam wakes on the sofa, woozy from a dream. It is silent
    in the room; the sound of the city blocked by the triple-
    glazed glass.

    His flat is comfortable and well-looked after. Furniture
    is all carefully selected and the shelves are lined with
    books, DVDs and records.

    Adam lies still for a while, more than a while, watching
    light fade from the room. He sits up, switches on a lamp.
    His stomach grumbles.

    He looks down at his hands resting on his belly and rubs
    his thumb gently against his finger. The room is quiet
    enough to hear the sound of skin stroking skin, such a
    strange, sensual sound.


    INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
3                                                               3

    Adam opens the fridge door, the "buzz" of the appliance
    loud in the silence. There's nothing to tempt him, just
    leftovers and soggy salad in bags.

    He takes out his phone and orders from his `favourites'.
    Suddenly, the building's fire alarm comes on, a howl in
    the silence. Adam contemplates whether to ignore it.
                                                          2.


    INT. TOWER CORRIDOR - NIGHT
4                                                               4

    The alarm is louder now. Adam walks the long corridor to
    the elevator knocking gently on each door that he passes.
    He doesn't pause for an answer. He knows no-one is in.


    INT. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT
5                                                               5

    The alarm continues as Adam descends to the ground floor,
    his reflection thrown into infinity by the mirrors lining
    the walls.


    INT. TOWER LOBBY - NIGHT
6                                                               6

    The lift doors open. Adam passes rarely-used sofas, the
    rolling news playing on a large TV. There's no security
    guard at the desk.

    Blue lights from a police car travel across the wall and
    onto Adam. He turns to look for the car through the large
    glass windows but it has already passed.


    I/E. TOWER - CONTINUOUS
7                                                               7

    Adam heads through the doors into the landscaped gardens
    secured by a metal perimeter -- the meeting point in case
    of a fire. He's the only one to have left the building.

    There are signs of construction everywhere, new towers
    going up, but the cranes are still. Hoardings on his own
    block promise community through mocked-up photos of
    friends gathering in apartments and drinking on a roof
    terrace.

    Adam cranes his neck to look up at his building. There
    are few signs of life but Adam spots a faint glow on the
    sixth floor, the flickering light of a television. In
    that glow he sees the shape of a man. Watching him.

    The alarm suddenly stops. Calm is restored. Adam's phone
    pings. He checks the app: food is getting close. When he
    looks back at the window, the man is gone.
                                                          3.

    Sweet & sour pork balls lie half-eaten on the counter as
    Adam watches HELLRAISER by Clive Barker (1987), a classic
    (queer) horror with a soaring score.

    He is loading his vape with weed when the doorbell rings;
    an ugly, glitchy sound as if rarely used. He pauses the
    DVD. Adam is not expecting anyone.


    INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT / CORRIDOR - NIGHT
9                                                               9

    Adam opens the door to find a man in his twenties holding
    a half-empty bottle of whisky, shit-faced drunk, his eyes
    tired and heavy. This is HARRY (28).

    He wears a green sweatshirt with stains on the front. The
    corridor is quiet but for an extractor fan somewhere in
    the building, humming, groaning.

                            HARRY
              Hello.

                            ADAM
                    (cautiously)
              Hi.

                            HARRY
              I saw you looking at me from the
              street. I've seen you a bunch of
              times, coming and going with your
              head down. One day it will be for
              real, that alarm.

    Harry looks down the corridor towards the elevator. They
    can hear it open and close but no-one get outs.

                            HARRY (CONT'D)
              We're basically the only ones
              here. Can you fucking believe it?
              They still haven't got a security
              guard yet.

    He turns back towards Adam, anxious in Harry's presence,
    not wanting to engage.

                            HARRY (CONT'D)
              I'm Harry.
                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                             4.
9   CONTINUED:                                                      9

    He smiles, offers up his hand. Adam has no option but to
    shake it.

                              ADAM
                 Adam.

    The extractor fan stops. Harry searches for the source of
    the missing sound.

                               HARRY
                 How do you cope?

                              ADAM
                 With what?

                              HARRY
                 Listen?

    They both listen. Silence.

                               HARRY (CONT'D)
                 It's so quiet. London's out there
                 but we can't hear a fucking thing.

    Harry edges closer, almost conspiratorially. Adam backs
    away.

                               HARRY (CONT'D)
                 I play music but it's worse when
                 it ends. I even bought one of
                 those white-noise machines. It's
                 like someone's in the corner of
                 the room, whispering about me. We
                 can't even open the windows but I
                 guess they don't want us to jump.
                 Bad for business, bodies broken on
                 the concrete. Who's gonna move in
                 then? You want a drink? It's
                 Japanese.

    Harry lifts up the bottle. He really does seem fucked.
    Adam wants him gone.

                               HARRY (CONT'D)
                 It's meant to be the best in the
                 world but I couldn't tell you why.


                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                           5.
9    CONTINUED: (2)                                               9

                             ADAM
               No thanks.

     Harry looks at him for longer than is comfortable.

                             HARRY
               How about I come in anyway? If not
               for a drink then for whatever else
               you might want.

     There is a desperation to Harry's tone that is unnerving,
     his sexual intention clear.

                             ADAM
               I don't think that's a good idea.

                             HARRY
               Do I scare you?

                             ADAM
               Excuse me?

                             HARRY
               We don't have to do anything if
               I'm not your type.
                    (leaning in)
               There's vampires at my door.

     What a strange thing to say.

     Adam closes the door in his face. Adam waits, uneasy. He
     puts his ear to the door. Harry's still there.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Everyone is meant to be kinder
               nowadays but surprise fucking
               surprise, nothing has changed.

     Adam feels a stab of guilt, Harry's as alone as him, but
     he waits and waits until he is sure Harry is gone. When
     he finally opens the door, the corridor is empty. Adam
     closes and double locks the door.

     From the vantage point of a half-built tower, we zoom out
     as Adam walks to the window, taking a long drag on his
     vaporizer.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

10   CONTINUED:                                                   10

     Pulling out further, we reveal Harry's apartment on the
     sixth floor, the television still on. Harry is by the
     window finishing off his whisky.

     He starts to scream at the top of his lungs. Only no one
     can hear him through the triple-glazed windows. Not Adam.
     Not even us.

     Harsh cut to a new day, the sun watery, a warm summer
     morning.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
12                                                                12

     Adam flicks through his eclectic LP collection ordered by
     the year of release. The sleeves become more battered and
     torn as he goes back through time.

     He picks THE CIRCUS by ERASURE (1987). On the inside of
     the album sleeve is some handwriting, a little childish.
     It says `Dec 1987'.

     The title track plays as Adam sits at his desk trying to
     write a script. His fingers rest on the keys but nothing
     comes. The flash of the cursor taunts him, hovering like
     a heartbeat over the start of a scene.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DAY TO DUSK
13                                                                13

     Adam opens the top cupboard -- a place for comfort food.
     Devonshire Custard. Rice Pudding. He takes out a pack of
     Ginger Nuts and opens them.

     He eats two in quick succession, wiping the crumbs from
     his sweatshirt which fall to the floor with a sprinkle.

     As the sun sets, Adam stands by the window. He sees Harry
     sitting in the garden below. He looks forlorn, all alone
     down there.
                                                           7.

     A white noise machine plays the sound of the wind. Adam
     lies in bed, half-awake, half-asleep; that time of night
     when nothing feels entirely real.

     With a remote control, he raises the blinds just enough
     to see the horizon of the city. There is that glint, that
     shard of light beckoning him.


15   INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 15

     Adam takes a piss, a shower. He makes coffee. At his desk
     near the window he types on his laptop, looser and more
     curious. EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. 1987.

     He sits back, looks at the words, his cursor spiralling
     around the screen. He doesn't know what to write next.


     INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
16                                                               16

     Adam pulls out a plastic storage box from under his bed,
     the lid covered with a layer of dust. Inside are hundreds
     of old photos, random snapshots of a life.

     Adam flicks back through time as he did with the record
     sleeves; back through drunken moments in the noughties,
     university in the nineties, school in the eighties, long-
     vanished enemies and friends.

     There are other things in the box too: a few old birthday
     cards. Aged 10. Aged 11. Adam opens one, it says simply
     `Love from Mum and Dad'.

     Some diaries, school exercise books, some of them backed
     with old wallpaper to stop them falling apart. Some sugar
     packets from an American themed Restaurant. And a chrome
     RONSON VARAFLAME lighter. Adam tries it. It doesn't work.

     Then he finds what he's looking for: a photo of himself
     aged about two sitting in a red pedal car in the front
     garden of a semi-detached suburban house, his mother by
     his side. It looks like the late seventies.

     Adam smiles softly but not sadly.
                                                           8.

     Adam stands at the window in his bedroom. There is no
     sign of Harry this time but his attention drifts to a
     train heading away from the half-built tower blocks. He
     can almost hear the soothing rhythm of the carriage on
     the tracks.


     INT. TRAIN - DAY
18                                                               18

     Adam is on the train. The carriage is quiet. The sunlight
     flashes through the window. He closes his eyes and feels
     the warmth on his face.


     EXT. SANDERSTEAD STATION - DAY
19                                                               19

     Sanderstead is a suburb thirty minutes from London just
     south of Croydon. It is small and conservative but not
     particularly wealthy.

     Adam stands on the platform as the train pulls away. The
     station is quiet, only a few people around. It all seems
     familiar to Adam yet only half-remembered.


     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
20                                                               20

     Adam walks down a long ginnel flanked by wooden fences,
     taller than he remembered. There is a sweet melancholy
     that comes from being back. He hears voices behind him,
     some kids, but when he turns around, no one is there.


     EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY
21                                                               21

     Adam stands outside a small semi-detached house with a
     garage and a low-hedged front garden. He takes a photo
     from his pocket, the one with his mother and the little
     red car.

     Is this even the same house? There is now white render on
     the brick walls, and the window frames, once green, are
     black. There is even a new tree reaching as high as the
     roof.

21   CONTINUED:                                                    21

     Adam notices a YOUNG BOY watching from a bedroom window.
     It is hard to see him clearly. A WOMAN appears behind the
     boy, raises her middle finger and shoos Adam away.


     EXT. HIGH STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
22                                                                 22

     Adam walks along the high street: 1950's architecture,
     mock-Tudor, mediocre shops on the street level. Adam is
     caught by a scent sparking a memory.


     EXT. SANDERSTEAD PARK - AFTERNOON INTO DUSK
23                                                                 23

     Adam eats his chips at a picnic table near a playground.
     He flicks through a handful of photos brought with him,
     mainly of him and his Mum.

     In one photograph, Adam finds his 7-YEAR-OLD-SELF on a
     swing in the same playground where he sits now. Eating
     the same soggy chips.

     Adam walks through the park as the sun falls. TEENAGERS
     sit on rugs drinking beer. Some LADS kick a ball around.
     Somewhere is a game of cricket.

     He reaches a line of swaying trees, the wind picking up.
     Adam walks through the tree-line to find the landscape
     drop away with a distant view to London. Adam has no
     memory of this place.

     He sits on the ground as the sun sets. He watches the
     grass blow in the breeze. Suddenly the wind stops. A
     stillness falls. Adam turns around, sensing he's being
     watched.

     At the tree-line, he finds a MAN, younger than Adam,
     watching him. It is hard for him to see his face, the
     light obscure, but Adam feels a rush of adrenaline, a
     tingle of fear.

     With a subtle gesture, the man beckons Adam to follow as
     he walks back through the trees, the wind returning. Adam
     hesitates, then gets up.

     As Adam follows him from a distance, the light continues
     to fade, turning bluer and darker. Adam can't get a good
     look of his face. Before too long, the man arrives at the

     He stops. Turns back to Adam. Their eyes lock. The blood
     drains from Adam's face. Surely it can't be him? The man
     smiles, then crosses the road.

     Close to darkness now. The street-lights come on. Adam
     crosses the road as the man heads into an off-license.

     Adam approaches and cautiously peeks through the window,
     the dirty glass distorting the man's face. A car alarm
     goes off and Adam turns to find the source.

     When he looks back to the shop, the man is standing in
     front of him. He has a bottle of whisky (Bells, 1980's
     label) and a packet of fags (purple Silk Cut, 1980's
     label).

                                 MAN
                  Hi.

     The man offers Adam a cigarette. Adam shakes his head as
     if in a dream. The man lifts up the bottle.

                                MAN (CONT'D)
                  I thought something strong might
                  be good for a night like this.

     Adam tries to speak but no words come. The man smiles and
     lights a cigarette (with the lighter from Adam's box
     under the bed). He exhales a smoke ring into the air.
     Adam follows it skyward.

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                  Shall we go?

                                 ADAM
                  Where?

                                MAN
                  Home, of course.

     The man flicks the butt of his fag onto the ground. He
     stamps on it with his trainers, eighties in style.

     They have arrived back at the house from the photograph,
     but the red pedal car from his childhood is now there. A
     wooziness builds.

                                MAN
                  She's gonna be over the moon to
                  see you.

     The man knocks on the door. A car passes, an old Granada
     looking like new. The front door opens but from where
     Adam stands he can't see who it is.

                                MAN (CONT'D)
                  Guess who I found loitering in the
                  park?

                                 WOMAN
                  Surprise me.

     Adam recognizes the voice instantly. His eyes fill with
     tears. As the woman pops her head around the corner, we
     recognize her too.

     She is the woman from the photo. His mother. Only younger
     than Adam. And if this is his mother, then this man must
     be his Dad. She looks at Adam, unsure it's really him.

                                 MUM
                  Is it him?

                                DAD
                  It's definitely him. Look at the
                  eyes.

     Then suddenly, she sees.

                                 MUM
                  Yes.
                       (she smiles)
                  It is you.

                                 ADAM
                  Hi.

                                MUM
                  Don't just stand there. Get
                  yourself inside.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Adam doesn't even hesitate. He steps inside as if in a
     trance. His `mother' shuts the door behind him as we pull
     out wide to reveal the house.

     It looks different now (just for now), the white render
     gone, the window frames now green, and an orange Cortina
     parked in the drive.

     The room feels like it belongs in the mid-eighties. Adam
     sits at the kitchen table as his Mum gets a packet of KP
     dry roasted peanuts from the cupboard and puts them in a
     bowl. His Dad gets some glasses and opens the whisky. He
     pours the largest for Adam.

                             DAD
               So where are you living now? Not
               round here that's for sure.

                             ADAM
               I'm in London.

                              MUM
               How fancy.

                              DAD
               Whereabouts?

                             MUM
               Do you live by yourself?

     Adam downs his whisky in one. His Dad pours him another.
     His mother joins them at the table with the peanuts but
     no-one touches them.

                             DAD
               Do you own your own place?

                             ADAM
               It's just a flat.

                              DAD
               I knew it!
                    (to his wife)
               I told you he'd have done well.

                                DAD (CONT'D)
                  It can't be cheap living up there
                  in the smoke.

                                MUM
                  What do you do?

                                ADAM
                  I'm a writer. I'm not particularly
                  rich though, not really.

                                MUM
                  A writer?
                       (to her husband)
                  And what did I tell you?

     His mother cannot control her excitement. She jumps up
     and kisses Adam over and over again on the top of his
     head like he was a child, her child. He can't help but
     laugh, finally relaxing a little.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  I always knew you'd be creative.
                  What kind of writer? You know how
                  I love Stephen King. Carrie, Cujo,
                  Different Seasons.

                                ADAM
                  I'm not a proper writer. I write
                  scripts, a few films. TV when I
                  have to.

                                MUM
                  This is so bloody exciting. If I
                  knew the neighbours I'd run over
                  and tell them right now.

     She sits back down.

                                DAD
                  I've always said that writers know
                  less about the real world than
                  almost anyone else.

     He winks at his son to let him know he not serious; it's
     to wind up his wife. She bashes her husband on the arm.

                                MUM
                  What the hell do you know? You can
                  barely write joined-up.

        Adam smiles at this gentle mocking. It brings him back.
        His mum takes a cigarette and lights it, inhaling deeply.

                                 MUM (CONT'D)
                   A writer. Our son.

        That hits Adam squarely between the eyes. His Dad reaches
        over and places his hand on his.

                                 DAD
                   We're very bloody pleased to see
                   you doing so well.

        Adam looks down at his hand. It stays there long enough
        for Adam to experience his touch, his Dad's thumb gently
        stroking his skin. Then he reaches for the whisky.

                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                   But enough of that poofy stuff.
                   Our boy is home so let's get
                   fucking drunk.

        The `poofy' remark lands on Adam but he ignores it. He
        swigs down his whisky and hands the glass back for more.

        Adam lets the night wash over him. They are all drinking
        more and more. Still no-one eats the peanuts. Adam stays
        quiet, enjoying their stories of him as a little boy.

        We hear snippets. Like overlapping dreams. What about the
        time he wiped his poo on the anaglypta walls. Or that day
        he got hit by a Ford Granada when he tried to pedal his
        red car onto the main road.

        It is a little cold outside, a chill blown in. Adam's
        mother hugs him tightly, kisses him on the lips. His
        father does the same thing, a kiss full on the lips.

                                 DAD
                   It's been so bloody nice to see

                   would but here you are.

                               ADAM
                  I will.

     But there is a sense from Adam that this can't possibly
     be real, that it can't happen again.

                               MUM
                  Please.

     There is an insistence in her tone as if she needs this
     as much as him.

     Adam sits in the rear, his eyes heavy. A `traffic light'
     air-freshener hangs from the rear view mirror. It rocks
     back and forth.

                                TAXI DRIVER
                  Best get you home before your
                  missus sends out a search party.

     Taxi drivers always assume you have a wife. Adam says
     nothing. He smells his sweatshirt for signs of the night:
     smoke, booze.

                                TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
                  Out with your mates?

                  No.

     Adam tries to wrestle with the ramifications of tonight.

                                ADAM (CONT'D)
                  I was with my parents.

     Adam's eyes start to close as he watches the approaching
     city sparkle through the window. New buildings going up
     but the streets are quiet. A smile, almost euphoric,
     comes over his face.

     Adam, still a little drunk, heads through the lobby to
     the elevators. Harry is waiting at the lift with his back
     towards him. Adam considers and then decides to join him.

                             ADAM
               Hello.

                             HARRY
               Hi.

     Harry looks burnt-out, exhausted. He avoids eye contact.
     But the lift opens and they both get inside. The mirrored
     walls mean they can't ignore each other for long.

                             HARRY   (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry for the other night.

                             ADAM
               Don't worry about it.

     But Harry seems deeply ashamed, with a vulnerability now
     that Adam finds attractive. The lift arrives on the sixth
     floor and Harry gets out. Adam feels emboldened.

                             ADAM   (CONT'D)
               I do like whisky if you want to
               come --

     Harry turns back to Adam but the doors shut between them
     before anything else is said and Adam is left staring at
     his reflection in the textured steel doors. What a
     strange fucking night.

     Adam looks at the photos again. He finds himself aged 11,
     a melancholy kid. He stands beside his parents who look
     exactly as they did tonight, right down to the clothes.

     He lies back on top of the bed clothes. He holds the
     photo to his chest, a look of blissed-out exhaustion on
     his face.

     Delicate beads of sweat start to appear on his forehead
     but he doesn't seem to notice. He coughs, once, the photo
     jumps in his hand. He coughs again...

     The blinds are open, sunlight weak through the windows.
     Adam wakes slowly, hungover, undressed now. He sits up as
     if trying to remember a fading dream.

     Adam puts on a record: 1987's NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
     MUSIC 10. He chooses the track BUILD by THE HOUSEMARTINS.

     He lays some photos over the kitchen counter including
     one of his YOUNGER SELF AGED 9 stirring flapjack mixture
     with his Mum in the same kitchen as last night.

     Adam sits at this laptop, the music continuing. Writer's
     block seems to have gone. His mind is alive. As he types,
     his eyes redden with tears, not with sadness but rather
     something sweeter.

     Music is gone. It is quiet now. Adam stands by the window
     as the sun drops behind a cloudy sky, lights coming on in
     distant towers. He sees Harry again sitting down below.

     This time Adam uses a pair of binoculars to get a closer
     look. Sensing he's being watched, Harry turns to look up.
     Adam is embarrassed but waves softly anyway. After a few
     tentative beats, Harry waves back.

     There is a knock at the door. No doorbell this time. Adam
     opens up to find Harry standing there.

                  Hello.

                               ADAM
                  Hi.

                               HARRY
                  Hi.

                                ADAM
                  Do you want to come in?

     A beat of doubt as Harry looks down the corridor and then
     back to Adam. He smiles, tentatively.

                               HARRY
                  Okay.

     Harry takes in the apartment: the records, the books on
     the shelving unit. Adam hovers behind.

                                ADAM
                  How long have you lived in the
                  building?

                                HARRY
                  Long enough. I work for the
                  company that owns it. They rent it
                  to me for close to cheap. I work
                  from home most of the time anyway.

                                ADAM
                  What do you do?

                                HARRY
                  I.T. I wanted to do something else
                  but never worked out what that
                  something was.

                                ADAM
                  Do you want a drink?

     He turns around to face Adam.

                                HARRY
                  What have you got?

                                ADAM
                  Vodka. Some beer. Weed if you want
                  that instead.

                                HARRY
                  Weed is better.
                       (with a small smile)
                  I'm off alcohol.

     Harry's got a nice smile, kind about the eyes. He walks
     to the window to look at the view. Adam sits on the sofa
     and loads up his vaporizer. They are silent for a few
     moments, both a little awkward.

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  All these towers going up but
                  there is nothing to do. Do you
                  like living here?

                                ADAM
                  I bought it off-plan. I read that
                  was the smart thing to do. I'm
                  hoping it'll get better when
                  people move in. If more people
                  move in.

                                HARRY
                  You got friends nearby?

                                ADAM
                  Not really. You?

                                HARRY
                  Not really.

                                ADAM
                  Mine have all moved out of London.
                  They want gardens for their kids.
                  They want to be near grandparents
                  so someone can look after their
                  kids.

                                HARRY
                  I'm guessing you didn't want to
                  move too.

                                ADAM
                  What am I going to do in Dorking?
                  It's not for people like me.

     Adam inhales on the vape. Harry finally sits beside him.
     Looks at him.

                             HARRY
               You are queer, right?

     Adam exhales slowly with a smile. The room is so silent.
     We can hear every breath.

                             ADAM
               Yeah.

                            HARRY
                    (smiling)
               That's good.

                             ADAM
               Well -- gay. I can't get used to
               calling myself `queer'. It was
               always such an insult.

                             HARRY
                    (thinking on that)
               It's probably why we hate `gay' so
               much now. Gay meant lame and shit.
               Those trainers are gay. That
               haircut's gay. This sofa is gay.
               Your school bag's gay.

     Adam smiles. He takes another hit.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Queer does feel polite somehow
               though. Like all the dick
               sucking's been taken out.

     Adam laughs. Harry is happy he's made Adam laugh. It
     relaxes him. Adam hands the vape to him. There is a
     silence again.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               I'm assuming you're not with
               anyone. I never see you with
               anyone.

                             ADAM
               I'm not.

               Are you often single?

                             ADAM
               Often?

                             HARRY
               Uh-uh.

                             ADAM
               I suppose so. What about you?

                             HARRY
               Yeah. But not for want of trying.

     In the silence that follows, Harry inhales on the vape.
     Adam watches him. The action feels incredibly sensual,
     bringing an erotic charge. After he's exhaled, he puts
     the vape down and looks at Adam.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               How about I kiss you?

                             ADAM
               Okay.

     Harry leans close enough to Adam to kiss him but not yet.
     They look at each other, both getting hard. Harry smiles.

     Finally, Harry leans in. It is slow at first, then more
     passionate. They kiss for a while until Adam pulls away,
     breathless.

                             HARRY
               What is it?

                             ADAM
               It's been a while. I've forgotten
               how to breathe my way through it.

     It is Adam who leans in this time. They kiss some more.
     Harry tugs off Adam's top. He's a little self-conscious.

                             HARRY
               You don't need to worry about that
               with me.

     Harry takes off his own top, more confident. He undoes
     his belt, unbuttons his flies. Adam reaches out to touch
     him.

     Harry unbuttons Adam's jeans and rubs Adam's cock over
     his underwear. Adam tries to sit up, to feel Harry, but
     he pushes him back onto the sofa.

     Harry pulls down Adam's underwear and goes down on him.
     Adam closes his eyes, his lips falling apart.

     There is barely any light left. Adam and Harry sit still
     on the sofa, breathing deeply. Adam has cum on his belly
     and his chest.

     Harry leans over as if to kiss Adam but instead ducks to
     lick the cum off Adam's chest. As he comes up, Harry
     grins before kissing him. Adam pulls back at first, but
     then let's him.

     Harry wanders around the apartment only half-dressed as
     Adam puts his clothes back on. Harry finds the photos on
     the kitchen counter.

                              HARRY
               Is this you?

                              ADAM
               Afraid so.

                             HARRY
               You were cute. I hate my photos. I
               was a fat kid. If you're a fat kid
               no-one asks why you don't have a
               girlfriend.

     He looks at the photo again and smiles.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               We'd have been friends for sure.

     Adam likes the sound of that. Harry picks up a photo of
     his Dad smiling for the camera.

                                HARRY (CONT'D)

                  I'm trying to write something
                  about them.

                                HARRY
                  What does that mean?

     Adam looks at the photos.

                                ADAM
                  I've tried to not write about them
                  for years but all people want now
                  is the personal. It will probably
                  be good for me. Or not. Depending
                  if people like it.

     Harry smiles, then looks back at the photo of Adam's dad.

                                HARRY
                  I don't see my Dad much. Do you

               A car crash. Not the most original
               of deaths.

               That's horrible.

               I went to Dublin. I lived with my

               Fuck. I'm sorry.

                             HARRY
               I don't think that matters.

     Harry looks back at one of the photos. Adam is touched by
     the emotion on Harry's face.

     Harry can wait. He puts the photo back on the kitchen
     counter. It is of Adam in his dressing gown sitting with
     his mum on the stairs, red tinsel around the bannister,
     the age he was when they died.


     EXT. TRAIN - DAY
40                                                               40

     A rumbling train ploughs through a dark tunnel and out
     into a blustery day. The trees billow as storm clouds
     build in the sky.


     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
41                                                               41

     The clouds break. Heavy rain soaks Adam as he runs down
     the alleyway. Without an umbrella, he's soon drenched to
     the bone.


     EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY
42                                                               42

     It's still raining when Adam arrives. He hesitates before
     he knocks but his excitement at being back is clear. It's
     not long before she answers.

                              MUM
               Sweetheart!

                              ADAM
               Hi. Mum.

                             MUM
               You came back.

                             ADAM
               Of course I came back.

     Mum shuts the door. They stand in the hallway. The rain
     slows outside.

     Some of those photos from the box under Adam's bed are
     now framed on the walls. He knows it makes no sense but
     he doesn't care. He is just glad to be back.

                                MUM
                  You need to get those wet clothes
                  off before you catch your death.

                               ADAM
                  I'll dry.

     She comes over to him, fussing like a mother would to a
     young child.

                                MUM
                  Don't talk rubbish. You're leaving
                  a puddle on the floor.

     Adam takes off his jacket but he's soaked through. She
     starts pulling at his sweatshirt.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  Jesus, you're sodden. Take them
                  off.

                                ADAM
                  I'm not taking my clothes off!

                                MUM
                  Don't be silly, it's only me.
                  Jeans too, they're drenched. I'll
                  put them in the hot press.

     Unable to resist, or not wanting to resist, Adam lets her
     help him take off his sweatshirt.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  It's just me today. Is that okay?

     She seems insecure all of a sudden. Worried she won't be
     enough.

                               ADAM
                  Of course.

               Good because there's so much I
               want to know. I want to hear
               everything! C'mon, jeans!

     Adam takes off his jeans. He stands there in his under-
     pants and t-shirt, still damp from the rain.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               Now get upstairs and change.

                             ADAM
               Upstairs?

                             MUM
               To your bedroom!

     She makes a face as if he's being crazy and she heads off
     to the utility room. Adam rubs dust from one of the
     photos. We've seen it before, him stuffing his face with
     chips.

     Walking upstairs, Adam feels the bannister with his hand,
     looks up at the sky through the window, down at his feet
     on the thick carpet. Memories trickling back.

     His bedroom is the first room at the top of the stairs
     but he pauses before opening the door. A little afraid
     somehow.


     INT. ADAM'S OLD BEDROOM - DAY

     The past hits him hard. There is his old single bed. The
     walls plastered with posters from Smash Hits and Look-In.
     Toys in a box in the corner.

     His school books lie in a neat pile on his little desk.
     Adam opens the drawers to see pens and pencils, a half-
     eaten pack of ginger nuts.

     Some of the LP's from his apartment are here too. Adam
     picks up FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD'S `WELCOME TO THE
     PLEASUREDOME'.

     He opens the wardrobe to find his old clothes. His school
     uniform. He takes out the jacket and holds it up against
     himself. It looks tiny.

                  I guess nothing's gonna fit
                  anymore.

     Mum stands in the doorway holding some dry clothes.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  I got some of your Dad's things
                  instead.

     She hands them over, feeling Adam's T-shirt, still damp
     from the rain.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  T-shirt too. I'll dry it with the
                  rest.

     Adam dithers, then takes it off. She watches him closely.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  God. Look at you.

                               ADAM
                  What?

                                MUM
                  You were just a boy and now you're
                  not. You look totally different
                  and yet it's still you.

     She reaches out and touches his chest ever-so-gently. She
     touches him in the same place that Harry licked off the
     cum.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               I thought you'd be hairier. Like
               your Dad. I like a hairy chest if
               I'm honest. Christ. You know who
               you look like?

                               ADAM
               Who?

                             MUM
               Like my father. Or how I remember
               him when I was a little girl.
               Isn't that mad? It's like seeing
               both of you at the exact same
               time.

     She laughs away a few tears as Adam puts on his Dad's
     clothes, ill-fitting but with a smell he remembers.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               I wish you'd got to meet him, my
               Dad. You'd have liked him, always
               with the stupid jokes and silly
               puns.

     The oven suddenly pings repetitively downstairs,
     something ready.

                               MUM (CONT'D)
               I've   made your favorite. I hope
               it's   still your favorite. I'll
               make   some tea and then you can
               tell   me everything.


     INT. FAMILY HOME / KITCHEN - DAY

     Adam eats a gooey flapjack, more golden syrup than oats,
     perfectly cooked and fucking delicious. Mum takes two
     mismatched mugs from a mug tree and brings them to the
     table where a teapot is waiting. Adam's mug is from
     CHESSINGTON ZOO.

                             MUM
               Your Dad told me not to ask, and
               I'm guessing you're not married
               because I don't see a ring, but
               have you got a girlfriend?

     Adam smiles, awkwardly.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               I'm picturing her with brown hair,
               maybe curly, not too skinny. Smart
               obviously.

                             ADAM
               You mean like you?

                             MUM
               That's nice you think I'm smart.

     A long beat as Adam purposely chews on the flapjack,
     hoping to avoid the question. He hadn't imagined he'd
     have to come out today.

                  Do you?

                                ADAM
                  I don't have a girlfriend.

                                MUM
                  That's a shame.

     She seems disappointed. Adam considers taking another
     bite of the flapjack but puts it down. He struggles to
     find the words, amused at his own reticence.

                                ADAM
                  I don't have a girlfriend because
                  I'm not into girls, into women.

                                MUM
                  What do you mean?

                                ADAM
                  I mean I'm gay.

     His voice cracks with unexpected nerves. It is clear Adam
     still needs her validation, or fears her rejection. This
     is a surprise even to him.

                                MUM

               Forever.

                             MUM
               But you don't look gay.

                             ADAM
               I don't know what that means.

                             MUM
               It means what it means. You know
               what it means.

     She seems a little irritated by his news. She picks up a
     flapjack but puts it back down. Adam tries to use humour
     to diffuse the situation (a defense mechanism every gay
     person knows only too well).

                             ADAM
               I bet you're glad you don't know
               the neighbours now.

                             MUM
                    (ignoring him)
               I must admit, I'm a bit surprised.
               I'm not sure how to feel about it.

                             ADAM
               You never thought that it might be
               a possibility.

                             MUM
               Of course not. What parent wants
               to think that about their child.
               No parent I know.

     This makes Adam a touch defensive.

                             ADAM
               I'm very okay with it. I have been
               for a long time.

               So they aren't nasty?

                             MUM
               Does everyone know? Are you open
               about it, I don't know, on the
               high street, down WHSmiths?

     Adam's amused at the specificity of her fears, fears that
     somehow feel more about her than about him.

                             ADAM
               It depends on the high street. And
               yes, everyone knows.

                             MUM
               Don't you want to get married and

     Adam is not sure how to answer that.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               Do you want to get married and
               have kids?

     The very idea seems alien to her.

                             ADAM
               I don't know. It wasn't a
               possibility for such a long time.
               It didn't seem worth the effort to
               want it.

     There is a long beat. The sun goes behind a cloud, the
     room darkens. Neither were expecting this conversation
     today.

     Mum gets up and walks to the sink. She pours away her tea
     and looks out towards the garden, clearly a little upset.

                               ADAM (CONT'D)
               Are you okay?

                               MUM
               I'm fine.

                               ADAM
               Are you sure?

                             MUM
               I suppose I never did know what
               was going on in your odd little
               head. You were always running
               away. Do you remember?

                               ADAM
               Yes.

                             MUM
               There was the time you got to the
               train station but you'd lost your
               money on the way and couldn't buy
               a ticket.

                             ADAM
               Five pounds from Grannie.

                             MUM
               Yes. That was it. Where were you
               hoping to go?

                             ADAM
               I don't know. London I guess.

                             MUM
               Or the time you got as far as the
               bottom of the garden but cut your
               thumb on an old milk bottle. You
               came running back, all sheepish,
               blood all over your shirt, banging
               and banging on the window to be
               let back in.

     She comes back over and gently takes his left hand. She
     finds the scar, just the palest of lines on his thumb.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               There it is. Just.

     She sits down with a heavy sigh, remembering perhaps the
     sadness of her little boy. Adam rubs the scar with his
     forefinger (we've seen this gesture before).

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               They say it's a very lonely kind
               of life.

                             ADAM
               They don't say that anymore.

                             MUM
               So you're not lonely?

                             ADAM
               If I am it's not because I'm gay.
               Not really.

                             MUM
               Not really?
                    (a fear rising)
               And what about this awful ghastly
               disease. I've seen the gravestones
               on the adverts. Should I be
               worried about it?

                             ADAM
               Mum! Jesus. Please. It's very
               different now. It's all very
               different.

                             MUM
               Well. I guess I wouldn't know
               about that.

     The strange reality of their situation fills the silence
     that follows. A mother, younger than her son, living in
     the present but from a time in Adam's past.

     She finally picks up a flapjack and takes a bite. It is
     burnt. They all are now.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               Not enough butter. Are you going
               to tell your Dad?

                             ADAM
               I never thought I'd have to.

                             MUM
               Maybe it's for the best if I tell
               him. You know what men are like.
               He's a lot less open-minded than
               me.

                             ADAM
               If you think that's --

                             MUM
               I do.

     A strained silence follows. She's not angry with her son.
     Not at all. It is clear that she loves him but something
     hangs in the air that can't be fixed right away.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               Your clothes should be dry by now.
               You can take the flapjacks if you
               want. I'll not be eating them.
                                                          36.


     INT. TRAIN - AFTERNOON

     Adam stares out of the window at passing graffiti, moving
     as if animated. He is pretty okay with his sexuality but
     his mother's reaction has thrown him off-balance.

     A group of teenage boys sit close by. Adam turns to see
     one of the lads unselfconsciously raising his t-shirt to
     show the other boys his stomach. He catches Adam staring.

     Adam turns away quickly and looks out of the window. He
     is sure he can see the words poof queer faggot spray-
     painted onto the brickwork.

     It's there only a second before the train blasts into a
     tunnel with a violent shift of sound. His image appears
     in the dark reflection, his face stretched and contorted
     by the surface of the glass. It seems to express how he
     feels.


     EXT. TOWER BLOCK - LATE AFTERNOON
47                                                               47

     Adam walks back to his apartment, the sun bright and hot
     in his face. It is making him sweat.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
48                                                               48

     Adam closes the door and slumps slowly to the floor. An
     anxiety builds, a tension in the back of his throat. A
     nausea gathering strength.


     INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
49                                                               49

     Adam takes off his top. He's burning up, like he might
     puke in the sink. He tries to calm himself with short,
     shallow breaths.

     Looking in the mirror, Adam feel his glands. They seem
     tender and sore. In the reflection he notices five small
     lesions appearing on his chest.

     But when he looks down they are no longer lesions, just
     the outline of his mother's fingertips where she touched
     him. Adam traces them with his own fingertips when the
     door bell rings.
                                                          37.

     Adam, his t-shirt back on, opens the door to find Harry.
     He can see that something is up with Adam.

                               HARRY
               What's wrong?

                               ADAM
               I'm okay.

     Harry goes to feel Adam's forehead but Adam pulls away;
     not used to being looked after. Harry smiles, then goes
     in again with the back of his hand. Both of them enjoy
     the tenderness of this exchange.

                               HARRY
               You're hot.

                             ADAM
               It's probably just a chill. I got
               wet in the rain.

                             HARRY
               When did it rain?

     Adam doesn't answer. Harry looks at him.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Why don't you have a hot bath? My
               nan said there was nothing a bath
               couldn't solve. Literally fucking
               nothing.

                             ADAM
               I don't like baths.

                             HARRY
               Fuck off. Who doesn't like baths?

     Harry pushes past Adam into the apartment and heads to
     the bathroom.

                             ADAM
                    (calling after him)
               I don't want you catching whatever
               I've got.

                             HARRY
               You said it was a chill.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                ADAM
                  It is. I'm sure.

                                HARRY
                  So there's nothing to catch.


     INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     As the bath fills, the mirrors steam. Adam gets undressed
     still self-conscious getting naked in front of Harry.

                                HARRY
                  There's no need to be shy.

                                ADAM
                  Easier said than done.

     Harry comes close.

                                HARRY
                  I can close my eyes if that makes
                  you feel better.

     He pretends to close his eyes then takes a cheeky peak.
     It makes Adam laugh. He touches Adam's chest, the same
     spot his mother did. When Harry's hand leaves his skin,
     the red marks from Adam's mother are gone.


     INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
52                                                                  52

     Adam sinks into the bath, the water immediately bringing
     relief.

                                HARRY
                  Better?

                                ADAM
                  Yes.
                       (then)
                  I'm sorry.

                                HARRY
                  What for?

                                ADAM
                  This is not very sexy.

                                HARRY
                  Feels pretty fucking sexy to me.

     Kneeling beside him, Harry puts his hand under the water
     and strokes his chest.

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  I've been thinking about you a
                  whole heap today.

                                ADAM
                  Thinking what?

                                HARRY
                  When I saw you. Before. Coming and
                  going. I always imagined you were
                  smart. It was a relief to know you
                  were.

                                ADAM
                  Why do you think I'm smart?

                                HARRY
                  Just a vibe. I like you've got
                  `Walden' on your shelf. I've
                  always wanted to read it. Always
                  liked the idea of living in the
                  woods.

                                ADAM
                       (with a smile)
                  I haven't read it yet. But yes,
                  I'd like to live in the woods.

     Harry likes even more that he hasn't read it yet. Harry's
     hand moves a little lower under the water. It's taking a
     while for Adam to fully relax.

                                HARRY
                  I thought about watching crappy TV
                  with you on a Friday night. Eating
                  take away on your sofa watching
                  old episodes of Top of Pops from
                  before I was born.

     Harry leaves a pause. His hand goes down to his crotch.
     Adam tenses at first, smiles, then relaxes.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               I thought about something else
               too.

                             ADAM
               What?

                             HARRY
               I thought about fucking you. Or
               you fucking me. I don't care
               which. Are you into that?

                             ADAM
               It depends.

                             HARRY
               It's okay if you're not. We don't
               all need to be into fucking.

                             ADAM
               I wasn't for the longest time. For
               obvious reasons. Now it depends on
               who's asking.

                             HARRY
               Obvious reasons?

     Harry is wanking Adam off now.

                             ADAM
               You know. Aids. Terrified out of
               my mind. That I'd get sick and
               die. Even a blow job could send me
               into three months of sweats and
               swollen glands. I bet that's hard
               for you to imagine now, that fear.

                             HARRY
               A little.


     Harry leans in and kisses Adam as water slaps gently on
     the sides of the bath.
                                                             41.


     INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     On the bed, they kiss. Harry undresses. Soon they are
     fucking, facing each other. Slow and soft. We `feel'
     rather than observe. It is close, intimate. The walls
     seem to breathe, match their rhythm as they get close to
     cumming...


     INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
54                                                                 54

     Adam lies with Harry. Adam seems a little preoccupied
     with thoughts. Music plays on a bluetooth speaker. An
     insomnia playlist.

                             ADAM
               You said the other day you don't
               see you Dad so often.

                             HARRY
               Yeah.

                             ADAM
               And your mum too?

                             HARRY
               Yeah.

                             ADAM
               How come? They know you're --
               queer, right?

                             HARRY
               Of course.

                             ADAM
               And they're okay with it?

                             HARRY
               Yeah, they're okay. But they're
               pretty old-school. Less okay than
               everyone's meant to be. They've
               got used to it, sort of. If I
               don't say too much.

     Adam shifts in the bed, up onto his elbow, inviting Harry
     to talk.

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  You could say I've drifted to the
                  edge, right up to the edge, almost
                  over the edge.

                                ADAM
                  What do you mean?

     Harry turns over to meet him.

                                HARRY
                  Edge of the family. My sister and
                  her kids, my older brother who
                  just got married, they've got that
                  spot in the centre. But it's okay.

                                ADAM
                  Why's it okay?

                                HARRY
                  I don't go home much.

                                ADAM
                  Doesn't that make you sad?

                                HARRY
                  It's inevitable really.

                               ADAM
                  Why?

                                HARRY
                  I always felt like a stranger in
                  my own family anyway. Coming out
                  just puts a name to the difference
                  that had always been there.

     They are silent a while. Adam deep in thought. Thinking
     about today, of course. His mother. Her reaction. How it
     made him feel.

                               HARRY (CONT'D)
                  You okay?

                                ADAM
                  Yeah. It's funny though. It's so
                  much better now, of course it is.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               Most of the scabs have healed but
               it doesn't take much to be back
               there again, does it? Skin all
               fucking raw, feeling how you used
               to feel.

     Harry smiles with understanding. More than sex, it's a
     mutual understanding of something shared that brings
     deepening intimacy. Harry leans in and kisses him. As
     they break away...

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               Am I still hot?

     Harry feels his forehead again.

                              HARRY
               No.

                             ADAM
               Will you stay tonight?

     Harry nods. Of course he will. They cuddle up and drift
     into a deeper silence. But neither fall asleep just yet.
     Adam's eyes remain open, far too many thoughts in his
     head.


     EXT. TOWER BLOCK - DAY
55                                                               55

     A breezy summer day. Fast moving clouds. Adam sits at his
     desk, writing. It feels a little harder for him to work
     today. He looks up and out of the window.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
56                                                               56

     Passing clouds create moving shadows on the wall as Adam
     stares out of the window. In the reflection, a plane cuts
     a line across his neck.


     INT. TRAIN - DAY
57                                                               57

     Adam sits in the opposite direction of travel as if his
     childhood home is dragging him back. He sees a family at
     the end of the carriage.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

     A TUBBY BOY (9) with dusty blond hair sitting with his
     older brother and sister, looking out of the window like
     he might just cry.

     A train suddenly passes with a roar. It makes Adam jump
     and in the reflection of the window, his image flickers
     in the light, untethered.


     INT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
58                                                                  58

     Adam heads down the alleyway as the wind picks up. Fallen
     leaves blow across the ground as if Autumn has come.

     Three BOYS, around 13 in age and dressed in 1980's school
     uniform, pass in the opposite direction. Adam hears them
     laugh, whisper names.

     He spots an old five-pound note, wedged under the bottom
     of a fence (from the story of running away). Adam goes to
     pick it up when...


     INT. FAMILY LOUNGE - DAY
59                                                                  59

     The lounge has comfy sofas and textured wallpaper. Dad
     flicks through some LP's as Adam picks up an ornament on
     the mantlepiece, a figurine of a woman, a long-forgotten
     memory.

                                DAD
                  She'll be back soon, I'm sure.

                                ADAM
                  I wanted to talk to her.

                                DAD
                  I know you did.
                       (picking a LP)
                  This was your Grandad's favorite.
                  I never liked it at the time but
                  the sentiment's grown on me.

     He puts the needle on the vinyl. It is the same record-
     player we saw in Adam's apartment only now it looks new.
     The song is mournful and melancholy.

                                DAD (CONT'D)
                        (re: the figurine)
                  If you want to see your mum really
                  lose her shit go ahead and break
                  that bloody thing. Sit yourself
                  down.

     Adam puts the figurine down but doesn't sit down yet. The
     record crackles to life as Adam's Dad sits on his chair.
     He lights a fag.

                                ADAM
                  She told you then.

                                DAD
                  Yep. I was scared you wouldn't
                  come back. I hope you're not too
                  disappointed in her.

     Adam turns around to look at his Dad.

                               ADAM
                  I'm not.

                                DAD
                  She just needs to rearrange some
                  things in her head. Stories she'd
                  built up. She'll soon realise it's
                  not actually about her.

     Adam smiles. Waits a beat. Then sits down on the sofa
     beside his Dad. He might even take a drag of his fag.

                                ADAM
                  What about you?

                                DAD
                  What about me?

                                ADAM
                  How do you feel about it?

                                DAD
                  It was hardly a shock. I always
                  knew you were a bit tooty fruity.

     Adam laughs.

               You couldn't throw a ball for shit
               however much I tried to teach you.

                             ADAM
               You make me sound like a horrible
               cliche.

                             DAD
               Can you throw a ball?

                               ADAM
               Not at all.

     They both laugh again. Softly, and perhaps with a little
     regret.

     Adam pulls at a thread of material from the arm of the
     sofa. He wraps it around his ring finger. It makes the
     blood swell in his fingertip.

                             DAD
               Would you have liked me to have
               known?

                               ADAM
               I don't know.

                             DAD
               I would hear you cry in your room
               after school. Did the boys bully
               you?

                             ADAM
               Not just the boys.

               What would they do?

                    (with a shrug)
               They'd call me a girl. Refuse to
               play with me. Flick drawing pins
               at my face and flush my head down
               the loo.

                             DAD
               Kids are such little cunts.

     Adam smiles but it is a painful memory. He's silent a
     moment.

                             ADAM
               Why didn't you come into my room
               if you heard me crying?

                             DAD
               Why didn't you tell me what was
               happening at school?

                             ADAM
               You answer first. You can be
               honest.

                             DAD
               I didn't want to think of you as
               the kind of boy that other lads
               picked on. I knew that if I was at
               your school, I'd have probably
               picked on you too. I can't imagine
               that's very nice to hear.

                             ADAM
               I think I always knew that anyway.
               It's probably why I never told you
               what was happening to me.

     That makes his Dad sad, and a little ashamed. He looks
     over to the record playing...

                             DAD
               You know my dad thought I was a
               big softy too. He thought I had
               too many feelings for a boy.

     He stubs out the fag, gets up, and walks towards the
     record player. Adam snaps the piece of thread from around
     his finger, the blood coming back.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               I think that both of us, him back
               then and me with you, were just
               products of the time. Or is that
               letting us off the hook?

     Dad takes the needle off the record, having enough of the
     song.

               When she told me, I did think of
               some of the jokes we'd make. How
               we used to do impressions of your
               English teacher mincing around
               with his limp wrists.

                             ADAM
               You'd tell me over and over again
               not to cross my legs like a woman.

     He turns around to face Adam.

                             DAD
               Did I?

                             ADAM
               I still think about it every time
               I cross my legs.

     Adam's Dad looks deflated -- the weight of his mistakes
     weighing heavy. Adam can't help but want to soften.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               I have good memories too.

                             DAD
               I hope so.

     His Dad needs to know he did something right. Adam makes
     a gesture to the corner of the room.

               I remember how much you loved to
               decorate the tree. You went crazy
               for it. Every year. And you'd
               always let me put the fairy on
               top.

     His Dad remembers it well and his eyes bubble with tears.
     He comes over to his son.

                             DAD
               I'm sorry I never came into your
               room when I heard you crying.

                             ADAM
               Really. It's okay.
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                          49.

                             DAD
               It's not okay though, is it?

                             ADAM
               Dad. I get it. It was so long ago.

     But all of a sudden, Adam feels like he's back again, a
     young boy balling his eyes out in his bedroom not sure
     why everyone thinks he's a freak.

                             DAD
               Do you want a hug now?

                            ADAM
                    (voice cracking)
               Yes, please.

     Dad gets up and Adam follows. He lets his father hold him
     tight allowing his body to relax, collapse into his arms.

     Adam catches sight of the two of them in the mirror above
     the fireplace. Adam can see himself as an ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD
     BOY being held by his dad.

     As he returns home, Adam feels a lightness of being. He
     doesn't notice that some of the passengers are staring at
     him.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
61                                                                61

     Adam pushes Harry up against the wall and kisses him. It
     is playful and hot. He pulls off Harry's top, hungry and
     passionate, laughing, taking control.


     INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - DAY
62                                                                62

     Adam dries himself off after a shower as Harry gets out
     to join him at the mirror. He looks at Adam's reflection,
     pallid in this light.

                             HARRY
               You okay? I hope I've not being
               tiring you out.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                ADAM
                  No. I feel great.

     Harry comes up behind him, stroking his shoulder gently,
     kissing him on the back of the neck.

                                ADAM   (CONT'D)
                  Let's go out tonight.

                                HARRY
                  Really? Where to?

                               ADAM
                  `OUT' out.

                                HARRY
                  What do you mean?

                                ADAM
                  Have you been to Duckie? I think
                  it's still clinging on. I used to
                  go all the fucking time, too many
                  times.

     Harry is still resistant.

                               ADAM (CONT'D)
                  Please?

     Adam and Harry head out for the night, the tube is busy
     and boisterous. A straight couple that look queer make-
     out in front of them as if no-one is watching. Adam and
     Harry's reflections distort behind them.

64                                                               64

     `DUCKIE' is a famous queer night, an institution, and the
     queue is surprisingly long. A passing car blasts its horn
     but it's hard to tell if its condemnation or celebration.
                                                          51.

     Inside, it is packed, like a flashback to another time.
     The club is a converted Victorian pub with black walls
     and sticky floors.

     The music is loud: 80's new-wave and 90's indie. `I WANT
     A DOG' by the PET SHOP BOYS plays as Adam and Harry push
     through the crowds towards the bar.

     Both seem a little nervous but it doesn't take too long
     for them to relax. People dancing. Making out. Getting
     drunk.


     INT. ROYAL VAUXHUALL TAVERN - LATER
66                                                               66

     The music has changed. GRACE JONES and `LA VIE ON ROSE'.
     A gentle euphoria in the air. We gaze through dancing
     bodies as Adam and Harry drink fizzy pints of lager at
     the bar.

     Harry has nearly finished his pint already and is keen
     for another. He seems different in here, like something
     is being unlocked. Adam cups his hand to Harry's ear who
     can't really hear him.

                             ADAM
               Fuck me. I've missed this feeling
               whatever that feeling is.

                             HARRY
               I can't hear you.

                               ADAM
               Do you dance?

                             HARRY
               Of course. If I'm wasted enough.

                             ADAM
               Then let's get wasted.

     Harry downs his drink. Adam orders more. Adam talks about
     the old days, all the old clubs, all the guys he pulled.

     They both watch the crowd as the song reaches a glorious
     mid-climax, hands in the air, people together, very gay.
                                                          52.

     DEPECHE MODE and `SHAKE THE DISEASE'. Adam stands at the
     bar counter, struggling to get served. Harry is nowhere
     to be seen.

     Adam notices someone staring at him, barely out of his
     teens but full of swagger and confidence. The YOUNG GUY
     looks at Adam with something like pity in his eyes.

     Feeling a little paranoid, Adam checks his reflection in
     the mirror above the bar, rearranges his hair, the glass
     stretching his image. He is relieved to see Harry in that
     reflection coming back from the loos.

                             HARRY
               Look what I found in my wallet.

     He shows a baggy to Adam.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Fuck knows when I bought this.

                              ADAM
               What is it?

                             HARRY
               Coke, I think. Maybe.

     Adam catches sight of that confident kid again. What's he
     staring at? Adam looks back to Harry.

                              ADAM
               Let's do it.

     The bass of DEE-LIGHT'S `DEEP ENDING' pulsates through
     the walls of the cubicle, blasting louder every time
     someone opens the door to the bathroom.

     Two lines of powder are lined up on the cistern. It takes
     Adam a few goes to snort it and it catches the back of
     his throat. It's been a while.

     But Harry is clearly a pro. His line goes down with ease.
     Too much ease. He stands up, sniffs.

                  Shit. Doesn't taste like coke.
                  Think it's K.

                                  ADAM
                  Ketamine?

                                HARRY
                  Have you had it before?

                                ADAM
                  No. Will you look after me?

                                HARRY
                  I'll do my best.

                                  ADAM
                  Then fuck it.

     They make out for a while, messily.

     The music is louder now, the dance floor rammed. `DEATH
     OF A PARTY' by BLUR. A strange choice for a dance floor.
     A sexual, slow-motion car crash of a song.

     Glowing with sweat, Adam and Harry dance with lusty drug-
     fueled vigour. The young guy from the bar passes him with
     a few young handsome friends in tow. They all seem to be
     staring at Adam.

     Adam follows them with his gaze as they head to the side
     of the dance-floor and he catches sight of himself in the
     mirror over their shoulders. Adam slows down. He stops
     dancing.

     Only his reflection continues to dance, clothes damp with
     sweat, the mirror, the image, pulsating. Adam watches
     himself look up at the ceiling, arms aloft, letting go,
     grinning from ear to ear.

     Suddenly we are high above, gazing down on Adam as if we
     have become his POV of his out-of-body experience. As he
     reaches for Harry, pulling him close, making out, we
     crash towards them...
                                                          54.

     We are back in the flat. The song continues, pulsating
     heavy over images of time passing, of a relationship
     building.

     They stand naked in front of each other, still sweating,
     senses alive. We can literally see their hearts pulsating
     in time with the music.

     They sleep entangled, and in the morning, they kiss in
     the soft light of a new day. They make eggs. They taste
     good. Time throbs onwards as the sun rises and falls.

     Adam works, tired, skin clammy. Typing. Dreaming. They
     eat take-away on the sofa watching FRANKIE GOES TO
     HOLLYWOOD on an old `Top of the Pops'. They drink and get
     stoned and dance around like they're back in the club.

     They watch HELLRAISER curled up in bed on a projector
     screen. Harry is grossed out, laughing, needing Adam to
     protect him.

     Later, they lie opposite each other, a slight tension or
     fear as the lights of the club, blue strobes, start to
     flash through the windows.

     Back in Duckie again -- or perhaps some other club night.
     The music continues, sweat and strobing lights, throwing
     us in and out of darkness. Harry seems off his head, his
     eyes rolling back.

     Someone offers Adam poppers and he inhales deeply, the
     screen throbbing as he closes his eyes. When he opens
     them again, Harry has gone.

     He's somewhere off in the crowd. Adam sees him dancing
     with other guys. Is he kissing them? Are they kissing
     him? Does Adam even mind?

     He catches his own reflection in the mirror again. A howl
     of pain flashing in the strobe, an existential howl like
     the figure in Francis Bacon's `A Study after Vel�zquez's
     Portrait of Pope Innocent X'.

     Adam pushes through the   crowd, desperate to get a closer
     look. The strobe starts   to flash blue and in one of those
     blasts of light he sees   his mother drinking in one of the
     reflections. His father   too, drunk.

     Adam screams for his parents, screams for Harry but he's
     vanished. The clubbers around him start to get out of his
     way, fear and horror on their faces.

     Suddenly, Adam wretches into his hands. He stumbles and
     falls, through bodies and space until he hits the dirty
     floor...

     Adam wakes in darkness trying to work out where he is. He
     feels the texture of his sheets -- multi-coloured candy
     stripped winceyette.

     He reaches out to touch a patch of woodchip wallpaper on
     the wall that has been picked off.

     Adam opens his door to the landing upstairs. He wears a
     terry-cloth dressing gown, the carpet thick under bare
     feet.

     He walks down the stairs, he touches the banister again.
     There is red tinsel wrapped around this time like we have
     seen from old photos.

     Adam can hear music quietly coming from the lounge. He
     stops at the door. Slowly, turns the door handle.

     A fire crackles in the hearth. Mum and Dad unpack baubles
     that have been in storage. They've both had a few drinks.
     Adam breathes in the scent of the Christmas tree. `Top of
     the Pops' is on the TV. 1987.

                                MUM

     She looks at him, concerned.

                                  MUM (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong?

                                  ADAM
                  I'm okay.

                                DAD
                  You look like you've been up to
                  something.

     Adam is pale and clammy, his eyes dark with shadows. His
     mother comes over and feels his forehead with the back of
     her hand. Just like Harry did.

                                MUM
                  You're really hot.

     She looks back at her husband.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  He's very hot.

                                  ADAM
                  I'm fine.

     She looks at Adam as if wanting to say something, make an
     apology, but she can't find the words. Adam's Dad steps
     in. He holds up a brightly coloured bauble with a smile.

                                DAD
                  Get yourself over here.

     Adam likes the idea of that and he goes to decorate the
     tree. Mum comes to join them as the PET SHOP BOYS hits
     the 1987 No 1 spot on `Top of the Pops' with "ALWAYS ON
     MY MIND".

     After a few beats, she sings gently along with the song,
     almost to herself but loud enough for it feel like the
     apology she can't find the words for.

                             MUM
               And maybe I didn't hold you / All
               those lonely, lonely times / And I
               guess I never told you / I'm so
               happy that your mine / If I made
               you feel second best / I'm so
               sorry I was blind...

     Adam appreciates the gesture. She takes a few steps back
     and looks at the over-decorated tree.

                             MUM (CONT'D)
               Too much?

                             DAD
               No such thing.

     He hands Adam a fairy for the tree with a knowing smile.
     It's been a while since Adam's seen it. He reaches up and
     puts it on the top.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               Okay, get together.

     He has his camera on the side table, set on self-timer.
     The three of them gather around the tree and the flash
     goes off. They all smile. The Christmas lights flicker.


     INT. ADAM'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Adam is in bed now. His mum gives him two dissolvable
     painkillers that melt and fizz on his tongue. She looks
     at him still concerned but wants to reassure.

                             MUM
               You'll feel better in a jiffy.

                             ADAM
               Mum?

                             MUM
               Yes, sweetheart.

                             ADAM
               Do you think any of this is real?

                             MUM
               Does it feel real?

                                MUM
                  Then there you go.

     A flicker of fear in Adam's expression.

                                  ADAM
                  For how long?

                                MUM
                  I can't answer that. I suppose we
                  don't get to decide when it's
                  over.

     She kisses him on the forehead.

                                ADAM
                  Will you promise me you'll stay
                  home tonight?

                                MUM
                  Where would we go?

                                ADAM
                  To the Walsh's?

                               MUM

                  Just promise you won't go out.
                  Please.

                                MUM
                  I promise. We'll just be in the
                  bedroom.

     She leaves, closing the door. The room is thrown into
     darkness. Adam turns on to his side and tries to sleep,
     but he starts to feel sick.

     Blue lights seem to flash through the curtains. And then
     something else: a subdued crying from the corner of the
     room.

     Adam peers into the shadows, sure he can see himself AGED
     11, crying in the corner. Adam turns on the bedside light
     but there is no-one there.

     Adam comes out onto the landing. He spies a crescent moon
     through the frosty window.

     He taps gently on his parents door.

                             MUM (O.S)
               What is it?

                             ADAM
               I can't sleep.

     Adam pushes open the door against the thick carpet.

     Adam breathes in the smell of the room, familiar and
     comforting.

                             MUM
               Do you want to get in?

                             ADAM

                             MUM
               Of course.

     Adam's Dad grunts and rolls over, leaving a space for
     Adam in-between.

                             ADAM
               It smells the same in here. Aramis
               and Comfort fabric softener.

     That makes her smile. As Dad falls back to sleep, Adam
     and his Mum talk in whispers, almost sensual.

                             MUM
               You'd creep in here night after
               night saying you couldn't sleep.

                  You were scared of so many things:
                  murderers breaking in, rabies,
                  nuclear war. Do people still get
                  rabies?

                                 ADAM
                  Not so much.

                                MUM
                  I was desperate for you to grow up
                  just so I could get a good night's
                  sleep.

                                 ADAM
                  I'm sorry.

                                MUM
                  Why are you sorry? I'm the sorry
                  one. I should have relished you
                  driving me bananas.

     Adam smiles. It softens his anxiety. Mum is silent a beat
     but she has a lot on her mind.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  After it happened, did Granny take
                  you to Dublin?

                                 ADAM
                  Yes.

                                MUM
                  That's what we thought. Why did
                  she want to move back to Ireland?

                                ADAM
                  She wanted nothing more to do with
                  England. She was done with the
                  place.

                                 MUM
                  Why?

                  She'd lost her daughter.

               Gosh. All gone. Were you okay over
               there with my mum? Did you fit in
               better? At school.

                             ADAM
               I made sure I did.

     She sighs heavy.

               you at the time you must have
               needed us the most.

                             ADAM
               That wasn't your fault.

               I hate even more that I wasn't
               around for you even before. Not
               really.

                             ADAM
               Why do you think that was?

                             MUM
               Why? I don't know. I was so
               anxious about it all. Restless
               too, for more. I'd like to think
               I'd have got better at it in time.
               Given time.

               You know when I was a teenager,

               plot it all out.

               Holidays we might have gone on.

               Disneyland?

                             ADAM
               Yep. My 14th birthday. It rained
               non-stop and Space Mountain was
               shut for repairs. We fought the
               whole time.

                             MUM
               Why did we have to fight?

                             ADAM
               Because that's what everyone did
               with their parents. They fought
               and bickered and pretended they
               were ruining each other's lives.

                             MUM
               Did we make up?

                             ADAM
               We didn't need to make up. It was
               enough to know that we got to come
               home together, back here.

     His Mum smiles, sadly, the imagined memory feeling almost
     real. But it isn't real. A fear creeps into the room. A
     knowledge that none of this can last.

     She looks at Adam with growing concern as sweat appears
     on his forehead, his anxiety building.

     She touches his brow as Dad turns over in the bed,
     putting his arm around Adam, rubbing his chest. It
     becomes almost sensual.

     Adam turns over to find it is no longer his Dad. It is
     Harry.

                             ADAM   (CONT'D)

                    (whispering)
               You shouldn't be here.

     Harry kisses him. Adam resists at first but then softens
     his gaze, relishing the intimacy, sinking into it. Until
     he notices blue lights flashing through the window again,
     brighter this time.

                             MUM
               Adam? What's happening? Who's
               there? Someone's here.

     She sounds increasingly panic-stricken. Adam turns over,
     but she's gone. And when he turns back to Harry, he's
     gone too.

     Adam is alone, the blue flashing lights of a police car
     spiralling across the ceiling. Suddenly, he is an ELEVEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY again. He gasps for air.

     Adam wakes, exhaling. He is on the train at the station.
     Everyone is getting off. On the platform, walking away,
     he is sure he can see Harry.

     The station is busy. Adam leaves the platform barrier and
     weaves through the rush-hour commuters, all ignoring him.
     He tries to keep his eye on Harry but loses him in the
     crowd.

     Adam pivots around to see his Mum in the distance, behind
     the barriers, urging him back to her. One of her eyes is
     missing, leaving nothing but a bloody hole.

     A tube roars onto the platform. Doors open. Passengers
     push in and out of the carriage without consideration.
     Adam gets in and stays standing.

     As the train jerks into the tunnel, the lights flicker.
     Adam thinks he sees Harry in the next carriage down but
     when the lights come back on he is gone.

     Adam is sweating now, unstable on his feet. He coughs,
     then again, more uncontrollable. People look up as a fear
     of contagion ripples down the carriage.

     The train bursts onto a platform. Adam spies old posters
     through the windows as the tube slows: Chessington World
     of Adventures, Drunk Driving, AIDS Awareness. As people
     get off, Adam goes to sit down.

     Hurtling forward through the tunnel now, Adam finds his
     reflection in the tube windows. He looks distorted, full
     of pain. It's as if his reflection is screaming, trapped
     in a circus mirror or a monstrous kaleidoscope. He tries
     to get up...

     windows of passing buses and cars.

     Adam staggers into the lift, his reflection bounced into
     infinity by the mirrored walls. He shuts his eyes and
     sinks to the floor.
                                                             65.

     The lift doors open and Adam stumbles to his flat. He
     calls out for help but no-one comes.


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
84                                                                 84

     Adam shuts the door and falls to the floor. He tries to
     control his breathing but he can't. Someone is knocking
     at the door, louder and louder, calling his name, we
     don't recognize the voice.

     Adam ignores it. He staggers to the bedroom, gets himself
     in bed, curls himself up into a ball as a hand reaches
     out for him in the darkness...


     INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN
85                                                                 85

     It is Harry reaching for him. He also seems shaken, as if
     he hasn't slept. The dawn rises through the window behind
     him.

                             ADAM
               Harry?

                             HARRY
               It's okay.

                             ADAM
               What day is it?

                             HARRY
               I wish I'd never found the baggy.
               I never could go anywhere without
               taking something.

                             ADAM
               What day is it?

                             HARRY
               Sunday.

                             ADAM
               How can it still be Sunday?

     Harry's eyes redden.

                                HARRY
                  You kept screaming out for your
                  parents in the club, over and over
                  again. And I didn't know what to
                  do, so I took you back here and
                  just lay with you until you fell
                  asleep.

     Adam is grateful for the care but is close to breaking.
     Tears build in his eyes but he tries to keep it in.

                                ADAM
                  I don't think I'm very well.

                                HARRY
                  No. I don't think you are.

                                 ADAM
                  Am I sick?

     Harry leaves a beat then...

                                HARRY
                  You look scared.

     The emotion in Adam finally breaks.

                                 ADAM
                  I am scared.

     Harry pulls him close as Adam's tears turn into sobs that
     sound like howls of pain.


     EXT/INT. APARTMENT - MORNING INTO AFTERNOON

     The sun drops lower in the sky as we push past half-built
     towers towards Adam's apartment. Inside, he drifts in and
     out of a restless sleep. Even when awake, it feels closer
     to a dream.

     He showers. He brushes his teeth. Studies his face in the
     mirror. He knows he looks worn out, consumed. He watches
     Harry try to make scrambled eggs in the kitchen. When he
     looks back to Adam, he gives him a gentle smile.

                                ADAM (PRE-LAP)
                  I was sleeping in their bed the
                  night they went out. I was meant
                  to go with them, Christmas drinks
                  at the Walsh's house, but I didn't
                  want to go. Their son was always a
                  dick to me at school so I
                  pretended to be ill.

     Adam and Harry, both exhausted and hungover, sit at the
     kitchen counter with the eggs barely touched by either.
     Maybe Harry is smoking now.

                                ADAM (CONT'D)
                  I tried to get my Mum and Dad to
                  stay in, but they'd never miss a
                  party.

     Adam takes a sip of tea from an old mug. We recognize it
     from his parents' house -- the one from CHESSINGTON ZOO.
     There is a knock on the door, the same knock we heard
     last night. Adam looks towards it.

                                ADAM (CONT'D)
                  Two police came to the door, a man
                  and a woman. It was dark outside.
                  Really cold too.

     Flash to a memory. We open the door, back at the house.
     The POLICEMAN is there, it is only him we see. He looks
     like Harry. We stay in this memory only for a moment.

                                ADAM (CONT'D)
                  I don't remember what she looked
                  liked but he had kind eyes and a
                  shadow of stubble like it was
                  drawn on. When he told me what
                  happened all I could think about
                  was wanting to touch that stubble.

     Adam shakes his head with a smile.

     Adam takes another sip of tea. What follows is recalled
     without too much emotion. As if being told about someone
     else.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               The car crashed after skidding on
               black ice. Both of them had been
               drinking. Dad died right away but
               they took Mum to St Mary's in
               Croydon. She died a few days
               later.

                             HARRY
               Did you get to see her?

                             ADAM
               You mean to say goodbye?

                             HARRY
               Yeah.

     Adam takes out a chip of porcelain from his mouth. It has
     snapped off the rim of the mug. He rubs it between thumb
     and finger.

                             ADAM
               Granny thought it would scar me
               too much. My mum was pretty fucked
               up. She lost an eye when she went
               through the windscreen.

                             HARRY
               Jesus.

                             ADAM
               I went looking for that eye. I
               didn't want anyone else to find
               it. I thought it would be by the
               side of the road staring up at me.
               I did find a tiny piece of
               windscreen glass. In my head it
               had blood on it but I'm not sure
               that's true.

     Harry smiles reassuringly but says nothing.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               The nurse said Mum woke up once
               before she died. She must have
               been really confused waking up
               like that, having no-one around
               she knew. My dad not there. Me not
               there.

                             HARRY
               I can't even begin to imagine how
               you felt. How lonely you must have
               been.

                             ADAM
               Truth is I've always felt lonely,
               even before. This was something
               else. A quiet terror. Like now
               I'll always be alone. Then as I
               got older it kind of solidified
               into a knot or a ball of tangled
               Christmas lights.

     Adam touches his solar plexus.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               It's not like I wanted to die or
               anything. I didn't want to be in
               that car. It's more like the
               future just didn't matter so much
               now they weren't around. Does that
               make sense?

     Harry seems to understand that feeling only too well.

                             HARRY
               Yes. I understand how easy it can
               be to stop caring about yourself.

     He reaches out and gently strokes Adam's arm. Adam lets
     that hang a moment in the air. It is reassuring for both
     of them to feel each other's touch.

                             ADAM
               It's why these last weeks have
               been so extraordinary. To actually
               care about something. To feel that
               a future might be possible.

     Harry can't help but think Adam is talking about the two
     of them. And he feels the same way.

                             HARRY
               Yeah.

     But Adam's expression darkens.

               Adam.

     In Adam we see something evolve; a decision to bring
     Harry further into the story. Harry shivers as if the
     window is letting in a draught.

                             ADAM
               Will you come with me?

                             HARRY
               Where to?

                             ADAM
               Home. To where I used to live. So
               you can see for yourself.

                             HARRY
               See what?

     Adam doesn't give an answer. Harry looks down at his
     forearm as all the hairs slowly rise.

     Adam is not alone this time. He holds Harry's hand. The
     sunlight blasts through the window and it's making Harry
     sweat.

     The once-decorated Christmas tree has been left in the
     driveway, brown and threadbare. Adam's red pedal car is
     there too, all busted up. The wind rustles the large
     trees in front of the house.

                             HARRY
               Should we be here?

                  These were saplings when I was
                  born. Can you believe that?
                  They're the same age as me.

     Adam knocks on the front door but there is no answer. He
     looks through the glass. There are no lights on.

                                HARRY
                  Whose house is it?

                  My parents.

                                HARRY
                  But who lives here now?

                                ADAM
                  It's okay. You don't need to
                  worry.

     But Harry is afraid. Adam knocks again, louder. The wind
     picks up; not a harsh winter wind but lighter. Delicate,
     more wistful. Stranger.

                                HARRY
                  Adam?

     Harry's voice sounds strained. Adam peers through into
     the lounge. It is dark. Nothing but shadows. He calls up
     to the front bedrooms.

                                ADAM
                  HELLO?

     Nothing. What if they are gone? Adam passes Harry and
     moves towards the gate by the garage. Harry can do
     nothing but follow.

     Adam bangs on the textured glass door at the side of the
     kitchen. No answer. The lights are off. Then again on the
     french doors at the back of the house. Still nothing.

     Adam takes some steps back into the garden for a view of
     the upstairs windows.

     No lights on anywhere, the curtains closed. Anxiety
     builds as the wind picks up. For both of them.

                                HARRY
                  We shouldn't be here.

                  Adam?

     Adam ignores him. He goes to the french doors. Bangs on
     the window again. Harder this time. Still nothing. Adam
     looks to Harry as if he holds the key.

                                ADAM
                  Where are they?

                               HARRY
                  Who?

     Adam cups his hand over his face to look through the
     glass, more manic now.

                                ADAM
                  My parents. This is our house. You
                  see the wallpaper? The table. We
                  had fish and chips every Friday at
                  that table so my mum could pretend
                  we were still Catholic.

     Harry is starting to freak out, his chest tight. Scared
     out of his mind. Terrified that Adam has lost his mind.
     He tries to be more forceful.

                                HARRY
                  I want to go home. Let me take you
                  home.

                                ADAM
                  This is my home.

                                HARRY
                  It used to be. Not anymore.

                                ADAM
                  They have to be here.

                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                          73.

     Adam desperately rattles the handle. Harry sees a flash
     of Adam in the reflection as a hysterical NINE-YEAR-OLD
     BOY tries to be let back in.

                            ADAM (CONT'D)
                    (desperate)
               MUM? DAD?

     Adam can feel his parents slipping away. Harry tries to
     pull him from the door, but Adam pushes him off, angry,
     afraid.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               You can leave if you want. I'm not
               going.

     It is Harry that spots them first. Then Adam. Standing
     through the windows, deep in the shadows of the house:
     Adam's Mum and Dad. They look, for the first time, like
     apparitions.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               MUM!
                    (to Harry)
               Can you see them? Tell me you can
               see them.

     In the reflection of the glass, Adam can see a terrified
     Harry stepping away from the doors into the darkness of
     the garden as his mum gets closer towards him.

     The pull for his parents, his need to be with them, is
     too strong. He ignores Harry as he vanishes into the
     background. Adam bangs his fist on the window one more
     time.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
                    (desperate)
               Please. Let me in.

     His fist shatters a pane of glass into thousands of tiny
     pieces, not like normal glass but like a shattered
     windscreen of a car.


     INT. MUM AND DAD'S BEDROOM - MORNING
91                                                                91

     Adam wakes in his parents bed to find Mum and Dad looking
     out the window, whispering to each other, the light soft.

     They seem older, clothes more worn. There is a dust sheet
     over the dressing table.

     Mum seems resistant to something that Dad is saying but
     Adam can't hear the words

                                ADAM
                  Why didn't you let us in?

                                MUM
                       (turning around)
                  You're awake.

                                ADAM
                  Is he here? Harry.

                               MUM
                  No.

     Mum sits beside him and lifts up his hand. There are no
     cuts from the broken window, only a raised red scar on
     his thumb. As she rubs it gently, it fades.

                                MUM (CONT'D)
                  But we did see him.

                                ADAM
                  I really wanted you to meet him.
                  Him to meet you.

                                MUM
                  I know. But I don't think it works
                  like that.

                                DAD
                  He seemed like a handsome fella
                  mind you.

                                MUM
                  Is he a special friend?

                                ADAM
                  You mean boyfriend? You can say
                  the word.

                                MUM
                  Is he your boyfriend?

                             ADAM
               I don't know. I think so.

                             MUM
               Are the two of you in love?

                               ADAM
               In love?

     Adam lets out a chuckle. As if the idea is preposterous.
     As if he doesn't quite believe Harry could be in love
     with him. Dad comes over and sits on the bed alongside
     them.

                             MUM
               Why's that so strange?

                             ADAM
               I don't know. I don't think I've
               been in love before. Not really.
               I'm not sure what it's meant to
               feel like.

                             MUM
               Oh sweetheart.

                             DAD
               He certainly seems to care about
               you, a whole heap. In my not so
               humble opinion.
                    (a beat)
               Do you think you'd like to be in
               love with him?

                               ADAM
               Yes.

     Saying it out-loud has a profound effect on Adam. That
     makes his parents happy. There is a long beat. Mum and
     Dad look at each other and smile sadly. They know what
     has to come next. Adam knows it too. It has drifted into
     the room like a ghost.

                               DAD
               Son --

                               ADAM
               Don't say it.

               We have to.

                               ADAM
               Please don't.

                             DAD
               We think it's best you don't come
               visit us anymore.

                               ADAM
               Mum?

                             MUM
                    (reluctantly)
               You're going to keep coming and
               coming, I just know you are. We
               can see what it's doing to you.

                             ADAM
               I don't care what it's doing to
               me.

     He pulls his parents towards him into the bed.

                               MUM
               Yes you do.

                             ADAM
               What if I come less? Just once in
               a while, now and then. Only at
               Christmas.

                             DAD
               You have to have known this
               wouldn't last forever.

                             ADAM
               I'm not asking for forever but
               it's not been long enough. It's
               not been anywhere near close to
               long enough.

                             MUM
               How could it ever be?

     Dad gently takes control.

               Listen. I've got an idea. How
               about we go to your favorite place
               in the whole bloody world? I'm
               sure it's still there.

                             MUM
               Next best thing to Disneyland.

                             DAD
               And a damn sight cheaper.

     Adam laughs gently.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               What do you think?

                             MUM
               Tiger?

     Adam nods. He knows it is the right choice, the only and
     inevitable choice.

     The family arrive at the WHITGIFT CENTRE, a brutalist
     concrete shopping centre, faded, falling apart. Inside,
     it is virtually empty as they take the escalator to the

     The restaurant is adorned with American flags and cheap
     paraphernalia. Adam sits opposite his parents, who both
     try to be light and jovial. There is no-one else there.

     The waitress comes over but her eye contact is only with
     Adam. He tries to summon the same spirit as his parents.
     To give this `last supper' some joy.

                             ADAM
               It's not very busy.

     He looks at the menu. His parents too. The waitress is
     silent. She doesn't look in their direction.

     The waitress arrives quicker than expected with the
     `family special', a large tray of burgers, shakes and
     fries.

     They start to laugh. It's contagious, the three of them
     together. After a while, the laughs fade. Mum and Dad
     seem tired, eyes watery and distant as if whatever exists
     inside is fading.

                             DAD
               What do you think we should say to
               each other? I'm not sure I've much
               wisdom to share. Maybe Adam, being
               older, should be sharing some with
               us!

               Maybe we don't need to say
               anything.

                             DAD
               Maybe. Although I will say that
               getting to know you has made us
               very proud.

                             ADAM
               I'm not sure I've done much to be
               proud of. I've muddled through at
               best.

                             DAD
               But you've got through it, some
               very tough times, I'm sure. And
               you're still here. That's what
               we're proud of.

     Adam throat tightens. Dad's voice gets quiet. His eyes
     cloud over. He seems a little drunk.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               Wow. Fuck. I'm feeling, I don't
               know what I'm feeling...

                             ADAM
               Dad?

                             DAD
               Yes, son.

                    (his voice cracking)
               Stay a bit longer.

                             DAD
               I don't think so.

     Adam's Mum takes her husband's hand.

                             MUM
               I love you, darling.

                             DAD
               You sure? Sometimes I was never so
               sure.

                             MUM
               Whatever problems we had, I'm glad
               I get to be with you at the end.

                             DAD
               Me too. You always did feel a
               little bit like my lifeboat.

     She reaches out and strokes his face, gently. Kisses him.
     Dad likes that. He looks back at Adam.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               I know I was never good at saying
               it -- I couldn't get the words
               out, but I do love you, very much.
               Somehow even more now that I know
               you.

     That is almost too much for Adam, his eyes filling with
     tears, his face crumpling. His Dad takes his hand and
     holds it tight.

                             DAD (CONT'D)
               It's important you believe me.

                             ADAM
               I do. And I love you too Dad.

     Suddenly his Dad exhales heavy and slumps in his chair,
     life draining from his eyes.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
                    (voice breaking)
               Did you hear me? Dad?

     Mum gasps, reaches for her eye, inhaling sharply, her
     eyes tightly closed, terrified.

                              ADAM (CONT'D)
               Mum?

     Her eyes open wide in a panic.

                             MUM
               Adam? Are you there?

                              ADAM
               Yes.

                             MUM
               I can't see you. Why can't I see
               you? Are you there?

     Adam reaches out and takes the hand that covers her eye.
     He brings it back to the table.

                             ADAM
               I'm here, Mum.

                             MUM
               Oh yes. There you are. I can feel
               you. Your skin is warm.

                             ADAM
               It's okay. I'm here.

     Adam looks down at her hand now in his own, her skin
     almost transparent like she is now eighty years old, as
     if they have had a full life together.

                             MUM
               Promise me you'll try with this
               Harry boy. I'd have liked him, I
               just know it.
                    (a beat)
               He might need a bit of looking
               after mind you. Such a sad face.

     Adam doesn't answer.

                              MUM (CONT'D)
               You hear me?

                              ADAM
               Yes.

                             MUM
               Good. That's good. I hope you can
               make each other a little happier.

     She starts to sway a little as if she is seeing a song in
     her head, drifting away, but with a slight smile.

                              ADAM
               Mum?

                             MUM
                    (her voice faint)
               Are you still there?

                              ADAM
               Yes.

                             MUM
               You're such a kind and gentle boy.

     And then she is gone. They are both gone. Adam sits alone
     in the restaurant surrounded by burgers and fries, tears
     streaming down his face.


     INT. TRAIN - TWILIGHT
95                                                               95

     Adam returns on a busy train, surrounded by people who
     know nothing of what he's been through, laughing,
     talking, life carrying on.


     EXT/INT. TOWER - NIGHT
96                                                               96

     Adam returns to his block to find the alarm going off,
     just like on the first night. No-one seems to have left
     the building.

     Adam cranes his neck and looks up at the tower, only a
     few lights on. He hesitates but decides to enter anyway.
     He has someone he wants to see.

     As Adam heads into the lobby, we stay outside. We look up
     to catch the flicker of a TV coming from the sixth floor.
     The alarm suddenly stops.
                                                             84.


     INT. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As the lift rises through the floors, Adam's reflection
     seems normal. He looks into that image and gives himself
     a timid smile.

     He takes a photograph from his pocket: the one his Dad
     took of the three of them around the tree. Only now the
     photo is old and faded and Adam is eleven-years old.

     Adam feels a sense of calm looking at the photo, a sense
     of something having changed, and rather than put it back
     in his pocket, he finds a place for it in his wallet.

     The lift reaches Adam's floor. As the door opens, he
     makes a decision. He presses the button for the sixth
     floor.

     At first as he descends, he smiles. He checks his hair in
     the many mirrors. But slowly -- the closer he gets to the
     sixth floor, his mood changes. He can feel something.


     INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
98                                                                 98

     A strange reality hits Adam. He has never been to Harry's
     apartment. He doesn't know which flat is his. But he can
     hear a television playing.

     Adam follows the sound down the long corridor, louder and
     louder until he's finally outside a door. He knocks -- no
     answer.

     He knocks again. Nothing. Adam can feel in his gut that
     something is wrong. He tries the handle. It is unlocked
     and the door opens.


     INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
99                                                                 99

     The smell hits Adam first, stale and fetid. Dirty dishes
     and take-away boxes festering with mould. An old horror
     film plays on the TV. Adam finds empty baggies on the
     kitchen counter.

     He turns off the TV with the remote control. Silence now.
     He looks towards the bedroom, door closed. Every muscle
     stiffens.

                       (a near whisper)
                  Harry?

     Adam walks towards the door, fear building with each slow
     step. His fingers hover over the handle. Sliding the door
     open, Adam is hit by a sickening stench.

     He looks away. His heart racing. Adam tries to catch his
     breath. Then something dawns on him, a truth perhaps he
     has always known.

     He looks back to find Harry curled up on the bed, turned
     away, foetal position. He wears the very same clothes he
     wore on that first night.

     And there is the same bottle of Japanese whisky by his
     side -- empty. It's clear from the state of his body that
     he's been there some time.

     Adam edges towards Harry and sits by the side of the bed.
     By the man he has fallen in love with. He reaches out to
     touch the body but before he finds contact...

     A noise. The front door opening and closing. Adam gets up
     from the bed and walks out of the bedroom. He finds Harry
     standing there, wearing the same clothes as the body in
     the bed and is confused, agitated.

                                HARRY
                  I came to see you but you didn't
                  answer the door. Why are you down
                  here?

                                ADAM
                       (barely a whisper)
                  I came to find you.

     Harry notices the half-empty bottle of whisky now held in
     his hand as if he had no idea it was there. It sparks
     some kind of painful memory.

                                HARRY
                  I don't want you down here. You
                  shouldn't be here.

     Adam edges closer, keeping Harry from the bedroom door.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               I don't want you to see my place
               like this. Not like this. I don't
               understand why you're here.

                             ADAM
               I said goodbye to them and came to
               find you.

     But Harry isn't listening. It's as if Harry is piecing
     together what happened to him. The truth bubbling up. An
     agitation grows in him, a quiet terror. He spots the
     empty baggies on the kitchen counter. He picks one up.

                             ADAM (CONT'D)
               It's okay, Harry.

                             HARRY
               But it's not okay.

     Harry rubs his chest with his fist as if he has a knot of
     pain stopping him breathe. We have seen Adam do this same
     action.

     Adam comes closer as Harry thumps his chest harder and
     harder. In the window's reflection, and only there, Harry
     sees himself scream. Adam grabs Harry's fist in his own
     hand. Holds it tight. Harry's grip softens.

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Adam?

                             ADAM
               I'm here.

     Harry's eyes fill with tears, drowsier all of a sudden,
     drugs and drink through his veins.

                             HARRY
               I was so frightened. That night. I
               just needed to not be by myself.

                             ADAM
               And I'm sorry I was so scared. To
               let you in.

     But Harry's focus is now on the bedroom behind. As if he
     remembers what happened to him, as if somehow he's always
     known.

                Let's just go upstairs.

                              HARRY
                I can smell it, taste it in the
                back of my throat.

      He looks at Adam not in shock, nor anger, but terrible
      sadness. His face collapses on the brink of tears.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                How come no-one found me? Where
                are my friends? My brother and
                sister. Where are my mum and dad?

                               ADAM
                I found you.

                              HARRY
                But I don't want you to see me
                like that. Not like that. In
                there.

      Harry seems so ashamed with himself, disgusted almost --
      with the very idea of himself. Adam knows what to say. He
      has never been so sure of anything.

                              ADAM
                You are not in there. This is you,
                here. With me.

      Adam grabs hold of Harry as he breaks into sobs. Letting
      out the pain he has stored for so long. Adam knows that
      all that matters in this moment is that he eases Harry's
      pain. That is what love means. We push in close as they
      kiss through Harry's tears.

      It is dark, floating free from the confines of the tower.
      We are back in Adam's bed now. He has let him in. They
      lie together facing each other at first.

      Harry is grateful. They are silent a moment. Harry is
      getting sleepier and sleepier.

                                 HARRY
                   I saw her. Your mum. Your dad too.
                   At the house.

                                 ADAM
                   They saw you too.

                                   HARRY
                   They did?

                                 ADAM
                   My dad said you looked like a
                   handsome fella. They'd have liked
                   you. They both would.

                                 HARRY
                   That's good to know. Did you get
                   to say everything you wanted to
                   say?

                                 ADAM
                   I don't know. I got to be with
                   them

                                 HARRY
                   It's good that you were all
                   together.

                                   ADAM
                   Yeah.

      A long beat. Harry looks at Adam, glad he is not alone.
      Both of them glad to not be alone.

                                   HARRY
                   I'm scared.

                                   ADAM
                   I know.

                                 HARRY
                   What do you think happens now?

                                   ADAM
                   I don't know.

                              HARRY
                How long will this last?

      A beat. A memory of something Adam's Mum said to him.

                              ADAM
                I can't answer that. I suppose we
                don't get to decide when it's
                over.
                      (then)
                For now, why don't I just hold you
                a bit longer.

      Harry looks as if he may be about to say something but
      decides against it. They don't need to declare their
      love. Actions are enough.

      Harry turns over and lets Adam hold him from behind. The
      same position Harry was in downstairs. But now he is no
      longer by himself.

                              HARRY
                     (barely a whisper)
                It's so quiet in here. I never
                could stand how quiet this place
                was. Will you put a record on?

                              ADAM
                What would you like?

                              HARRY
                You choose.

      The piano introduction to THE POWER OF LOVE by FRANKIE
      GOES TO HOLLYWOOD starts to play. We don't need to know
      how. Adam whispers with the opening words.

                              ADAM
                I'll protect you from the hooded
                claw / Keep the vampires from your
                door.

      Harry smiles.

      As the song builds, Adam holds Harry tighter, comforted
      at last, cared for at last, no longer strangers. Harry's
      breathing slows.

      "Love is the light, scaring darkness away".

                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                           90.

      As the music soars, we pull away from them. It seems like
      they are almost dancing, swaying together, for how long
      we won't ever know.

      Further and further we come. Out of the room. Spiralling.
      Into the night. Adam and Harry fall away as we rise into
      the stars.

      Finally, as the music crescendos, Adam and Harry are no
      more than a glint in the dark sky.

      A guide not a warning.

      "Make love your goal".

                                            "THE POWER OF LOVE"
                                               CONTINUES AS THE
