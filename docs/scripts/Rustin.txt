     EXT. SIDE STREET - MOS

     A PETITE NEGRO GIRL, 15, is walking to school. During the
     above--

                         GEORGE WALLACE (V.O./ARCHIVAL)
               In the name of the greatest people
               that have ever trod this earth, I
               draw the line in the dust and toss
               the gauntlet before the feet of
               tyranny--

     We see reflected in her DARKENED SUNGLASSES, a MOB OF ENRAGED
     WHITE TEENAGE GIRLS yelling and cursing and threatening her.

                         GEORGE WALLACE (V.O.)
               I say segregation now, segregation
               tomorrow, segregation forever.

     EXT. FRANTZ ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOS

     A LITTLE BLACK GIRL, 6, is seen skipping down the street
     carrying a book bag and wearing a neatly pressed pinafore
     dress. During the above--

                         STROM THURMOND (V.O./ARCHIVAL)
               I wanna tell you ladies and
               gentlemen, that there's not enough
               troops in the army to force the
               southern people to break d own
               segregation and admit the nigra
               race...

     As the LITTLE GIRL continues to skip, the CAMERA PULLS BACK
     to reveal FIVE U.S. MARSHALS escorting her, followed by


     NATIONAL GUARDS.

                         STROM THURMOND
               ...into Our theatres, into our

               into our churches.

     INT. LUNCH COUNTER

     THREE TEENAGERS, two White, one Black, sit motionless, while
     a GANG OF WHITE HOOLIGANS gleefully assault the m with
     containers filled with condiments.

              That's part of American greatness,
              is discrimination. Yes sir,
              inequality I think breeds freedom
              and gives a man opportunity.

    INT. NYC OFFICE - DAY (1960)

    XCU ON: BAYARD RUSTIN, 48, handsome, regal, silver in his
    hair, brow creased, listening.

                        ELLA (O.S.)
              No more caution. No more delays.

                        RANDOLPH(O.S.)
              Six years ago, Brown vs. Board of
              Education became the law of the
              land, yet there is nothing in the
              Democratic platform addressing its
              enforcement.


                  MARTIN (O.S.)
              And the Republicans' platform is
              better?


                  RANDOLPH(O.S.)
              We plan on challenging them as
              well.


                  ELLA (O.S.)
              No free passes. Those days are
              done.


                   MARTIN (O.S.)
              So, you want me to lead 5,000
              Negroes into Los Angeles, utilize
              passive resistance to disrupt the
              Democratic Convention, and a few
              weeks later in Chicago, do the
              same? I'm sorry, but I am not your
              man.

    Bayard rises and steps into the fray--with a   swagger and
    panache he owns. REVEAL: A. PHILIP RANDOLPH,   a wisened 71,
    and ELLA BAKER, early 60s, sharp and strong,   sit across from
    MARTIN LUTHER KING, 30, and not yet the King   the world will
    come to know.
                                                 3.




                    BAYARD
          Who told you you're not 'our man'?
          Were you not 'our man' when you
          took command of the Montgomery Bus
          Boycott? Or spoke with such 1B.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          eloquence the night your home was
          bombed, or--

                    MARTIN
          You are conveniently forgetting I
          am now co-pastor of Ebenezer.

                      BAYARD
          Meaning?

                    MARTIN
          I cannot forswear responsibilities
          to my community, my congregation--

                    BAYARD
              (pointedly)
          What about your responsibility to
          your talent, your gifts?

Girding himself for the Rustin onslaught--

                    MARTIN
          'Heavenly Father I am forever safe
          in your hands.'

                    BAYARD
          When C.L. first heard you speak, he
          rang me and said: "Bayard, there's
          magic going on down here." Do you
          know what he saw? A star; the
          heavenly kind. And when that star
          starts to shine brighter than any
          other, and bows to no man,
          including the most powerful Negro
          leaders who have come before, they
          will do everything they can to
          extinguish your light, and put you
          in your place.

                      MARTIN
          Chief,   Mrs. Baker, I've received a
          number   of calls from prominent men
          within   The Movement who see no
          wisdom   in these protests; men with
          whom I   have a strong kinship.
                                                                 4.


                         ELLA
               Not once you leave the room.

     Martin looks to Randolph, who concurs with silence.

                         BAYARD
               Friend, one of my greatest joys is
               watching you rise. The Lord speaks
               through you. That direct line can
               lead us into Los Angeles, where we
               will most vigorously let Kennedy,
               Johnson, and the entire Democratic
               Party know, that unless they show
               up for our people, our people will
               not show up for them.

                          ELLA BAKER
               Yes ! YES! Yes.

                         BAYARD
               Do this, Martin, for the young, who
               don't know which way to go. Martin,
               own your power.

     Martin starts out shaking his head in disbelief, and ends up
     laughing and nodding in agreement.

A2                                                                A2
     INT. HARLEM - GREASY SPOON

     Jam-packed. Bodies on top of bodies. Bayard and Martin
     crowded together at a table.

                         BAYARD
               Best grits ever.

                         MARTIN
               Lest I remind you, I was born and
               raised in Georgia. My mother was--

     Once Martin takes a bite of the grits, he and Bayard both
     crack up laughing. Bayard, right again.

     As they eat--

                         BAYARD
               I'm proud of you.

                         MARTIN
               I'm proud you're proud.

                         BAYARD
               -and how's my beloved Coretta?
                                                                5.


                           MARTIN
                 She's fine.

                             BAYARD
                 The kids?

                           MARTIN
                 The second I set foot in the front
                 door: "How's Uncle Bayard?"
                 "Where's Uncle Bayard?"

                           BAYARD
                 And the self appointed noble
                 Negroes of the NAACP? Roy?
                 Congressman Powell?
                     (laughs)
                 Can't wait to see what they have to

                 say about us making the move on
                 L.A.

    Th e same   office, but there is now a vibrancy in the air. 'WAR
    MAPS' of    L.A.'S CONVENTION HALL fill the walls. Bayard is
    standing    before a group of DIVERSE YOUNG ACTIVISTS, who are
    thrilled    to see Martin Luther King by his side.

                           BAYARD
                 I am pleased and most proud to
                 announce that the Reverend Dr.
                 Martin Luther King, will be joining
                 us in Los Angeles--

    The ACTIVISTS APPLAUD. As Bayard continues, his hand casually
    rests on MARTIN'S SHOULDER and BACK.

     a conference table filled with NEGRO MEN IN SUITS, including
     Roy. They frame Martin, which causes him to appear smaller,
     younger, less in command.

                         BAYARD
               I assumed it would just be the two
               of us.

     One of the Men EXTENDS HIS HAND. After a beat, Bayard GIVES
     HIM THE LETTER, and watches as it is passed from HAND TO
     HAND, until it reaches Martin. Once he's finished reading,
     Martin forces himself to look Bayard in the eye.
                                                                9.


                         MARTIN
               We thank you for your many years of
               service.

     INT. NAACP OFFICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     As Bayard makes his way down the Hallway, it begins to dawn
     on him he's been ousted from the movement he loves, and by
     his friend whom he also loves. Bayard starts to walk FASTER
     and FASTER until--

                                                 CUT TO BLACK:


     ON-SCREEN TITLE: RUSTIN

     With the SOUND of a HISSING RADIATOR--

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. WAR RESISTERS LEAGUE - MORNING (JANUARY, 1963)

     THREE YEARS LATER. A DULL ROOM filled with DULL WHITE FACES.
     Bayard, thinner, haunted, is seated behind a desk, doodling.
     The PHONE RINGS.

                         BAYARD
               War Resisters League.
                   (instantly engaged)
               How many? Yes sir, right away!

13                                                                  13
     EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN / NYC - MORNING

     It is a CRISP WINTER DAY. Bayard, wearing a regal coat and
     Russian fur hat, is hustling his way past the EARLY MORNING
     CRO WD, when--

                         VOICE
               Bayard!

     Bayard looks up and sees MR. MUSTE, 75, pale and patrician,
     smiling/waving his arms. Behind him, THREE ELDERLY WOMEN
     (white) block one of multiple entrances to an OFFICE
     BUILDING. A WAR RESISTERS LEAGUE BANNER calling for an end to
     Nuclear Weapons, hangs overhead.

                         BAYARD
                   (joining Muste)
               When you said 3, I understood 300.
               And no press to speak of, save your
               nephew.
                                                         10.


Mr. Muste's NEPHEW-PHOTOGRAPHER waves.

                    MUSTE
          You're here. They're here.
              (calling out)
          Ladies...

Pulling Muste in, confidentially--

                    BAYARD
          I strongly suggest we cancel until
          early next week, which will allow
          time to stage a proper protest,
          worthy of our--

                    MUSTE
          I must kindly ask you again to not
          undermine my authority. White

                     BAYARD
          Sir, I assure you that was not my
          intention.

                     MUSTE
              (walking away)
          Ladies, Mr. Ru stin will take over
          from here.

Annoyed/turning on the charm--

                    BAYARD
          Who's up for the adventure of a
          lifetime; your picture in the Daily
          News--

Wrapping his scarf around one of the women--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          ...Hot coffee at the station?

                    MUSTE
          And lest we forget, preserving the
          planet and the lives of millions.

                    BAYARD
              (helping the women sit)
          All we have to do is take a seat,
          and New York's finest will do the
          rest.

As FO UR POLICEMEN APPROACH, the LADY IN BAYARD'S SCARF hands
it back to him and flees.
                                                               11.


                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
                   (to himself)
               And then there were 3.

     As the POLICE MOVE IN, so does the Nephew-Photographer,


     SNAPPING PICTURES.

     POLICEMAN ONE "helps" Bayard to his feet and leads him to a
     waiting PADDY WAGON. POLICEMAN TWO does the same to Lady One.
     When LADY TWO GOES LIMP, POLICEMEN THREE/FOUR carry her away.

                         BAYARD
                   (shouting to Muste)
               A.J., coming along?

     Bayard looks back and sees Muste taking the film from his
     N ephew's camera and pocketing it. As the Paddy Wagon DOORS
     ARE SLAMMED SHUT--

14                                                                 14
     EXT. TWENTY-THIRD STREET - AFTERNOON (JANUARY, 1963)

     The sun barely cuts through a hazy sky. Desperate for a
     shower, shave, and still wearing the same clothes from his
     arrest (three days ago), Bayard makes his way down 23rd.

     Towering over him: PENN SOUTH, three middle-income apartment
     buildings. On a nearby corner, a DRY CLEANERS. Bayard puts
     out his cigarette and goes inside.

15                                                                 15

     INT. PENN SOUTH / BAYARD'S APT. - MINUTES LATER

     A two-bedroom filled with GOTHIC and AFRICAN ART. Once Bayard
     steps inside, he LEANS AGAINST THE DOOR and CLOSES HIS EYES.
     He's exhausted and deeply sad.

     With the SOUND of RUFUS THOMAS' Walkin' The Dog, blaring on a
     cheap Hi-fi--

17                                                                 17
     INT. PENN SOUTH / RACHELLE'S ONE-BEDROOM APT.

     A party is going full force. Bayard, wearing a smart suit,
     African beads, looks as if he was headed to a more stylish
     affair, but made a wrong turn and wound up here.

     (Please Note: There is an energy in the room which suggests
     at any given moment something rawer/more intense could erupt)
                                                         12.


As Bayard works his way through the MAZE OF BLACK BODIES/
FACES laughing/dancing/sweating/shouting--

                    GIRL ONE
          I got a mama. I don't need no damn
          NAACP tellin' me to be patient--

                    MAN ONE
          I go south again, it's gonna be
          with a gun in my hand and Brother
          Malcolm in my heart!

ACROSS THE ROOM, Bayard sees TOM, 24, working-class handsome,
and one of the only two white kids in the room, downing cheap
beer and laughing with NORM, the 1963 version of a Negro
Nerd.

TWO DANCERS inadvertently shove Bayard in one direction. When
BLYDEN, 24, handsome, aggressive and more than halfway drunk,
GREETS/HUGS HIS BOYS, he shoves Bayard in another.

That's it. Bayard has had enough. Just as he is about to
leave, he spies RACHELLE, 22, smart/funny/tough (and the
other white person at the party), walking toward him with a
drink.

                    BAYARD
          "For I ne'er saw true beauty till
          this night."

                    RACHELLE
          You talkin' to the vodka or me?

                    BAYARD
          I take it there was some sort of
          protest?

                    RACHELLE
          It kinda got derailed, so I invited
          everybody back here. You?

Across the room, Tom and Friends launch into a drunken
rendition of Howard University's Alma Mater.

                    BAYARD
              (distracted by Tom)
          We commandeered the entrance to a
          building downtown, and mad e our
          demands known.

                    RACHELLE
          Tom's here.
                                                               13.


                         BAYARD
               I hadn't noticed.

     Turning his attention to CHARLENE, 19, edgy and petite.
     Indicating her SNCC button--

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Obscure fact about Miss Ella Baker,
               an early champion of SNCC.
                   (confidentially)
               She's Al Capone when it comes to
               cards: Tonk, Bid Whist, Crazy
               Eights.
                   (laughing)
               You're marvelous and have
               absolutely no idea who I am.

                         CHARLENE
                   (attitude)
               Like you know what I know.

     The second Bayard turns to go- -

                         CHARLENE (CONT'D)
               Who's that?

18                                                               18
     THE KITCHEN - LATER

     A BUNCH OF KIDS, including Tom and Norm, listening as TYRONE,
     21, talks, his speech slightly slurred. Blyden stands beside
     him. As Bayard eases into the kitchen for some ice--

                         TYRONE
               Door's barricaded, tires slashed,
               nnn-no escape. A fire bomb's thrown
               inn-side, folks start screaming. We
               finally get out. Onnn the ground,
               can't breathe, when this white
               man... "Buddy, you okay?" I nod. He
               takes this pipe and hits me, over
               ann-nd over.

                         TOM
               I'm so sorry.

                         BLYDEN
               Like we give a shit you're sorry.
               Was probably one of your uncles or
               cousins with that pipe.
                                                         14.


                                             BLYDEN (CONT'D)
             TOM
Raised in Brooklyn, go to        Y'all listening to this?
school in D.C. Why would I       Ain't-shit white boy talkin'
have cousins in Aniston,         shit.
Alabama?

                    NORM
          Tom isn't like that.

             NORM (CONT'D)                    TOM
In choosing to attend a noted    Norm... Norm--
Negro institution, Tom
abdicated being part of the
majority--

                     BLYDEN
          Betcha these two are card carrying
          members of Martin-de-Lawd's non-
          violence jamboree. So let's play.
          I' ll be the redneck.

Poking/punching Tom, with mounting intensity--

                    BLYDEN (CONT'D)
          Beat you so bad your body starts to
          scream. Beat you like they beat
          Tyrone. Beat you till you calling
          for your mama.

Tom snaps, slaps BLYDEN'S HAND AWAY. He and Blyden charge at
each other. Norm PULLS TOM AWAY, then BAYARD PULLS NORM,
until He and Blyden are FACE TO FACE.

                    BAYARD
          I'm the one that's been preaching
          passive resistanc e since before you
          were born, so hit me.

                    TOM
          Bayard, I can take care of myself!

On hearing Bayard's name, a light bulb in Blyden goes off.

                    BAYARD
          The pacifist is opposed to using
          violence, but must be prepared to
          receive it, only aim left. A
          policeman in '42 took care of the
          right.

Bayard smiles, revealing a MISSING RIGHT TOOTH.

                      BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Symmetry.
                                                             15.


     Bayard looks into Blyden's eyes and sees a wounded soul. When
     Blyden looks into Bayard's, he sees a man without fear.

                         BLYDEN
               I hear when King said git, you
               tucked your tail between your legs
               and swished away.
                   (backing away)
               You're-- irrelevant.

     Is that it? Bayard is privately amused.

                         BAYARD
               It's Friday night. I've been called
               worse.

     As the tension begins to dissipate, Bayard looks around. Tom
     is nowhere t o be found

19                                                               19
     INT. BAYARD'S APT. - LATER

     Bayard, wearing only a bathrobe, is pouring himself a drink
     when he hears AGGRESSIVE KNOCKING. The second Bayard unlocks
     the door, TOM BARGES IN: amped-up, horny, desperate to get
     rid of his edge.

                         TOM
               So what are you gonna do? White

                         BAYARD
               Offering up my face as a punching
               bag to a would-be Sugar Ray wasn't
               enough?

                         TOM
               Forget Blyden. We're enemies until
               he remember s we used to be friends.
               I'm talking about the party.

     Making Tom a drink--

                         BAYARD
               A party is hors d'oeuvres,
               laughter, Mambo for Latin Lovers on
               the Hi- fi.

     Tom, making himself at home, starts rummaging through
     assorted drawers, nonchalantly creating chaos as he goes.
                                                        16.


                    TOM
          Earlier today, a protest got
          cancelled because nobody could
          agree on the same chant. A fight
          almost broke out!

                    BAYARD
          Can I help you find--

                    TOM
          It didn't used to be like that. Now
          it's like that all the time. SNCC,
          CORE, CORE East, the NAACP kids,
          all fighting over agendas, slogans,
          songs. And do you know who's
          winning?

                    BAYARD
          Something tells me I'm about to
          find out.

                    TOM
          Bull Connor in Birmingham, Str om
          Thurmond on the Senate Floor.
          Faubus, Talmadge, Maddox, Wallace,
          while we all snap and snarl and eat
          each other alive.

Once Tom finds what he's been looking for: rolling papers, he
kicks off his shoes and begins rolling a joint.

                     TOM (CONT'D)
               (ribbing/flirting)
          Mambo for Latin Lovers? You are
          old.

                    BAYARD
              (flirting)
          Vintage. Intoxicating. Robust.

                     TOM
          So what are you gonna do?
              (laughing)
          Stop distracting me. The Mo vement
          needs you.

                    BAYARD
          I already have a job. Mr. Muste--

                    TOM
          Hates you because you possess
          everything he does not: charm,
          passion, a goddamn pulse.
                                                             17.

          Thomas--

                    TOM
          Don't call me Thomas.

                    BAYARD
          ...You've yet to learn it is unwise
          to speak of that which you do not
          know.

                    TOM
          He treats you like shit to keep you
          from getting 'uppity' and wanting
          to quit.

                    BAYARD
          I don't care if you were elected to
          Howard's Student Council--

            BAYARD (CONT'D)                    TOM
...There are words you are        Bullshit. You know I would
not allowed to use.               never--

                     TOM (CONT'D)
          Why don't you admit you're still
          hurt o ver what happened between you
          and Dr. King, so you'll use any
          excuse--

...Including working a job        SPECULATIVE!
you hate, to avoid
recommitting to a cause you       IRRATIONAL AND UNPROVEN!
love.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Just because you're smart about
          some thing, doesn't mean you're
          smart about everything.

                    TOM
          I've got the right to an opinion!

                     BAYARD
          And when it comes to my life, my
          past, especially as it relates to
          M artin, I've got the right to say
          ENOUGH!
                                                                18.


     The Two Men wind up seated next to each other on the bed. The
     display of anger has also given way to desire. Tom lights the
     joint.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               The last time I checked, that was
               illegal.

                         TOM
               The last time I checked, so were
               we.
                   (Takes off his shirt)
               I should go.

                         BAYARD
               Your language suggests one impulse,
               your actions another.

                         TOM
               Your eyes don't seem to mind the
               contradiction.

                         BAYARD
               The best advice I ever got fro m Ma
               Rustin: Never sleep on misery.

                         TOM
               Then I guess we shouldn't sleep.

     They KISS, begin to make love.

     A desk light SWITCHING ON; a SWIRL of CIGARETTE SMOKE as
     Bayard draws a RECTANGLE on a white pad; BAYARD'S HANDS
     taping a large piece of BUTCHER PAPER to the wall, and
     drawing TWO RECTANGLES: one SMALL, the other LARGE. Much
     larger.

21                                                                21
     INT. BAYARD'S LIVING R OOM

     Bayard at his desk, smoking, scribbling notes, when Tom,
     naked, sweetly places his head on Bayard's shoulder.

                         BAYARD
               I've had an idea. Want to be my
               assistant again?

                            TOM
               Of course.
                                                              19.


     Bayard eases away from Tom's touch, not out of cruelty, but
     because his focus is elsewhere.

                         BAYARD
               Get me the Randolph/Truman '48
               folder; that trunk over there.

     Tom recognizes this Bayard. Now that the warrior has been
     roused, whatever intimacy from the night before is gone.

     Tom (fully dressed) is seated on the couch, next to Norm,
     Rachelle, Charlene (the party girl from SN CC) and ELEANOR,
     22, articulate and poised. Bayard stands before them.

                         BAYARD
               Thirty years ago, Gandhi walked to
               the sea, picked up a handful of
               salt and inspired a movement that
               brought down an empire. The time
               has come for us to do the same.

     Using a marker, Bayard scribbles on the butcher paper, next
     to the smaller rectangle: LINCOLN MEMORIAL.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               We are going to put together the
               largest peaceful gathering in the
               history of this nation, the world.

                          ELEANOR
               How big?

                         BAYARD
               100,000 people.

                         CHARLENE
               Is he for real?

               A massive two-day demonstration
               with the power to shut down the
               White House, and Capitol Hill, made
               up of angelic troublemakers such as
               yourselves, with actions so bold
               and inspiring, the execution will
               demand all groups draw tightly
               together and become one. So let's
               hear 'em--
                                                             20.

     A SEAMLESS SMASH TO LATER--

     There are now FIFTEEN KIDS, hereafter known as THE TEAM,
     sitting on the couch/floor/windowsill. There are cartons of
     takeout scattered about, and cups of deli coffee are being
     passed around. BAYARD MOVES ABOUT THE ROOM, like a coach
     amping up his team before the big game.

                         BAYARD
               All your ideas. Talk! Shout! Take
               command!

                         ELEANOR
               What if we flood the offices of
               every member of the House and
               Senate, with delegates from church,
               labor, civil rights--

     Bayard gestures, 'keep going.'

                         ELEANOR (CONT'D)
               ...And in such numbers, the
               Legislative branch will cease to
               function.

                         BAYARD
                   (offering a marker)
               "Flood Legislative Offices." Write
               it on the wall.

     As Eleanor does--

                         TOM
               Impossible to train that many
               lobbyists in--

                         BAYARD
               No-no-no. Do not kill an impulse
               before it's born.

     The Other's mock/haran gue Tom.

                         NORM
               Picking up on Tom's concern and
               Eleanor's idea, what if instead of
               lobbyists, they're constituents
               from their respective states--

     Bayard starts gesturing--

                         NORM (CONT'D)
               ...Who refuse to leave until
               they've been heard!
                                                        21.


                    BAYARD
          Now that's collaboration!

Offering the marker to Norm--

                    NORM
          Technically it was an amalgam of--

The Team playfully harangues Norm. He draws on the butcher
paper a Capitol Building, and scribbles: "Constituents are
heard."

                    RACHELLE
              (teasing)
          Why can't you be collaborative like
          Norm?

                      TOM
          Shut up.

                    RACHELLE
              (singsongy)
          Somebody didn't go home last night.

                    BAYARD
          Rachelle. How many bodies does it
          take to surrou nd the White House?

                    RACHELLE
          How many? Sorry, I thought that was
          the setup for a joke. So you want
          me to literally--

                     BAYARD
          Day Two, we shall surround the
          White House and serenade the
          President.
              (singing)
          Ain't gonna let the President turn
          me around/Marching up to freedom
          land.

The Teams applauds.

                    CHARLES
          What about sleeping arrangements?
          D.C. has only so many Negro hotels.

                    CHARLENE
          How about tents? You know --

                    BAYARD
          A sea of tents; big and bold enough
          to unify an entire movement.
                                                              22.


                         CHARLENE
               Gimme that thing!

     As Charlene draws TENT AFTER TENT...

                         BAYARD
               And near the Lincoln Memorial, a
               stage where the Head of every Civil
               Rights organization can be heard.

                         ELEANOR
               Why just the Heads?

     The Room agrees.

                         BAYARD
               More! More!

     We're not done yet!

24                                                               24
     A SEAMLESS SMASH TO LATER--

                         BAYARD
               We started with two rectangles, and
               look--

     The CAMERA TAKES IN The Team, TAKING IN THE MAP, now littered
     with DRAWINGS/ PHRASES: Day 2 March, Stage for Speeches,
     Surround White House Sing!, etc.

     As Bayard continues, The Team hangs on to his every word.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               In order to make all of this real,
               each night, I want you to imagine
               these two days from beginning to
               end; every problem that needs to be
               solved, and every detail that must
               be fixed. I'll be doing the same.
               The work starts now!

     The Team, most of whom only met today, spontaneously breaks
     into small groups, arguing/debating, compl eting each other's
     sentences. Bayard smiles as the ENERGY IN THE ROOM CONTINUES
     TO GROW.

25                                                               25

     ELLINGTON'S Satin Doll plays on the phonograph. Randolph
     watches as Bayard and LUCILLE, 80, delicate, beautiful and
     quite ill, dance together. Bayard whispers in Lucille's ear.
     Her eyes and smile shine.

     As the MUSIC FADES, Bayard pretends Lucille isn't saying
     goodbye as HER FRAIL HAND gently pats his face.

     Bayard watches as Randolph escorts Lucille to a chais e and
     delicately kisses her on the lips. It's a level of intimacy
     and love Bayard has never known, and fears he never will.

27                                                                27

     Bayard and Randolph having tea.

                         BAYARD
               In '41, you called for a large-
               scale march to protest
               discrimination in the defense
               industry, but then cancelled.

                         RANDOLPH
               Roosevelt acquiesced to our
               demands, as did Truman in '48.

               Segregation in the Armed Forces.

                         BAYARD
               The time has come for another
               March.

                         RANDOLPH
               I can't. Not now. If Lucille makes
               it past the summer...

                         BAYARD
               We honor her by doing the work we
               have always done; the work the two
               of you did together.

     Randolph subtly nods, i.e., he's listening.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               I can handle all the grunt work:
               building a grass roots operation,
               rally the young. But when it comes
               to the old guard: Whitney, Jim--
                                                                24.

               Roy.

                         BAYARD
               Especially Roy, I'm considered a
               pariah. I need you, otherwise this
               march will never take flight.

28                                                                28

     An energized Randolph and Bayard are walking down the
     hallway. Tom follows after, carrying copies of The Plan.

                         RANDOLPH
               No matter what Roy says or does, I
               need you to behave.

     Annoyed by the word 'behave'--

                         BAYARD
               I do not have issues with Roy. It's
               Roy has issues with me.

     Off Randolph's look--

                          BAYARD (CONT'D)
               But in deference to both you and
               the cause, I shall sit in a corner
               and smile.

29                                                                29
     INT. NAACP OFFICE / CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Roy is seated at the head of a conference table, framed by
     FOUR LIEUTENANTS, middle-aged Blac k Men who wear their
     'Racial Respectability' with pride. Also at the table, MEDGAR
     EVERS, 37, intelligent, compassionate, and ELIAS TAYLOR, 29,
     handsome, self-effacing.

     Randolph sits opposite Roy, and true to his word, Bayard is
     seated in a corner, away from the table with the 'Lesser
     Staff': Secretaries, assistants etc. Roy has just finished
     scanning "The Plan."

                         ROY WILKINS
               And so, after a day spent flooding
               the Capitol and encircling the
               White House, so that the President
               of the United States cannot get in
               or out of his own home, our
               intrepid protesters would retire to
               tents, which now cover the National
               Mall. Day One.
                                                 25.


Randolph confidently smiles. No one else does.

                    ROY WILKINS (CONT'D)
          Chief, do you plan on pulling
          'this' together yourself?

                    RANDOLPH
          As we all know, there is only one
          person capable of organizing an
          event of this scale.

From his corner, Bayard smiles/waves.

                    ROY WILKINS
          Bayard, I was under the impression
          you were busy serving-- I mean
          saving white people from the bomb.

                    BAYARD
          I go where needed.

                    ROY WILKINS
          As opposed to when asked.
              (to Randolph)
          If memory serves me, this is your
          third attempt at--

                     BAYARD
          He did not-- Did he just say
          'attempt'?

                    ROY WILKINS
          Do you have something to say?

                    BAYARD
          No, except 'attempt' is hardly a
          word I'd used to describe the
          actions of a man who single-
          handedly is responsible for
          integrating both the armed forces
          and defense industry, but--

                     ROY WILKINS
          Mr. Randolph, I was about to ask if
          t his was once again a ruse to get a
          sitting president to yield.

                    RANDOLPH
          No, we intend to march.

                    MEDGAR
          Roy?
                                                        26.


                    ROY WILKINS
          Yes, Medgar?

                    MEDGAR
          Most of our folks in Mississippi
          have never been outside of their
          hometowns, so the opportunity to
          march with people from all over--

                    BAYARD
          There you go!

                    MEDGAR
          ...Will afford them the chance to
          discover, not only are they not
          alone--

                    BAYARD
          He gets it!

                    MEDGAR
          ...But are engaged in a struggle
          far greater than they ever dreamed.

                    BAYARD
              (shaking his hand)
          Thank you, Brother Evers.

                    R OY WILKINS
          Let just one Negro breathe wrong,
          and the entire D.C. Police
          Department will explode. White

                    BAYARD
          And the world will bear witness.

                    ROY WILKINS
          Chief, what size crowd are you
          projecting?

                    RANDOLPH
          100,000 people.

The Room explodes in disbelief.

                    ELIAS
          Mr. Wilkins, forgive me but that's
          impractical.

Bayard looks over and sees one of the handsomest men, ever.
                                                         27.


                    ROY WILKINS
          Elias is from Alabama. A field
          organizer. Perhaps you have facts
          to substantiate your claim.

Elias pulls out a paper. Bayard/Randolph share a look.

                    ELIAS
              (reading)
          Previous D.C. Demonstrations: In
          1913, 8,000 Suffragettes. In '26,
          25,000 Klu Klux Klan. The Prayer
          Pilgrimage in '57, 30,000. And in
          1932, 42,000 Veterans marched and
          were attacked with tear gas and
          tanks.

                    ROY WILKINS
          Who led the attack?

                    ELIAS
          The military.

                    ROY WILKINS
          And the Veterans' race?

                    ELIAS
          White.

                    ROY WILKINS
          White boys.

Case Closed. But not for Bayard. He rises, straightens his
posture and a FAUX ENGLISH ACCENT finds its way into his
mouth.

                    BAYARD
          Young man, your facts are correct,
          but your sense of history is not.
          Those 42,000 men marched on
          Washington D.C. because it was the
          Depression, and after dutifully
          serving their country, found
          themselves without jobs, and homes,
          and food to feed their families.
          And when they took to the street
          and were attacked, the world did in
          fact bear witness. Gandhi brought
          an empire to its knees--

                    ROY WILKINS
          Will someone please tell this man
          this in not INDIA!

                                                             28.
                         ROY WILKINS (CONT'D)
               For decades The NAACP has been
               getting Negroes out of jail. All of
               a sudden, they want to stay in and
               sing songs. And now you are
               proposing a 100,000 Black folks
               invade Washington D.C. Have you
               talked to Martin about this?

                         BAYARD
                   (nonchalant)
               I lost his number, he lost mine...

                         ROY WILKINS
               Dr. King, who hasn't lost my
               number, has come to understand that
               mass lobbying is sheer madness.

                         BAYARD
               Brown v. Boar d is the crowning
               glory of this organization, yet all
               across the South, when Negro
               children sleep, they see 'Whites
               Only' signs instead of their
               dreams. Counting on the courts to
               eradicate racial inequity, that's
               madness.

                         ROY WILKINS
               Mr. Randolph sir, you are a giant
               among men, but when it comes to
               this--
                   (i.e., The Plan)
               The NAACP says no.

     Roy/His Lieutenants go. Medgar follows, but not before giving
     Bayard's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

30                                                             30
     INT. NYC OFFICE BUILDING / MEN'S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

     Bayard is at a urinal. Elias enters. Though there are a dozen
     urinals, he unzips at the one next to Bayard. Silence, then:

                         ELIAS
               "When an individual is protesting
               society's refusal to acknowledge
               his dignity, his act of protest
               confers dignity on him."

                         BAYARD
               Why are you quoting me, to me?

                         ELIAS
               You're an inspiration.
                                                        29.


                    BAYARD
          Inspiration untethered from action
          loses all value.

                    ELIAS
          Who said that?

                    BAYARD
          I did. Just now.

Bayard zips up and moves to the sinks. So does Elias.

                    ELIAS
          I agree with Mr. Evers. At its
          core, your idea has potential. I
          would have spoken up, but it wasn't
          my place.

                    BAYARD
          It wasn't your place to voice
          support, but it was to help tear it
          down?

Bayard's had enough. As he turns to go--

                    ELIAS
          Your march is possible without The
          NAACP, but not without Dr. King,
          and Mr. Wilkins knows it.

Not so self-effacing after all. Bayard finds himself
intrigued, not only by the observation, but the man as well.

                    ELIAS (CONT'D)
          Elias Taylor. You looked like you
          were about to ask.

                    BAYARD
          I was about to ask something, but
          it wasn't that.

                    ELIAS
              (laughing/embarrassed)
          I was warned-- Whatever you want to
          say, you just say it.

                     BAYARD
          Doe sn't everyone.

                    ELIAS
          No. Most people are modest,
          cautious, afraid.
                                                              30.


                            BAYARD
                  So do it. Say what you are thinking
                  right this second. No caution, no
                  fear.

     Bayard waits. He's not backing down. Elias wants to, even
     tries to, but can't. Sensing Bayard's had enough--

                            ELIAS
                      (blurting out)
                  My wife is in town through Saturday
                  night.

     When a White Man enters, Elias deliberately brushes against
     Bayard's body and leaves.

31                                                                 31
     INT. NYC OFFICE BUILDING / LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     When Bayard emerge s from the bathroom, CLAUDIA TAYLOR, 26,
     calls out, her smile lighting the way. Tom watches from a
     distance.

                            CLAUDIA
                  Mr. Rustin! Claudia Taylor.

                              BAYARD
                  Have we--

                            CLAUDIA
                  Years ago. I volunteered for the
                  Women's Political Council during
                  the bus boycott. You spoke, and my
                  spirit soared. Elias!

     Elias is talking to one of Roy's Lieutenants when Claudia
     waves him over. Tom takes in Elias' sheepish approach.

                            CL AUDIA (CONT'D)
                  Have you two met?

                   BAYARD                          ELIAS
     Just now--                         Earlier.

                            CLAUDIA
                  Mr. Wilkins chose Elias to
                  coordinate efforts between national
                  and regional branches. Until he
                  takes over my Daddy's church.
                      (reassuring Elias)
                  It's only a matter of time.
                                                               31.


                          BAYARD
                I have no doubt, Mr. Taylor, you'll
                continue to impress your lovely
                wife's father. And such a vocation
                holds great rewards, celestial and
                worldly.

                          CLAUDIA
                A heavenly calling indeed, but once
                Daddy says yes, I expect a Lincoln,
                just like my Mama's.

      They all LAUGH. Only Claudia is fully sincere.

                          BAYARD
                I hope to see you both again very
                soon. Perhaps on the Sabbath?

                          CLAUDIA
                Sadly, no. I leave Saturday .
                Wouldn't that have been a dream.

      Bayard and Tom exit the building.

A32                                                             A32
      EXT. NYC OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

                           TOM
                Careful.

      Tom throws a look at Elias, who throws a quick look in
      Bayard's direction.

                          BAYARD
                I asked you to be my assistant, not
                "Mrs. Rustin." That is if you still
                want the job?

                          TOM
                Yes, of course. Yes. Yes. Yes.

      Before leaving the building, Bayard throws Tom a kiss, a la
      Dinah Shore: "Mawah!" Tom laugh s.

     Bayard and Randolph stand before the MANTLE as ALTER:
     photographs, mementos, etc, celebrating Lucille/Her life with
     Randolph.

                         RANDOLPH
               Years ago, we started a Shakespeare
               Society. Fighting racial tyranny by
               day, reciting 'What a piece of work
               is man' by night. Why is it no
               matter how hard you try, it's never
               enough?

                          BAYARD
               The day I came by and we danced, I
               told her about the march. The light
               in her e yes.

     LATER: Bayard OPENS THE DOOR to go--

                         ELLA
               Mr. Rustin, I see that you have
               arisen.

                         BAYARD
               You're merely witnessing the
               walking dead.

                         ELLA
               Don't make me embarrass my mama at
               such a solemn affair. Call me back.

     INT. 8TH AVENUE BAR - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

     Bayard and Elias are seated at the bar; a few MEN AND WOMEN
     scattered about. On the jukebox: DORIS DAY.

                         BAYARD
               The first time Martin invited me
               into his home , there were guns
               everywhere, underneath the sofa,
               inside the chiffarobe, guards on


               the front porch. Understandably so,
               given all the threats being leveled
               at his family and him. I started
               talking to him about passive
               resistance, and how our bodies are
               the strongest weapon we have. Over
               time, all the weapons went away.
                                                              33.


                         ELIAS
               So Dr. King's stance on non-
               violence, he got from you?

                         BAYARD
               By way of Jesus Christ, Ghandi,
               Thoreau.

                         ELIAS
               He trusted you?

                         BAYARD
               I always told him what I knew to be
               true.
                   (to Bartender)
               Vodka, water and--
                   (to Elias)
               How about a Manhattan? After two,
               you'll be a changed man.

                         ELIAS
               In that case, gimme three. No-no,
               just one please, thank you. Thank
               you.

35                                                              35
     INT. 8TH AVENUE BAR - JUMP TO LATER / EVENING

     Tip sy now, shirts loosened, Bayard and Elias haven't moved.
     The bar is fuller: WOMEN AND MEN.

                         ELIAS
               The man's asthmatic, can barely
               walk or breath, but the second he
               hits the pulpit--
                   (combustive energy)
               "The end of the world is at hand!"

     Bayard laughs.

                         ELIAS (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna burn in hell.

                         BAYARD
               For sharing how you feel?

                          ELIAS
               For not revering a man who welcomed
               me into his home, and hates my
               guts, and I feel the ex act same way
               about him!
                   (taking a large gulp)
               You're bad. You're good. I'll have
               another. Do you want--
                                                        34.


Bayard signals for another round.

                    BAYARD
          The church...your dream or hers?

                    ELIAS
          I have always wanted to serve the
          Lord. You were raised--

                    BAYARD
          Quaker.

                    ELIAS
          No!

                    BAYARD
          My parents, who were really my
          grandparents, raised me after their
          daughter, my mother, flew the coup.

                    ELIAS
          So... the rumors about you and Dr.
          King?

                    BAYARD
          An ugly lie perpetrated by Adam
          Clayton Powell to stop a planned
          protest. He threatened to share his
          lie with the press. I called
          Martin's bluff and resigned. He
          accepted, effectively ended my
          connection with The Movement.

                    ELIAS
          Why would Reverend Powell do
          something like that?

                    BAYARD
          Months later, Reverend Powell was
          made Chairman of the House
          Committee on Education and Labor.
          Not saying the two are related but--

                    ELIAS
          So, where is your resentment?

                     BAYARD
          Martin is a gift from God. I
          beli eved it then. I believe it now.

Sensing Bayard's sadness, Elias is about to place a hand on
Bayard's shoulder, but instead discretely touches his knee.
                                                             35.


                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               You're okay in here. At this hour.

     With his hand still resting on Bayard's knee, Elias looks
     around. The bar is now filled ENTIRELY WITH MEN; the windows
     covered, a Doorman stands guard.

36                                                             36
     INT. 8TH AVENUE BAR - A JUMP TO LATER / NIGHT

     Bayard/Elias at the bar, facing each other. Drunk, mostly. On
     the jukebox: Instead of Doris, LITTLE JIMMY SCOTT.

                         ELIAS
               It's drilled into you, the day
               you're born: "They think you're
               less than, so you've got to be
               better than."

                           BAYARD
               Yes. Yes.

                         ELIAS
               "Everything you do reflects on the
               race." "Be charming, be perfect, be
               polite."

                         BAYARD
               The suffocating chains of Negro
               respectability. When I told Ma
               Rustin I preferred dancing with
               boys instead of girls, she said
               "What would you have me do with
               that?" And then she said "I suppose
               that's what you need to do."

     The sense of intimacy between them is absolute.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               When Martin speaks, he holds
               nothing back. That's what people
               feel when they hear him: truth. So,
               tell me, Elias Taylor, how can you
               preach salvation, and you don't
               want to save yourself? How can you
               speak about love, when your flesh
               is disconnected from your heart?

37                                                             37
     EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT - LATER

     Walking, weaving in and out of shadow and light--
                                                             36.


                         BAYARD
                   (laughing)
               And when Roy said, "So Elias, can
               you substantiate your claim," and
               you pulled out that piece of paper.
               I hope the two of you didn't think--

                         ELIAS
               Teach me how not to be afraid.

     Elias kisses Bayard, gently. When Bayard moves in for more--

                         ELIAS (CONT'D)
               Good night.

     Elias smiles, walks away.

38                                                                38
     INT. WAR RESISTERS LEAGUE / BAYARD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bayard is at his desk, drawing the TWO RECTANGLES, when he
     hears--

                         FEMALE STAFFER (O.S.)
               Lord, no. No!

     Bayard looks up and sees the Staff, gathered around a TV:
     COPS with DOGS and FIRE HOSES attack BLACK CHILDREN/TEENS.

                         MALE STAFF (JIM)
               Shame on Reverend King. He had to
               have known what would happen,
               sending those poor children to
               march the streets of Birmingham.

                         BAYARD
               A man in uniform unleashes attack
               dogs, turns a fire hose on the
               innocent, and the first wo rds out
               of your goddamn mouth are "Shame on
               Reverend King."

                         JIM
               Bayard, I see no reason for you to--

     Trapped inside an anger he can't control--
                                                 37.


                    BAYARD
          You see this and think 'those po'
          Negroes down south,' incapable of
          understanding they are beyond
          powerful, because today they
          discovered a bravery they never
          knew they had, and a bravery you'll
          never know.

Muste enters, undetected.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          You sit behind that desk, as you
          have sat for over thirty years,
          convincing yourself you are
          committed to saving the world, when
          the only thing you're commi tted to
          is your own safety and superiority.

                    MUSTE
          Bayard, enough! Raging against Jim
          because of the color of his skin.

                    BAYARD
          I'm not raging against Jim because
          of the color of his skin. I'm
          raging at him for being arrogant
          and ill-informed. The fact that he
          happens to be white while doing so,
          well that's between him and the
          Lord.

                     MUSTE
          Every day we agree to surrender
          that which makes us different, so
          t hat together we might forge a more
          humane world.

                    BAYARD
          I can't surrender my differences.
          The world won't let me. And even if
          I could, I wouldn't want to. Not
          today.

When Muste sees Bayard grab his coat--

                    MUSTE
          Where are you going? What are you
          doing?

                    BAYARD
          Sarah, Sarah, Agnes, Jim.

When Bayard turns to go--
                                                              38.


                          MUSTE
                You must stay here where I can
                protect you, from the world, and
                from yourself. You are a man of
                exceptional skills and keen
                intellect--
                    (confidentially)
                ...But until you admit to your
                anger at being abandoned by your
                parents, which is why you became a
                homosexual, to hurt them and hurt
                yourself, you will never be fully
                whole, not as a man, and not as a
                person committed to saving the
                world.

                          BAYARD
                Mr. Muste, sir, have you ever been
                to a Negro church?

                          MUSTE
                Innumerable times.

                          BAYARD
                As a Quaker, I'd never seen
                anything like it; the hand-
                clapping, singing, shouting. It
                felt like exalted rage. And so
                instead of staying here and saying
                something I might regret, I'm going
                to leave. And this coming Sunday--

      Bayard stomps/claps in a fit of anger and praise.

                          BAYARD (CONT'D)
                ...I'm going to church!

A39                                                            A39
      EXT. PENN SOUTH - NIGHT

      Push-in on Bayard's apartment.

                          ELLA (O.S.)
                So, this young preacher working for
                Roy--

39                                                              39
      INT. BAYARD'S APT. - LATER THAT EVENING

      Bayard is pouring Ella another large glass of wine, as they
      share a home-cooked meal.
                                      39.


          ELLA
...I hear he's so fine, the Lord
cried when he made him.

          BAYARD
I have no idea to what or to whom
you are referring.

          ELLA
And what happened to whatshisname,
the pale one-- Tom? Is that more
your flavor?

          BAYARD
I am drawn to beauty, black-white-
indeterminate. So long as they're
passionate and smart. Why is
everyone so obsessed with what I am
doing and with whom?

          ELLA
I'm just curious as to why it took
you so long to return my calls?

          BAYARD
Because, my dear Miss Baker, you
casually ask questions which cut to
the core of one's soul.

          ELLA
So, why you aren't you on a bus to
Atlanta tonight?

          BAYARD
I'm not wanted in Atlanta.

          ELLA
A reason that has nothing to do
with pride.

          BAYARD
Because I do not care! Besides, Dr.
King is doing just fine.

          ELLA
Albany, Georgia? You call that
doing just fine?



          BAYARD
    (instantly ir ate)
Who, who tries to integrate an
entire town?
          (MORE)
                                                        40.
                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Your focus must be singular: a
          lunch counter, a bus boycott.
          Thinking he had another Bull Connor
          on his hands. Sheriff Pritchett
          undermined every media-savvy move
          Martin made. As a result, the
          Southern Civil Rights struggle got
          swept off the front pages of The
          New York Times.

                    ELLA
              (with a knowing smile)
          Thought you didn't care?

The PHONE RINGS.

                    BAYARD
          I don't! I of course care about the
          cause-- And some where deep inside,
          Martin-- More so Coretta and the
          kids-- Which is not to say--

                    ELLA
          You're embarrassing yourself.
          Answer the phone.

                    BAYARD
          Yes?
              (to Ella)
          Turn on the TV.

Ella flips his TV on. Seated in the Oval office, Kennedy is
delivering an address (archival):

                    PRESIDENT KENNEDY (ON TV)
          --The fires of frustration and
          discord are burning in every city,
          North and South. Where legal
          remedies are not at ha nd, redress
          is sought in demonstrations and
          protests which create tensions and
          threaten violence and lives. We
          face, therefore, a moral crisis as
          a country and a people. It is a
          time to act--

                    BAYARD
          Words. Nothing but--

                    ELLA
          Shh.
                                                          41.


                    PRESIDENT KENNEDY (ON TV)
          Next week I shall ask the Congress
          of the United States to act to make
          a commitment it has not fully made
          in this century to the proposition
          that race has no place in--

Bayard turns the TV off.

                    ELLA
          On your own, you and Martin are
          fine. Together, you are fire. He
          needs you to help him figure out
          what's next. And you need him to
          nationalize this march. And if you
          dare bring up that damn job as an
          excuse--

                    BAYARD
          This afternoon, I quit, or took a
          leave of absence, or--

                    ELLA
          Good! A shark trapped in a shot
          glass! I never bought for one
          second Powell's lie, but I do
          believe he saw the power you and
          Martin have together, and it
          threatened him; threatens them all.

Leveling her focus, so that Bayard dares not look away.

                    ELLA (CONT'D)
          This country has failed us, over
          and over. Even so, each day, we
          forgive by fighting to make things
          right, yet you can't forgive Martin
          for failing you one time.

Bayard finds himself emotionally overwhelmed.

                    ELLA (CONT'D)
          I tell you, this new generation is
          restless, and angry. Are you going
          to let that anger turn to blood,
          our children's blood, or will you
          harness it, with Martin, for our
          freedom?

So go, go win back your friend.
                                                               42.

40                                                                  40
     EXT. SWEETWATER, TN BUS TERMINAL - DAY

     A LINE OF PEOPLE waiting to board a GREYHOUND BUS. Just as
     BAYARD is about to climb on board--

                                                       FLASHBACK:

41                                                                  41
     INT. BUS TERMINAL / SWEETWATER, TN - DAY (1942)

     WHITE FACES keep turning around in their seats, to gawk and
     scorn. The object of their contempt: BAYARD RUSTIN, early-
     30s, seated, his gaze locked forward. A few rows back, a
     sign: COLORED , indicating a SECTION OF SEATS behind him.

     When a WHITE GIRL, 3, reaches for Bayard--

                         MOTHER
                   (pulling her hand back)
               Don't touch that nigger.

     Two POLICE OFFICERS step onto the Bus.

                         OFFICER
               Git on back now.

                         BAYARD
               I cannot move.

                         BUS DRIVER
               You walked past me and sat there.

                         BAYARD
               If I move, this child will never
               know an injustice is taking place.

     The Two Police Officers begin to hit and shove Bayard.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               I am not resisting. Why are you�

     A CRUSHING BLOW SENDS BAYARD TO THE GROUND, and the two
     Officers DRAG HIM OFF THE BUS.

42                                                                  42
     EXT. SWEETWATER, TN BUS TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER (1942)

     The Cops KICK/BEAT BAYARD SEVERELY. The Mother watching from
     her window is aghast. Bayard lifts his head. As a BILLY CLUB
     comes down hard--

                                                   SMASH BACK TO:
                                                             43.

43                                                             43
     INT. BUS / SWEETWATER, TN BUS TERMINAL - DAY (1963)

     Bayard moves down the aisle, past the White Section. He spies
     a FOLDED NEWSPAPER, and grabs it. The HEADLINE staggers him:
     MEDGAR EVERS SHOT DEAD.

44                                                             44
     EXT. MLK'S ATLANTA HOME - HOURS LATER

     Riddled with apprehension, Bayard finishes his cigarette and
     RINGS THE BELL. The door opens to reveal: CORETTA KING, 36,
     beautiful and warm. They hug.

                          BAYARD
               Coretta.

                         CORETTA
               Bayard, as I live and breathe.
                   (ushering him inside)
               When did you get into town?

45                                                             45
     INT. MLK'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

                         BAYARD
               Within the hour.

                         CORETTA
               You must stay for dinner.

                         BAYARD
               You best ask the maste r of the
               house.

                         CORETTA
               There can't be a master without
               slaves, and in this house there are
               neither.

                         BAYARD
               Show me the little ones at once!

46                                                             46
     INT. MLK'S ATLANTA HOME / KITCHEN - LATER

     With baby BERNICE in his arm, Bayard "helps" in the kitchen
     while playing with YOLANDA, 8, MARTIN III, 6, and DEXTER, 2.

                         BAYARD
               So, Madame Coloratura, Carnegie
               Hall? I know some folks who know
               some folks.
                                                        44.


                    CORETTA
          You haven't been here ten minutes--

                    BAYARD
          Yolanda, Dexter, did you know your
          mama is a great singer?

Bayard gestures for Coretta to start singing. When she scoffs
at the notion--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          I'll go first.

                    CORETTA
          Of course you will.

                    BAYARD (SINGING)
          This little light of mine, I'm
          gonna let it shine.

                    CORETTA/BAYARD
          This little light of mine, I'm
          gonna let it shine.

                     CORETTA
          This little light of mine, I'm
          go nna let it shine. Let it shine,
          let it shine, let it shine!

                    BAYARD
          Everybody now!

                     BAYARD/CORETTA/KIDS
          Jesus is the Light, I'm gonna let
          Him shine!

ON: Martin as he walks through the FRONT DOOR.

                                           IN THE KITCHEN:

The "concert" is in full swing. Bayard

casually acknowledges Martin when he sees him standing in the
doorway, but keeps right on singing.

                     BAYARD/CORETTA/KIDS (CONT'D)
          Jesus is the Light, I'm gonna let
          Him shi ne! Let him shine, let him
          shine--

                    BAYARD
          Fortissimo! That means loud!
                                                             45.


                         BAYARD/CORETTA/KIDS
               Let him shinnne!

47                                                             47
     INT. MLK ATLANTA HOME / LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

     Bayard follows Martin into the room and closes the door. It
     is the first time they have been alone together in three
     years; the energy between them, stilted/awkward. Martin
     gestures. They sit.

                         BAYARD
               So...Brother Medgar.

                         MARTIN
               Unspeakable.

                         BAYARD
               When's the funeral?

                         MARTIN
               Next Wednesday. Corrie and Myrlie
               have been in t ouch. What did you
               make of Kennedy's speech?

                         BAYARD
               Calculated, cautious. Hours later,
               Medgar gets shot.

                         MARTIN
               So, your march. Ambitious.

                         BAYARD
               Unless we demonstrate unity and
               strength, Kennedy will do what
               they've all done before: champion
               legislature destined to be doomed.

                         MARTIN
               A March for jobs doesn't address
               our concerns down here.

                          BAYARD
               Then call it a March for Jobs and
               Freedom. This was not an ea sy
               journey for me, but the promise of
               what this march could become--
                   (with mounting passion)
               ...The monumental impact it could
               have, the lives it could radically
               alter, the dreams, visions and
               unfulfilled aspirations of our
               ancestors at long last realized,
               the, the--
                                                         46.


                    MARTIN
              (laughing)
          The first time we met, I remember
          calling Corrie and saying, "This
          Rustin fellow's a little crazy in
          the head." Only later did I fully
          comprehend 'a little' didn't come
          even close. I've missed you,
          friend.

                    BAYARD
          And I, you.

The awkwardness gives way to two minds working as one.

                    MARTIN
          Come fall, the Dixiecrats will get
          to work gutting Kennedy's bill,
          which leaves us roughly--

                     BAYARD
          ...T wo months to pull off the
          largest peaceful protest ever, and
          absolutely no time for anything
          else.

                     MARTIN
          Such as?

                    BAYARD
          Succumbing to blackmail, innuendo
          and lies, which are sure to follow,
          if and when the march is announced.

                    MARTIN
              (gingerly)
          And what of the things about you
          that are true?

                    BAYARD
          What you see I cannot conceal. But
          I swear to you, there will be no
          new incidents.

The Two Men share a look. Bayard lights a cigarette.

                     BAYARD (CONT'D)
          So...

                    MARTIN
          So...an epic demonstration in the
          nation's capitol, organized in 8 to
          10 weeks, and without the support
          of the NAACP?
                                                                47.


                         BAYARD
               Sounds like a helluva good time.

     Martin laughs. They both do, joyful and free.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               You once said "The time is always
               right to do right."

     They look at each other. After a long, thoughtful beat--

48                                                                48
     INT. ROY'S OFFICE/BAYARD'S APARTMENT

     Roy in HIS OFFICE, is INTERCUT with Bayard in HIS APARTMENT,
     watching MARTIN ON TV. Bayard is beaming. Roy is not.

                          MARTIN (ON TV)
               We are calling for a nonviolent,
               pe aceful March on Washington. We
               intend to go there, not by the
               hundred, or the thousands, but by
               the hundreds of thousands. The time
               is now. We shall be free.

49                                                                49
     INT. NAACP CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT SAME DAY

                         ELIAS (INTO PHONE)
                   (covertly)
               Now that Dr. King has publicly
               endorsed the march--

50                                                                50
     EXT. NAACP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

     Randolph, Bayard, Norm and Tom watch as Roy, moving at a
     brusque pace and followed by a p arade of ASSISTANTS, enters
     the building.

                         ELIAS (O.S.)
               ...Mr. Wilkins can't attack it, so
               he's coming after you.

     Elias follows Roy. He and Bayard share a quick look, which
     Tom catches. Martin approaches.

                         MARTIN
               This should prove interesting.
               Chief, after you.

     As Randolph/Martin enter the building, CLEVE ROBINSON, mid-
     50s, a bear of a man, with a large personality and a Jamaican
     accent, appears.
                                                             48.


                         CLEVE
               Brother Rustin!

                         BAYARD
               Cleve, what are you doing here?

                         CLEVE
               When I heard about Roy and his
               little coup-d'tete-a-tete, I
               decided to show up and provide
               support, moral and--
                   (his fists)
               ...Otherwise.

                         BAYARD
               Norm, Tom, meet the indomitable
               Cleve Robinson, Union Leader of
               District 65.

                         CLEVE
               And newly appointed Chairman of the
               March's Administrative Committee--

     Off of Norm and Tom's look--

                          BAYARD RUSTIN
               And i ts first donor.

     A WHITE COUPLE casually glances in their direction.

                         CLEVE
               Guess they've never seen proud
               Black men before.
                   (calling out to them)
               "Glorious shall be the battle when
               the time comes to fight for our
               people and our race."

                         NORM
                   (sotto voce)
               The man's a human hand grenade.

                         CLEVE
               Black gents and Tom, shall we?

51                                                                51
     INT. NAACP CONFERENCE ROOM

     The Big 6 are seated around the table: Urban League's WHITNEY
     YOUNG, 47; CORE's JIM FARMER, 43; SNCC's JOHN LEWIS, the
     youngest, 23; plus Randolp, Martin and Roy.

     There are a number of ASSISTANTS, as well as Elias, Cleve,
     Norman and Tom. Bayard presides.
                                                       49.


                    BAYARD
          I realize a total budget of 65,000
          dollars might seem like a lot--

                    WHITNEY YOUNG
          Chief, there's a rumor going around
          you intend to hold the march this
          summer.

                    JIM FARMER
          Way too soon!

Others agree. The energy feels mutinous.

                    BAYARD
              (above the fray)
          While the horror of Birmingham is
          still fresh in the nation's mind,
          we must seize the moment and--

                    MARTIN
          Bayard, if I might.

Addressing the room--

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          We all heard the President announce
          on national television he's sending
          a bill to Congress. It is my
          personal estimation, and Chief,
          please feel free to contradict,
          that in order to get this bill past
          the southern segregationist, it
          will take a president with
          intelligence, political savvy and
          passion.

The Entire Room is hanging onto Martin's every word.

                    MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Kennedy has the first two in
          abundance, b ut not the third; not
          when it comes to civil rights. And
          so to make sure he does not relent,
          we must not relent in our
          commitment to this country, and to
          the race. And that is the reason
          for the timely nature of this most
          improbable, yet most essential
          endeavor.

                    RANDOLPH
          I couldn't have said it better
          myself.
                                                             50.


     Seeing the impact Martin just had--

                         ROY WILKINS
               Who are all these people? I did not
               cut short my Regional Conference to
               meet with everybody's seconds the
               thirds.
                   (indicating the Big 6)
               You, you, you, you, and you, stay.
               Everybody, out!

                         CLEVE
               I am Chairman of the Administrative
               Committee, and to date, the march's
               only donor.

                         ROY WILKINS
               Much appreciated. OUT!

                         CLEVE
               Go ahead! Vote yourselves outta
               history!

                         BAY ARD
                   (ushering him out)
               Come along, Cleve.

                         CLEVE
               I'd be happier doin' it without
               you, you showboatin' blood-suckin'
               sons-of-whores.

     Once they are gone: DOOR SLAM.

52                                                             52
     INT. 6TH AVENUE BAR - MINUTES LATER

     Bayard is seated at the bar, Cleve and Norm on either side of
     him, while Tom paces. Bayard is calm. The others are not.

                         CLEVE
                   (annoyed with Bayard)
               Just sitting there, like some toad?

                         NORM HILL
               I am so disappoint ed in Mr.
               Wilkins.

                         TOM
               You do realize what's happening,
               right this second?
                                                   51.


                    BAYARD
          My guess is, Roy is starting to
          build his case against me.


INTERCUT: BAYARD AT THE BAR & THE MEETING ROOM:

Bayard narrates what we see in the meeting room:

                    ROY WILKINS
          We must ask ourselves, is this the
          man we wish to see labeled 'Mr.
          March on Washington.'

                     BAYARD (AT THE BAR)
          John Lewis and the Chief will
          defend me.

                    ROY WILKINS
          He was a member of the Young
          Communist League--

                    RANDOLPH
          Which he renounced years ago.

                    ROY WILKINS
          ...Imprisoned for refusing the
          draft.

                    JOHN LEWIS
          A moral decision, not a cowardly
          one.

                    BAYARD (AT THE BAR)
          Even so, Roy will press on.

                    ROY WI LKINS
          His mannerisms and reputation make
          him an easy target. And when the
          White press and powers that be take
          aim, and they will, every single
          person seated around this table
          will also be in the line of fire,
          because of him.


A DEADLY SILENCE.

                    MARTIN
          Whatever we decide, we must do so
          with humility and respect.

                    JIM FARMER
          Chief?
                                                          52.


     OFF Randolph, carefully considering his next move.

53                                                          53
     INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL / BAR - MINUTES LATER

     Bayard sees Randolph walking toward them.

                         RANDOLPH
               What date is strategically wise for
               a march?

                         BAYARD
               We'll need at least eight weeks.

                         RANDOLPH
               Monday, August 26th?

                         BAYARD
               Mondays will be challenging for
               protestant Ministers, and Fridays
               complicated for our Jewish friends.

                         TOM
               I'm sorry sir, but what happened in
               t here?

                         MR. RANDOLPH
               They voted to remove Bayard as
               Director.

                         CLEVE
               Son-of-a-bitch!

                         RANDOLPH
               And my first order of business was
               to reappoint him as my Deputy
               Director, putting him fully in
               charge.

                         BAYARD
               You can call me Trash Collector for
               all I care. I only wish I could
               have seen Roy's face.

     Indicating Tom's stunned expression--

                          MR. RANDOLPH
               Looked a little like Tom's does
               right now.

                          CLEVE
                   (hugging Bayard)
               You'r e one clever black bastard!
                          (MORE)
                                                              53.
                         CLEVE (CONT'D)
               Can't put a thing over on you. Are
               you sure you're not Jamaican?

     As the sense of celebration/relief continues, Randolph places
     both hands on Bayard's shoulders--

                         RANDOLPH
               Get to work.

54                                                               54
     EXT. 130TH STREET/HARLEM - DAY (1963)

     A residential block. VIBRANT. KIDS PLAY, TEENAGE GIRLS dance

     to TRANSISTOR RADIOS. OLDER MEN PLAY DOMINOES while WOMEN
     GOSSIP and LAUGH. A YOUNG BOY looks up. HIS POV:

     A CARAVAN of P EOPLE as it turns onto 130th Street, with
     Bayard as the Pied Piper, followed by The Team which has
     grown to roughly 19. They are joyful and energized, and carry
     portable typewriters, lamps, fans, office supplies, etc.
     Cleve is part of the procession, as is DR. ANNA ARNOLD
     HEDGEMAN, 64, sophisticated and fierce, and COURTNEY, a
     handsome young recruit.

     The whole street watches as they make their way down the
     block before entering 170 West 130th, a neglected brownstone,
     soon to be known as--

55                                                               55
     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS/2ND FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

     A LARGE OPEN SPACE, a BANK of WINDOWS at the FRONT and BACK.

                         BAYARD
               Our new offices. The third floor is
               uninhabitable, so we'll all be on
               top of each other down here.

                         YVETTE
               Dirty.

                         BAYARD
               Keen observation.
                   (he hands her a broom)
               Over here--

     He flings open a BACK WIN DOW and indicates a COURTYARD below,
     overgrown and littered with junk.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Our boardroom.
                                                           54.


                    CLEVE
              (to Norm)
          Nice.

                    BAYARD
          Rachelle, you'll be in charge of
          transportation.

                    RACHELLE
          For a hundred thousand people? I
          can't even drive.

                    BAYARD
          My faith in you and your compulsive
          nature knows no bounds. Norm,
          you'll travel from city to city,
          raising funds and spreading the
          word.

                    NORM
          What's my budget?

Sticking a $20 bill in his pocket.

                     BAYARD
          This'll get you to your first city,
          where you'll raise enough to g et
          you to the next.
              (Calling out)
          My office!

                    DR. ANNA
          Near the front door. Is that wise?

                    BAYARD
          I'd like to welcome a woman who
          needs no introduction--

Dr. Anna gives Bayard a look. She wants an introduction.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Educator, activist, and the first
          Negro woman to serve in a New York
          City cabinet position, Dr. Hedgeman
          has volunteered to lead outreach to
          all religious organizations.

                    DR. ANNA
          There shall be two lists: one for
          those who support us, and one for
          those who do not. Over time, those
          who are opposed shall be shamed
          into surrender.
                                                           55.


Charlene throws a "I'm-scared-of-her" look.

                     BAYARD
          Tom, Eleanor, you'll oversee all
          written documents. First up, an
          invite to a July 2nd meeting with
          the Big 6.

The room erupts with objections.

                    DR. ANNA
          All those oversized hats to fit
          their oversized heads.

                    BAYARD
          We need their numbers and
          resources. And they are each
          loaning us two employees.

                      CLEVE
          Spies!

                    BAYARD
          If this uneasy alliance is ever
          going to wor k, we've got to figure
          out how to live under one roof.

Going down a line, hurling orders, then moving on before
anyone can object--

                      BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Courtney?

                      COURTNEY
          Yes sir.

The others mock his formality,

                    BAYARD
          You're coming with me to D.C.
              (standing next to Cleve)
          If we expect to engage a hundred
          thousand people, we'll need a phone
          on every desk, and someone to get
          them on the cheap.

                    CLEVE
          Look no further. I'm yo ur man.

                    BAYARD
          Rachelle, two sisters from SNCC
          will be moving in with you sometime
          tomorrow. Tom--
              (confidentially)
                    (MORE)
                                                                56.
                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Instead of finding a place in the
               city, you'll stay in my spare room;
               keep me focused and out of trouble.

                         TOM
               Bayard, we tried this and--

                         BAYARD
               Norm-Tom-Charles, around the
               corner, Johnson's Mortuary. See if
               they'll lend us chairs. Now.
                   (they go)
               By the time I get back tomorrow
               night from D.C., this "dump" needs
               to be operational.

56                                                                56
     EXT. THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL / WASHINGTON D.C.

     A STUNNINGLY CLEAR SKY. Baya rd and Courtney are climbing the


     LINCOLN

     MEMORIAL STEPS when Bayard turns to take in: the REFLECTING
     POOL and the WASHINGTON MONUMENT beyond it.

     REVEAL: CHIEF WELLS and FIVE MEN, all white, standing atop
     the steps. A tiny reception for such a grand idea.

                         BAYARD
                   (warmly smiling)
               One can't help but be in awe.

                         COURTNEY
               Makes you want to believe.

     Chief Wells steps forward, wearing a smile void of warmth.

                         BAYARD
               Bayard Rustin, Deputy Director of
               The March on Washington for Jobs
               and Freedom.

                         CHIEF WELLS
                   (as they shake)
               Chief Wells.

     Rattling off names, without any indication who is whom--

                         CHIEF WELLS (CONT'D)
               Messrs. Caldwell and Murray,
               Deputies Walden, Cowell and Barnes.
                                      57.


          BAYARD
Who's with National Park Service?

           CHIEF WELLS
No one.

          BAYARD
If I'm not mistaken, The Mall falls
under NPS jurisdiction?

           CHIEF WELLS
Correct.

           BAYARD
Chief Wells, in little under seven
weeks' time, a monumental, two-day
event is--

          CHIEF WELLS
One day. It's no longer a two-day
event.

          BAYARD
According to whom?

          CHIEF WELLS
Mr. Wilkins of the NAACP also
believes it should be one day.

          BAYARD
    (the faux-accent is b ack)
It'd be safe in assuming you do not
work for Mr. Wilkins?

          CHIEF WELLS
    (amused)
No, I do not.

          BAYARD
Neither do I, so I'm confused as to
why you mentioned his name. I am
however very interested in knowing
who you do work for, and if they're
the person who also believes the
march should be one day?

          CHIEF WELLS
    (with a smile)
Mr. Rustin, we've found what works
best is for you to answer our
questions, not the reverse.
                                                         58.


                    BAYARD
          And I've found a free flowing
          exchange of information and ideas
          works even better.

                     CHIEF WELLS
          When you put on an event in your
          mall we'll give that a go, but
          seeing as it's your gathering in
          our mall--

                    BAYARD
          Your Mall? Not The National Mall,
          or America's Front Yard, or The
          People's Mall.

                    CHIEF WELLS
          Mr. Rustin, since you insist on
          raising your voice--

         CHIEF WELLS (CONT'D)                BAYARD
...And appear more invested      I haven't raised my voice.
in constructing roadblocks       Courtney, have you heard--
instead of finding solutions,    Roadblocks! The person I need
then I fail to see how we can    to communicate with the most
support in a substantive way,    didn't BOTHER TO SHOW UP!
your gathering. Gentlemen--

As Wells/ The Men descend the Memorial steps--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Where are you going?
              (to Courtney)
          Where are they--

Charging down the steps after them--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Sir, we have yet to discuss bus
          arrivals, drinking fountains...

The Men continue on their way.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
              (calling after them)
          And it is not a gathering! It is an
          act of civil disobedience,
          organized and sanctioned by some of
          the most meaningful minds in the
          country. And it is going to take
          place...

The Men are now too far away to hear--
                                                             59.


                         BAYARD RUSTIN
               ...Over two days.

     Bayard is left standing in the middle of the steps, trying to
     make sense of what just happened.

                         BAYARD (O.S.)
               I tell you Martin--

57                                                             57
     INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - UNION STATION/MARTIN'S STUDY

     Bayard seated in a phone booth, his hand positioned outside
     of the booth doors, smoking, is INTERCUT with Martin at home.

                         BAYARD
               Not since Tennessee, when those two
               policemen set out to reconf igure my
               face, have I experienced such an
               overt display of disregard. They
               had one goal: to make sure the
               meeting was a resounding failure.

                         MARTIN (INTO PHONE)
               You say he mentioned Roy?

                         BAYARD
               Yes, but it was clear this was
               coming from some place higher up.

                         MARTIN
               The President and Attorney General/
               brother Bobby higher up, or Hoover
               and the FBI higher up?

     Looking around before answering--

                          BAYARD
               All of th e above.

     Silence, as both Men realize the weight of Bayard's response.

                         MARTIN
               Corrie's calling me to dinner.
               We'll talk tomorrow.

                         BAYARD
               Give her a hug.

     Bayard hangs up and just sits there.
                                                               60.

58                                                               58
     INT. RACHELLE'S APT. - THAT NIGHT

     Sonic and visual chaos abounds. While Chubby Checker, sans
     sound, dances the twist on TV, and MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS'
     Heatwave blasts on the Hi-fi, Southern sisters JOYCE, 18,
     DORIE, 19, spirited and tough, are in the kitchen serving
     soul food piled high on paper plates, to Tom, Eleanor and
     Rachelle. Bayard, still reeling from his day in D.C., sits in
     a corner, nursing a glass of wine.

                         RACHELLE
               Dorie, Joyce, I swear I have never
               tasted anything this good in my
               entire life. Have you, Tom?

     Tom nods to the beat and keeps chewing. They all LAUGH.

                         ELEANOR
               Wait a minute. You're the one who
               started the riot.

                         DORIE
               Girl, you know how white people
               are. Three Negroes on a corner and
               it's a riot. No offense.

     Rachelle gestures, `none taken.'

     Tom is too busy eating to respon d. When Bayard hears
     LAUGHTER, his sullen mood begins to lift.

                         JOYCE
               After Mr. Evers' funeral, we were
               all standing around, numb, unable
               to move.

                         DORIE
               So I started walking, and folks
               started singing, and the walking
               turned to marching, and singing to
               shouting. And when the police
               showed up and got all white, we got
               real colored real quick!

                         ELEANOR
               For an instant riot, just add
               Dorie.

     The OTHERS laugh/ch eer her on.

                          JOYCE
                   (bringing him a plate)
               Mr. Bayard, you knew our mentor,
               Mr. Evers.
                                                 61.


                    BAYARD
          Call me Bayard. He was a good man,
          and an early supporter of the
          march.

                    TOM
          You're not gonna be with us in
          Harlem?

                    DORIE
          I'll be downtown, at SNCC. But
          Joyce will.

                    BAYARD
              (To the room)
          I have a question.

Rachelle turns down the music.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          What got you each started?

                    JOYCE
          Well--

                    BAYARD
          Don't be nervous.

                    JOYCE
          ...When I was 10, Dorie 11, we were
          at the corner store, when this
          white clerk came up from behi nd and
          grabbed Dorie's breast.

                    DORIE
          So I grabbed a box of donuts, and
          beat him upside his head.

                    JOYCE
          We ran home and told our mama and
          she said, "You shoulda killed him."
          We've been marching ever since.

                    ELEANOR
          For me, it started with our fathers
          fighting Aryan racism in Germany
          and then coming home to Jim Crow
          laws. They started NAACP chapters,
          and we are their children; the
          first generation to grow up knowing
          how to organize and fight back.

                    JOYCE
          Tom?
                                                   62.


                    TOM
          He already knows my story.

                      DORIE
          We don't.

                    TOM
          Shortly after I was born, my mother
          left me at a Foundling Hospital.

                    JOYCE
          Jesus wept.

                    TOM
          I sometimes think my sense of
          social justice was born of being an
          outsider in an adoptive family. I'm
          also here because my father worked
          with the unions, so I'm very
          passionate about building
          coalitions. That's about it.

                     RACHELLE
          The first adults to make me feel
          good a bout myself were my 5th grade
          teacher and 7th grade librarian;
          Negro women who demanded I read
          something other than comic books,
          and let me check out books from the
          grown- up section. And then Emmett
          Till happened.

                    ELEANOR
              (a punch to her stomach)
          Umph!

                    RACHELLE
          And seeing kids my age being spat
          on integrating Central High--

                    DORIE
          Don't get me going.

                    RACHELLE
          ...I joined the Students for
          Democratic Action, and once we got
          to college-- Tom and I went to the
          same high school, we volunteered at
          this office run by Bayard, who
          taught us about The Movement, and
          what books to read. He'd sing and
          he was just so-- Remember, Tom?

Tom nods, moved. Taking in each of their faces--
                                                             63.


                         BAYARD
               After the day I had in D.C., thank
               you.

59                                                             59
     INT. BAYARD'S APT. - LATER

     Bayard is alone. His PHONE RINGS.

                          BAYARD
               Hello?

     FAINT BREATHING. He hangs up. It RINGS AGAIN.

                          BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Hello?

     BREATHING. He hangs up, puts a MAHALIA JACKSON RECORD on the
     Hi-fi. The phone RINGS AGAIN! He turns Mahalia up so loud, he
     can't hear the phone.

     The SOUND of a POUNDING KNOCK startles Bayard. He looks over

     and sees the CHAINED DOOR, PARTLY OPENED. It's Tom.

     Letting him in/turning down the volume--

                          BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Sorry.

                         TOM
               Sorry. Are you alone?

                         BAYARD
               Never when Mahalia is around.
               Drink?

                         TOM
               I should probably...

                         BAYARD
               So, those sisters.

                         TOM
               Such heart.

                         BAYARD
                   (indicating a drink)
               I made you one anyway.

                          TOM
               Bayard--
                                                             64.


                         BAYARD
                   (moving in)
               No one has to know.

                         TOM
               When I was five, my mother told me
               she was taking me back to where she
               62.

                         TOM (CONT'D)
               found me. Along the way, she
               sobered up and we went back home. I
               begged her to tell me what she'd
               meant. She never did. Eight years
               later, I found my adoption papers.
               I hate secrets, and I won't be
               yours.

     Tom goes into his room and closes the door. Just when the
     loneliness is about t o devour Bayard--


     EXT. A SIDE STREET (26TH) -

60                                                               60
     MINUTES LATER

     Bayard, exhausted/restless, is walking down a DARKENED STREET
     when he sees, on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET, A MAN-IN-
     SHADOWS. The cruising begins:

     The Man walks toward Bayard, slows down. Bayard does the
     same. The MAN STOPS. So does Bayard. It's all in BAYARD'S
     FACE: desperation, trepidation, desire. Just when the Man is
     about to cross the street, Bayard's caution/paranoia sets in,
     and he quickly walks away.

61                                                               61
     INT. ELIAS'S ROOM / SRO - LATER

     Bayard sits in a chair, his sleeves rolled up, trying not to
     laugh at Elias, who is mid-sermon and using inflections/
     rhythms which are the antithesis of who he is.

                         ELIAS
               And GAWD will shine his light down
               on you. He will LIFT YOU UP in your
               time of sorrow, for as the good
               book says: SUFFER NOT little
               children, unto me.
                                                                65.


                         BAYARD
                   (laughing)
               I'm sorry, but what the hell was
               that?

     You sound like some 87-years-old, jack-leg preacher from
     Backwoods, Mississippi.

                          ELIAS
                   (hurt)
               I apologize for wasting your time.

                         BAYARD
                   (cornering Elias)
               I wanna see you not your asthmatic
               father-in-law, or whoever the hell
               you think you've got to be to
               appeal to his congregation. 63.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
                   (getting even closer)
               I wanna see your hurt, your heart.
               Martin holds a PhD from Boston
               University. He's impassioned and
               political and a mama's boy, and
               over time he has learned to not
               apologize for any of that!

     With HIS HANDS on ELIAS'S CHEST--

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Try it again, and this time , I
               wanna see you.

     The energy between them emotional/vulnerable/sexually
     charged. And in that moment, Bayard understands: the first
     move, if there is going to be one, must come from Elias.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               That's all for tonight.

     Bayard grabs his coat and goes.

     INT. BAYARD'S OFFICE

     Bayard is listening intently to John Lewi s, the youngest
     member of the Big 6, Southern and full of heart.

                         JOHN LEWIS
               The President kept talking, mostly
               about himself; how if anything goes
               wrong at the march, it's gonna kill
               his bill, and why protest at the
               White House, especially after his
               speech and his bill.

                         BAYARD
               What was Roy's response?

                         JOHN LEWIS
               Nodding mostly.

                         BAYARD
               Whitney and Jim?

                         JOHN LEWIS
               Watching Martin, who was listening.
               And then the President's brother--

                         BAYARD
               The Attorney General was there?

                         JOHN LEWIS
               ...Kept saying we should cancel,
               call the whole thing off. And
               that's when Mr. Randolph stood up
               and said "Mr. President, we are
               going to march on Washington.

                         BAYARD
               And this took place in the Oval
               Office?

     EXT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER

     The overgrown vegetation has been cut back to reveal concrete
     slabs onto which a circle of chairs has been placed. The Big
     6 are all present. Bayard is aggressively doodling. His talk
     with John has left him on edge. Martin and Randolph can sense
     it.



                         RANDOLPH
               Son, how are you?

                            BAYARD
                   (taut)
               Good.

                         JIM FARMER
               Before we begin, I received a very
               distressing letter from Senator
               Douglas:

                         RANDOLPH
               Regarding--

                            JIM FARMER
               Latrines.

                         WHITNEY YOUNG
               I did as well, from Senator
               Humphrey.

     What initially appeared to be doodling is Bayard scribbling
     notes: Contact GUARDIANS/Wire Mahalia/Sound system.

                         ROY WILKINS
               So did I. Senator Hart. Isn't Park
               Services helping out?

                         BAYARD
                   (continuing to scribble)
               No, they are not.
                                                           68.


                     WHITNEY YOUNG
          Bayard, aren't you the least bit
          concerned?

                    BAYARD
          What concerns me, Whitney, is the
          three of you got the exact same
          letter, but instead of looking at
          the President's brother, who likely
          had them sent, you're looking at
          me. The issue of latrines is easily
          solved, if we had money.
              (blunt/direct)
          Each of you committed on behalf of
          your organizations to contribute
          two thousand dollars, but I 've yet
          to see one check.

                    JIM FARMER
          Bayard, we're each dealing with our
          own economic constraints--

                    BAYARD
          Which is why I am proposing-- The
          March should form a coalition with
          the Unions; with the AFL-CIO and
          the UAW--

                    ROY WILKINS
          Both of whom are against a two-day
          event, and measures directed at the

                    BAYARD
              (ignoring Roy)
          Chief, you're on the AFL Council.

                    RANDOLPH
          I'm not sure about Meany, but Mr.
          Reuther at the UAW does in fact
          prefer a one-day march and no White
          House event.

            BAYARD                        ROY WILKINS
   (to Randolph)                   (to the Room)
Put me in a room with Reuther   What did I just say?
and Meany, and I'll convince

What did I--

them to-- (to Bayard) (to Roy) We must limit this to one

No. No. day, and take the White House

     We cannot retreat! off the table!

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               First you tried to get me fired,
               and now you want to see the whole
               march destroyed.

                         WHITNEY YOUNG
               Bayard, let's not point fingers.

                          ROY WILKINS
               Did I wake up one morning and say
               to myself, "Let's stage the largest
               march ever, and get former-
               communist-ex-convict-quaker Bayard
               Rustin to pull it altogether? No, I
               did not! But once we signed on,
               we're in it, no matt er what.
                   (before Bayard interrupts)
               If you would stop being so goddamn
               willful and accept the inevitable
               now, instead of later, when
               economics force you to, it will
               give the appearance of unity and
               strength. It's called being
               strategic.

     The meeting is over. Randolph, Martin, Dr. Anna and Bayard
     are huddled together.

                         RANDOLPH
               I realize this may feel l ike an
               attenuation of everything we fought
               for.

                         BAYARD
               Because that's exactly what it is.
               A two-day event will make it clear
               to Kennedy, Hoover, whomever, we
               will not back down or back away.

                         RANDOLPH
               If you allow Roy this one win--

     Bayard aggressively shakes his head `no.'

                         MARTIN
               Bayard, Bayard-- You have Chief,
               you have me, Dr. Hedgeman, John.

                            BAYARD
                      (calling out)
               Tom?

                            TOM
               Yeah.

                         BAYARD (O.S.)
               On my desk is an Invitation to the
               March, Dr. Anna asked I write for
               Mother AME Zion's Church Bulletin.
               My spelling is atrocious, so check-
               double-check.

     A buoyant Bayard enters, wearing one of his smartest suits.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Also have Office r Johnson of the
               New York Guardians come see me next
               week.
                   (crossing to the Door)
               Oh, and in addition to an FBI
               detail now parked out front,
               careful what you say on the phone,
               as I have a feeling the entire
               Kennedy clan is listening in.

     He is gone.

84                                                               84
     EXT. 8TH AVENUE BAR - LATER

     Bayard is transfixed, unable to move. Across the street--


     GAY BAR PATRONS COWER, REPORTERS' CAMERAS FLASH-FLASH-FLASH!

     The POLIC E CAR'S RED FLASHING LIGHTS. The MEN being loaded in
     a PADDY WAGON.

     The IMAGES trigger something inside of Bayard.

     The back of a BLACK MAN'S HEAD, hit by FLASHING LIGHTS; WHITE
     HANDS jerking a BLACK ARM out of a car, BLACK HANDS
     handcuffed from behind.

                         A MAN'S VOICE
               Mr. Rustin?
                                                             77.


     Bayard jumps/turns around. It's Elias. As the PADDY WAGON
     pulls away--

                           ELIAS
                 I waited for you outside. Once the
                 shutters closed, the cops stormed
                 in, rounded them up like dogs. Why
                 the cameras?

                           BAYARD
                 The police sometimes alert the
                 press when there's going to be a
                 raid.

     Doubling over, dizzy, overwhelmed--

                            ELIAS
                 I have a wife, parents, six
                 brothers and sisters, a
                 congregation in wait. What if I'd
                 gone ins ide? I almost did. WHERE


     WERE YOU?

                           BAYARD
                 Running late, thank God.

                           ELIAS
                 Or God's warning.

                           BAYARD
                 Ma Rustin once told me I should
                 only associate with those who have
                 as much to lose as I do. We'll be
                 more careful. Make wiser choices.

                           ELIAS
                     (turning to go)
                 I have to go. I--

                           BAYARD
                     (calling after him)
                 Elias--

     Elias doesn't stop.

85                                                               85
     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / 2ND FOOR - THAT NEXT DAY

     Bayard and BILL JOHNSON, president of the GUARDIANS, making
     their way through a beehive of office activity.
                                                          78.


                    BAYARD
          Roughly speaking, how many
          Guardians are there?

                     OFFICER BILL JOHNSON
          1,100 Negro New York City
          policemen.

                    BAYARD
          You're the only cops I can trust,
          so I'm going to need every single
          one of you in D.C., but your guns
          must stay home.

                    OFFICER BILL JOHNSON
          Even if I thought it was a good
          idea, which I do not, New York law
          requires we are in possession of
          our fire arms twenty four hours a
          day.

As Johnson goes--

                    BAYARD
          Then I guess we'll have to change
          the law.

Thanks for stopping by. (calling out)

Eleanor, get Mayor Wagner on the phone.

Bayard turns. Everyone is motionless, except for Bayard as he
walks toward a RADIO.

                    STROM THURMOND (ON RADIO)
          --Mr. King's infamous alliances
          with communists and agitators has
          been a carefully guarded secret.
          Until now! Mr. Bayard Rustin is not
          only Mr. King's closest ad visor, he
          is also a draft dodger and a
          communist! That is correct. This
          March is being built by the
          Communist Party itself!

Bayard turns off the radio and SWITCHES INTO HIGH GEAR.

                    BAYARD
          Tom, we need three press releases,
          ranging from purely pissed to
          questioning the mental well-being
          of the not-so-beloved Senator from
          South Carolina.
                                                             79.


     The PHONES START RINGING.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Eleanor, what's the name of the
               woman reporter from The Washington
               Post? McNair, McNeal--

                         ELEANOR
               Susanna McBee?

                         JOYCE
                   (holding a phone)
               Bayard, Dr. King.

                         BAYARD
                   (crossing to his office)
               I will not speak to any other
               press, except her. And get Mayor
               Wagner to call me back.

     He goes inside and CLOSES THE DOOR.

86                                                             86
     INT. BAYARD'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

     Bayard listens.

                         MARTIN (ON PHON E)
               Fortunately, Roy's animus towards
               you is eclipsed by his
               unadulterated hatred for Strom
               Thurmond, so we're safe for now.

                         BAYARD
               Thank you friend.

     Bayard hangs up. Now that he's alone, his mask of authority
     gives way to vulnerability and concern. A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
     saves him from sinking any further.

                         TOM
                   (entering)
               Here's purely pissed. Was easy to
               write.

                         BAYARD
               When I went to see Martin in
               Atlanta, I a ssured him there would
               be no incidents.

                         TOM
               It's not your fault. Someone needs
               to go dredging up Strom Thurmond's
               past. No telling what we'd find.
                                                              80.


     Bayard gestures for Tom to sit.

                         BAYARD
               Years ago, I traveled the country
               giving speeches for The Fellowship
               of Reconciliation. This one time...

     A QUICK KNOCK, followed by Elias poking his head into the
     room.

                         ELIAS
                   (beaming)
               Is this the office of the famous
               Bayard Rustin?

                         TOM
               I'll finish the other two.

     Tom leaves. Elias closes the door.

                         ELIAS
               That racist piece of white trash
               calls any famous Negro a communist .
               It's a badge of honor.

                         BAYARD
               That and fame, I'd just as soon do
               without.

                         ELIAS
               Too late for that.
                   (moving in)
               I've been thinking a lot--

                         BAYARD
               About?

                         ELIAS
               What Ma Rustin said: Only associate
               with someone with as much to lose.

                         BAYARD
               And just who might that someone be?

                         ELIAS
               Who do you think?

87                                                               87
     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS - DAYS LATER - NIGHT

     A late-night Meeting is underway. Desks have been pushed
     together to f orm a large table. The Team listens as ELEANOR
     reads from The WASHINGTON POST.
                                                        81.


                    ELEANOR
          "Devoted to non-violence, Mr.
          Rustin claims: 'friendliness, not a
          gun, is the proper weapon.'" She
          goes on to mention your dedication
          to justice and peace, and calls you
          heroic.

The Team CHEERS/BANGS ON DESKS/WHISTLES.

                    BAYARD
          Enough, enough. Get rid of all of
          that. So last night, thinking about
          the march--

                    CHARLENE
          Run for cover.

Everybody laughs.

                    BAYARD
          We need to provide toll booths with
          leaflets so that those arriving by
          cars know where to go once in D.C.
          Courtney, take charge, and Charlene
          would be glad to assist.

Everybody chides Charlene.

                    CHARLENE
          I was gonna volunteer anyway.

                    BAYARD
          It's just after 1. Early. Good
          night everyone.

As everyone packs up to go, BLYDEN, last seen threatening to
kick Tom's ass, appears at the top of the stair. Before Tom
can respond, Blyden wraps him in a hug.

                    BLY DEN
          My brother, long time no see. White

                    TOM
          Blyden, what are you doing here?

                    BAYARD
          Blyden!

                    BLYDEN
              (joining him)
          Mr. Rustin, suh!
                                                             82.


                         BAYARD
               Bayard will suffice. I've been
               hounding the Mayor about a project.
               Today, he called back and said yes.
               So, starting next week--

88                                                             88
     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / 2ND FLOOR

     Outside, it's raining. 25 Guardians look to Officer Johnson,
     who reluctantly nods. A COAT RACK is soon loaded down with


     HOLSTERS/GUNS.

89                                                             89
     EXT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS

     It's RAINING HARD, the Courtyard is flooded.

90                                                             90
     MARCH HEADQUARTERS - 3RD FLO OR - MOMENTS LATER

     LADDERS/TARP/BROKEN FURNITURE/etc. have been pushed to the
     side. Pots capture DRIPPING WATER as the RAIN CONTINUES TO
     POUR. Elias eases into the room and watches as the GUARDIANS
     STAND MOTIONLESS, while Blyden tears into them, one after
     another.

                         BLYDEN
               I do not take orders from no
               muthafuckin' Uncle Toms. Thinkin'
               you shit, 'cause of that badge.

     Blyden is "performing rage." For th e Guardians, it's real.
     And because they aren't allowed to defend themselves/attack,
     their emotions are coming to the surface.

                          BAYARD
                   (even-toned)
               Form a circle. Your backs to the
               aggressor.

     As they move in--

                         BLYDEN
               How many niggas dead because of
               that badge!

     When an ANGRY GUARDIAN abruptly turns, ready to attack, the
                                                               83.


     SCENE INSTANTLY TURNS - MOS

                                                      A SERIES OF
                                                          IMAGES:

     BLYDEN SPEWING INVECTIVES; JOHNSON glares at BLYDEN, then
     BAYARD. BAYARD coaching the ANGRY GUARDIAN who is about to
     emotionally detonate.

     As BLYDEN CONTINUES TO RAGE, the GUARDIANS BACK HIM INTO A
     CORNER. They are starting to feel the power of working and
     moving as one. Elias is mesmerized. Officer Johnson, though
     still wary, seems convinced enough. EN D MOS.

     Bayard speaks to the Men in a calm, reassuring voice.

                         BAYARD
               You will leave your weapons at
               home. You will wear white
               identifying arm bands, a white hat
               and carry a whistle. It is your
               responsibility to create an
               atmosphere of peace for all to
               witness and follow. God bless you.

     Officer Johnson congratulates the Guardians. Blyden shakes
     the MEN'S HANDS. One of the GUARDIANS playfully puts Blyden
     in a head lock.

                         ELIAS
               That was nothing short of heroic.
               You weaving your spell, watching
               Officer Johnson's respect for you
               grow.

                          BAYARD
               Come on.

     Bayard introduces Elias to Johnson/The Guardians. Tom, who's
     been watching from the doorway the entire time, feels
     disregarded and hurt. An outsider.

91                                                                  91
     INT. BAYARD'S APT. - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Elias moves about the place, checking out BAYARD'S ARTIFACTS/
     OBJECTS, before turning his attention to Bayard's record
     collection. Bayard is in the Kitchen. (OS)

                         ELIAS
               Half of this music I've never even--

     Pulling out an ALBUM, YOUNG BAYARD'S FACE on the cover.
                                                         84.


                    ELIAS (CONT'D)
          "Elizabethan Songs and Negro
          Spirituals." So you sing?

                    BAYARD
              (entering with drinks)
          And on two songs, play the lute.

They wind up seated next to each other.

                    ELIAS
          They sure as hell don't grow 'em
          like you down in Alabama.

                    BAYARD
          Or much to my dismay, anywhere
          else.

Elias sees a LUTE, offers it to Bayard.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          God, no. I haven't played that
          thing since-last week.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
              (singing)
          I n'er didst dream, e'vr the day
          Such heavenly joy wouldst...

They ki ss, gentle and romantic. Just as it's starting to grow
in intensity and desire, the FRONT DOOR OPENS revealing--

                       BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Tom!

Elias leaps up like a little boy that's been caught.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Tom is staying here through the
          march. I thought you and Eleanor--

          Cancelled.

                    BAYARD
          I'm sure you must be--

                    TOM
          I'm good.
              (sitting/marking
               territory)
          So Elias, I hear you're married?
                                                        85.


                    BAYARD
          Tom...

                    ELIAS
          And you attend Howard University.
          I've heard of Colored passing for
          white. Good luck with the reverse.

                    TOM
          When I was sixteen, I brought a
          Negro friend home for dinner. My
          father told me he was not gonna
          allow 'that boy' to sit at his
          table. And that was the end of
          that.

                    ELIAS
          Your friend.

                    TOM
          My family. I moved out and have
          been on my own ever since.

                    ELIAS
          Where I come from, we hold onto our
          family, and they hold onto us, no
          matter what.

Elias looks at Bayard, then goes. Bayard is silent, furious.

                    BAYARD
          I cared about him.

                    TOM
          Who don't you 'care about'? I'm
          sure there's some PhD student at
          Columbia, or junior activist fresh
          out of Fisk. Why don't you take 'em
          to that bar down on 8th Avenue and
          regale them with tales about Gandhi
          and King. And then when it's
          convenient, or when their feelings
          become inconvenient to your need to
          save the race, it's on to the next
          one.

Tom's bravura starts to give way to hurt.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Except this time, you actually
          started giving your heart to
          someone, who is clearly incapable
          of giving his back.

     As Tom charges into his room--

     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / 3RD FLOOR

     Bayard aggressively shoves two tables together.

                         BAYARD
               Courtney, Eugene, more chairs. I
               want the entire Team up here.

     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / 2ND FLOOR

     King, Whitney have just arrived.

                         WHITNEY YOUNG
               We're meeting on--

                         JOYCE
               Yes sir, the 3rd floo r.

94                                                              94

                   (to Bayard)
               Roy's guest just arrived.

                         JIM
               But it's so nice outside.

                         BAYARD
               I hadn't noticed.

     Martin/Bayard look out a FRONT WINDOW: POWELL, stylishly
     attired, is standing by a SLEEK SPORTS CAR, warmly greeting
     his adoring HARLEM CONSTITUENTS. As he and Roy shake hands--

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               Wonder what they're up to?

                         MARTIN
               We're about to find out.

     The Team is starting to arrive o n the 3rd floor.
                                                              87.


                         BAYARD
               Dr. Anna. If there any thoughts
               which have been weighing heavily on
               your heart--

                         DR. ANNA
               Careful. Once the panther's been
               unleashed...

95                                                              95
     INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / 3RD FLOOR - LATER

     The windows are open, which only serves to make the room even
     hotter. Whitney, Jim, Randolph, John, Martin, Bayard, Roy,
     Powell and Dr. Anna sit in a circle.

     They are surrounded by The Team, who sit on the floor, in
     w indowsills, lean against walls. Elias sits off to one side.

                         BAYARD
               And with our three new religious
               leaders, and Mr. Reuther from the
               UAW, the Big 6 has turned into the
               Big 10!

     Applause/Congratulations/Etc.

                         WHITNEY YOUNG
               It's very warm in here.

                         ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
               Hot as hell.
                   (indicating The Team)
               If there were less of 'them.'

     Joyce's hand shoots up.

                         BAYARD
               Yes, Joyce?

                         JOYCE
               My sister and I have been marching
               since we were 11 and 12. So, with
               all due respect, sir, we are
               nobody's 'them.'

                         DR. ANNA
               Perhaps if those sitting in the
               windows moved, there's a slight
               chance a breeze might find its way
               inside.
                                                        88.


                       RANDOLPH
             Given this will probably be one of
             our final meetings before the
             March, Bayard--

                       ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
             Mr. Randolph, I have a question for
             our Deputy Director.

                       RANDOLPH
             I repeat, given this will be one of
             the last times--

Bayard gestures to Randolph, it's okay. Now that Adam has
been given the floor, HE TAKES IT.

                       ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
             Mr. Rustin, you love your work,
             love this March?

                       BAYARD
             With all my heart.

                        ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
             What if, strictly hypothetical,
             there was someone attached to this
             fine organization you've created,
             whose mere presence was detrimental
             to the cause you love; someone
             whose past affiliations, political
             and otherwise, combined with their
             quiddity and flair, could be used
             by those in power to inflict great
             harm, not just to the March, but
             their acts of vengeance could
             easil y derail the fight for racial
             justice, a good ten, fifteen years,
             would you keep them in their
             position, or would your sense of
             duty as a custodian of the cause
             compel you to send him/her, her/
             him, on their way?

                       BAYARD
             Hypothetically speaking?

Adam nods.

                       BAYARD (CONT'D)
             I'd send them on their way. Unless
             the person in question was me.

When Bayard slyly smiles, everyone in the room, except Adam
and Roy, smile/ break into laughter.
                                       89.


          BAYARD (CONT'D)
Julia and Janifer Rustin raised me
to be humble and never brag. But
seeing as no one on The Team was--

          BAYARD (CONT'D)
Blyden, are you a Quaker?

           BLYDEN
Hell no!

          BAYARD
...They'll speak instead. Norm, how
many First Aid Stations have been
secured?

          NORM
22, run by teams of mostly Negro
medical practitioners.

           BAYARD
Water.

          TOM
There will be six water tanks,
1,500 gallons each, insuring that
the 27 portable founta ins are
operational all day long.

          BAYARD
Transportation.

          RACHELLE
All in all, we have 2,220 chartered
buses. CORE North Carolina, 11
buses, SNCC Mississippi, 7.

          BAYARD
And Reverend Powell's church?

          RACHELLE
They've chartered 5. I could
continue, state by state, but Joyce-
-

          JOYCE
We have 40 Freedom trains, and
thanks to the UAW, 6 chartered
flights, bringing workers from
Chicago, Grand Rapids, Flint, 86A.

          JOY CE (CONT'D)
Detroit, Rochester, Syracuse and
New York.
                                                          90.


                    RACHELLE
          Also, per Mr. Rustin's request, the
          Mayor approved the implementation
          of the subway rush hour schedule at
          5 a.m., so that passengers can make
          their 6 a.m. bus departures the day
          of.

                    BAYARD
          Blyden, who are The Guardians?

                    BLYDEN
          A fraternal order of NYC's Black
          police.

                    BAYARD
          And how many will be in Washington
          D.C. to ensure a safe and peaceful
          march.

                    BLYDEN
          Over a thousand.

                      BAYARD
          Latrines?

                      COURTNEY
          EL EANOR

And if I might add, a chartered

plane of celebrities, including--

As Eleanor rattles off names, the Room "oohs and ahhs."

                    ELEANOR
          Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando,
          James Baldwin, Charlton Heston--

                      JIM FARMER
          Moses.

                    ELEANOR
          Diahann Carroll, Sammy Davis Jr.
          Lena Horne, Burt Lancaster, will
          also be in attendance.

                    BAYARD
          All of which has been achieved in
          seven weeks. And that is why I
          would never send me on my way,
          hypothetical or otherwise.
                                                        91.


                    JOHN LEWIS
          Check and mate.

The entire room erupts into applause. Even Roy is silently
impressed.

                    WHITNEY YOUNG
          How did so much get accomplished in
          such a short amount of time.

                    CHARLENE
          By working 12 to 15 hours a day,
          every day, and also because of Mr.
          Bayard, who--

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          Chief, Dr. Hedgeman, have you ever
          gotten a word stuck in your head
          that you just can't shake?

                     MARTIN
              (to Randolph)
          Now what ?

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          While Bayard and the Rustinetts
          were putting on a show, the one
          word I couldn't shake: Pasadena.

On hearing "Pasadena," Bayard doesn't move, his expression
doesn't change. He's physically still present, but HIS SOUL
HAS TAKEN FLIGHT.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL (CONT'D)
          Martin, ever been?

                    MARTIN
          What does this have to do with--

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          How about you, Deputy Director?
          Ever spent time in Pa sadena?

When Bayard doesn't respond, Dr. Anna sees something in
Bayard's eyes she's never seen before, and neither have we:


FEAR.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          Can't recall? Well, I just so
          happen to have-- Where the hell did
          the G.D. thing go? I had it--
                                                        92.


                    DR. ANNA
          I am done. Done. I look at this
          program, and I do not see one
          woman's name. Not Ella Baker, or
          Diane Nash. Not Dorothy Height,
          Gloria Richardson, Prince Lee,
          Myrlie Evers, Rosa Parks or Daisy
          Bates. Not-not-not-not-not. Jim?

                    JIM FARMER
          Well, umm, Roy-Martin-Bayard,
          correct me if I'm wrong, but a
          decision was made early on, that
          only leaders of the participating
          organizations would be allowed to
          speak.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          Hold up! Where's my name?

                    MARTIN
          That also means no politicians.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          I am more than just a politician.
          Stop any man-woman-child on 7th Ave
          and 125th, and say the name Adam
          Clayton Powell--

                    DR. ANNA
          Congressman Powell, I am not done.

                    RANDOLPH
          Dr. Hedgeman, might I suggest we
          address the issue internally, and
          reconvene once a solution has been
          found.

Anna respects Randolph too much to defy him, so she agrees.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
          Back to the point I was about to
          make.

                    ADAM CLAYTON POWELL (CONT'D)
          Son-of-a-bitch. I had the goddamn
          piece of paper - (to Dorie /
          Charlene) Darlin', would one of you
          mind checking the glove compartment-

                    MARTIN
          Adam, you are a guest here.

          You cannot continually-

                                                             93.
                         MARTIN (CONT'D)

               ADAM!

                         ADAM CLAYTON POWELL
               You may be Head-Nigger-Down-South--

                          RANDOLPH
               Congressman Powell! WE. HAVE.
               MOVED. ON.

     The room is stunned. No one has ever seen Randolph erupt.
     Even Adam is stunned. After a beat--

                         RANDOLPH (CONT'D)
                   (gentlemanly)
               Bayard, the floor is yours.

                         BAYARD
                   (cheerfully)
               I'm good.

                         RANDOLPH
               Meeting adjourned!

     Shamed, but worse of all upstaged, Powell hurriedly slips
     out. Relieved it's over, Bayard throws a quick nod to Dr.
     Anna, Martin and The Team. When Bayard looks to Elias for
     comfort/reassurance, Elias does not respond.

     INT. BAYARD'S APT. / CLAUDIA'S HOME - PAST MIDNIGHT

     Bayard in bed scribbling notes is INTERCUT with Claudia,
     sitting alone in a darkened room, lit by a lone floor lamp.
     The phone rings.

                         BAYARD

               Yes. Yes. How are you?
                                                             94.


                         CLAUDIA
               Thank you for asking. I have good
               news: My father has decided to
               officially turn his congregation
               over to my husband.

                         BAYARD
               That is--wonderful indeed.

                         CLAUDIA
               I'm so glad to hear you feel that
               way. So, if you wouldn't mind
               telling my husband it is time for
               him to return home, to the path our
               Lord ordains.

                         BAYARD
               Mrs. Taylor--

                         CLAUDIA
               I'd like to thank you for the time,
               the inordinate amount of ti me
               you've taken with Elias. But that
               is over.

                            BAYARD
               Claudia--

                         CLAUDIA
               You believe in Elias'
               possibilities. I know his
               limitations. Goodbye.

     The line goes dead.

97                                                               97
     EXT. PENN SOUTH - THE NEXT MORNING

     A haggard Bayard rushes out. Charlene and Rachelle scurry
     behind him.

                         BAYARD
               I didn't eat, couldn't sleep.
               Where's Courtney?

                         RACHELLE
               He left an hour ago.

                         BAYARD
               I'm going to miss my flight.

                            CHARLENE
               Rachelle--
                                                                95.


                         RACHELLE
               Time to go be a white girl.

     Rachelle quickly hails a cab and gets in. On her signal,
     Bayard runs and gets in the Taxi. Rachelle gets out.

                         CAB DRIVER
               No. No. OUT!

     The Cabbie reaches back and USES HIS ARM to block Bayard from
     closing the door. Spotting the DRIVER'S HAND in the rolled
     down window, Bayard quickly ROLLS IT UP, trapping the


     DRIVER'S FINGERS.

                         CAB DRIVER
               Roll it down! Roll it down!

     Charl ene and Rachelle are in shock.

                         BAYARD
               Non-violence is a noble calling;
               one we aspire to, but sometimes
               fail.
                   (to the Driver)
               Idlewild Airport, please. Handsome
               tip included.

98                                                                98
     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. / LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY

     At the top of the stairs, Bayard and Courtney look down and
     see Chief Wells and what appears to be a BATTALION of
     DEPARTMENT HEADS, all-white, walking toward them.

                         BAYARD
               Chief Wells.

                         CHI EF WELLS
               Mr. Rustin.

     As Norm passes out maps.

                         BAYARD
               Gentlemen, my associate is handing
               out a map which details the
               locations of key support systems:
               water fountains, First Aid
               stations, Lost & Found. I am also
               pleased to report that over one
               thousand New York City Marshals
               will be present.
                         (MORE)
                                                          96.
                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          The Guardians have been schooled in
          the tenants and practices of
          passive resistance, and will
          therefore not be armed.

                    CHIEF WELLS
          That's not possible.

                    CHIEF WELLS (CONT'D)
          Mr. Rustin, for the first time
          since Prohibition, every liquor
          store in the metropolitan area will
          be closed for the day. All elective
          surgeries have been cancelled, and
          congressmen have told their female
          staff to stay home.

                     BAYARD
          And why i s that? Chief Wells?

Bayard looks to Chief Wells. He is silent.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          Is it because a number of people,
          specifically, a number of men with
          skin similar to my own will be in
          town?

Bayard looks to The Men. Some look away, others blankly
stare.

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          The last time I turned on the
          television, I saw a pack of white
          hooligans assaulting Negroes at a
          lunch counter, and a white police
          officer ordering child ren be hosed.
          But to blame all for the actions of
          a few would be unfair. As a matter
          of fact--
              (a helpful hint)
          ...That is what's called being
          racist.

Singling out TWO ODD-LOOKING MEN--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          You two. Something tells me you
          might be the Engineers I requested.

                    ENGINEER ONE
          That we are.
                                                              97.


                         CHIEF WELLS
                   (to Bayard)
               The day of your march, the entire
               D.C. police force has been
               mobilized, along with 500 reserves,
               2,500 National Guards, 4,000 Army
               soldiers and per orders of The
               Pentagon, 19,000 troops.

                         BAYARD
               I hope you'll have something for
               them to do, as they won't be needed
               here.
                   (to the Men)
               And whoever amongst you has direct
               dealings with Mr. Hoover--
                   (To Wells)
               Chief Wells, you strike me as the
               sort who stands outside of the
               door, never in the room.
                   (to The Men)
               ...Let him know that on August
               28th, black, white, young, old,
               rich, working class, poor will
               descend on Washington D.C., and
               there is nothing he can do to stop
               it. Seeing as he's listening in on
               all my calls anyway, I'll tell him
               myself.

     As Bayard and Company descend the Memorial steps, ONE OF THE
     MEN steps forward and eyes hi m as he goes.

                         BAYARD (CONT'D)
               I need a sound system which allows
               someone speaking or singing here,
               to be heard all the way back there.

                         ENGINEER ONE
               No such system exists.

                         BAYARD
               Then you must invent one, because
               sound is how we turn a crowd into
               an audience.

99                                                              99
     EXT. MARCH HQ / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

     DR. ANNA'S FACE IS STOIC. Roy, Whitney, Randolph, John,
     Cleveland, Eleanor, Rachelle and Tom watch as Jim speaks.
     Eli as, who is also present, looks uncharacteristically tired
     and rough.
                                                         98.


Please Note: The Courtyard is now perfectly groomed.

                     JIM FARMER
          And as each of our accomplished
          heroines rises, Chief would
          proclaim their remarkable deeds to
          the world.

                    DR. ANNA
          So seen, but not heard?

Jim looks to Roy, who looks the other way.

                    JIM FARMER
          They each could write their own
          introduction. And, and we have
          asked Dorothy Height, president of
          the National Council of--

                    DR. ANNA
          I know Mrs. Height.

                    JIM FARMER
          ...To join the Big 6.

                     DR. ANNA
          With all due respect, Mr. Randolph,
          a woman should introduce them, and
          do not ask for recommendations as a
          number of women have informed me
          they will not be participating in
          the march.

                    RANDOLPH
          That is unfortunate to hear.

                    DR. ANNA
          What is unfortunate, sir, are the
          circumstances which led to their
          decision.

Bayard rushes in with a travel bag, Courtney follows. Roy ,
eager to discuss anything other than women--

                    ROY WILKINS
          Bayard! Perfect timing! There's a
          chair right next to me. Sit!

                    WHITNEY YOUNG
          What's the word from Washington?
                                      99.


          BAYARD
We need 16 to 20 thousand dollars
for a sound system, and no, we do
not have it, and yes, Jim, it's a
disaster. But it will be solved.

          CLEVE
Big problem. The official March on
Washington button: white hand on
left, black hand on right. This
one, the reverse. Someone is
selling counterfeit buttons and
robbing us blind.

          BAYARD
I'll handle it.

             CLEVE
How?

          BAYARD
I'll have The Guardians beat 'em to
a pul p.

             CLEVE
Good!

          JOHN LEWIS
Bayard, how are the numbers?

             BAYARD
Rachelle--

          RACHELLE
Our latest estimate: 88,000.

          JIM FARMER
If we have one person less than
100,000--

          ROY WILKINS
Interesting enough, the last couple
of days Congressman Powell has been
hounding me, demanding he speak at
the March. Do you want to know why?
    (relishing the attention)
Aunt Bess is throwing a cookout--

             RANDOLPH
Aunt Bess?

           WHITNEY YOUNG
Nobo dy has an Auntie named Bess.
Aunt Wilhelmina, Aunt Frankie--
                                                  100.


                       ROY WILKINS
            I have an Aunt Bess, and 20 guests
            have been confirmed. How many
            should she cook for?
                 (zeroing in on--)
            Tom?

                      TOM
            19, 20.

All the Black People laugh/mock Tom.

                      ROY WILKINS
            By the time cousins invite cousins,
            and neighbors hear from neighbors,
            Aunt Bess best be cooking for at
            least 50. Adam smells success!

                      CLEVE
            He sure as hell ain't smelling
            ribs, cause with a name like Aunt
            Bess, you know she can't cook!


LAUGHTER.

                       ROY WILKINS
            Mr . Deputy Director, you best be
            cooking for 200,000. You heard it
            here first!

Above the euphoric response--

                      JIM FARMER
            I don't see the March demands in
            the program. They should be heard.

                      JOHN LEWIS
            Bayard, you should read them.

                      BAYARD
            Fifteen days from now, if
            everything goes as planned, you can
            list me as Trash Collector. Chief,
            this has been your dream for many
            years. I nominate Asa Philip
            Randolph!

                      ENT IRE ROOM
            Second!

                      RANDOLPH
            Gentlemen, ladies. Thank you. Thank
            you all.
                                                              101.


                          BAYARD
                Now, unless there is anything else--

      Holding up a SMALL ENVELOPE--

                          WHITNEY YOUNG
                Pledge Cards? Feels a bit off-
                putting, begging the day of?

                          JOHN LEWIS
                    (reading the pledge)
                "I do solemnly swear to commit
                myself to the civil-rights
                struggle, and do pledge my heart,
                mind and body unequivocally and
                without regard to personal
                sacrifice, to the achievement of
                social peace through social
                justice."

      Silenc e. Everyone around the table, including Roy, smile/nod
      their approval. Except Elias.

100                                                             100
      EXT. MT. MORRIS PARK - LATER

      Bayard and Elias are seated on a bench.

                          ELIAS
                My wife-- Her father is retiring
                and is passing his church on to me.

                          BAYARD
                She called to tell me.

                          ELIAS
                Did she also tell you she is
                pregnant?

                          BAYARD
                Elias, you may think you are
                killing off one aspect of yourself,
                but you're not. You're killing all
                of yourself.

      As if performing for someone else--

                          ELIAS
                I am a married man, about to be a
                father, and you, sir, are a sick
                man. You need to stop following me.

      A woeful laugh gurgles out of Bayard.
                                                               102.


                          BAYARD
                She also implied she hadn't heard
                from you. Have you visited this
                park at night?

      Mount Morris baths? Who got to you?

      The Vice Squad? The FBI?

      Do they have pictures?

                          ELIAS
                'For the desires of the flesh are
                against the spirit, and the desire
                of the spirit are against the
                flesh. For these are opposed to
                each other...

                          BAYARD
                To keep you from doing that which
                you most desire.'

      Bayard touches Elias. Elias closes his eyes and, just as he
      is starting to surrender to Bayard's touch, abruptly stands
      and walks away.

101                                                               101
      INT. MARCH HEADQUARTERS / HARLEM - LATER

      Devastated, Bayard is headed up the stairs when he is hit by
      SILENCE.

      At the top of the stairs, not a single person on the 2ND
      FLOOR is moving. And then he hears--

                          STROM THURMOND (ON RADIO)
                --the organizer of this catastrophe-
                in- wait, the so-called "ma n,"

                Rustin, is not only a draft-dodging
                communist, he is also a pervert! I
                have in my possession his Pasadena
                arrest record, dated January 23,
                1953!

      On hearing the word "Pasadena," members of the Team sneak
      looks to Bayard/each other.
                                                         103.


                    STROM THURMOND (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
          Mr. Rustin was arrested, jailed,
          and pled guilty to lewd conduct
          with two men. He is a convicted
          homosexual!

Bayard bum-rushes the radio, turns it off, and tries putting
on a show of 'business as usual.'

          The Council of Churches has

                     RACHELLE
          Yes.

                    BAYARD
          Yes. Peanut butter and jelly,

                    RACHELLE
          We were talking--

The PHONE STARTS TO RING.

                    BAYARD
          Don't answer that. Who's we?

                    RACHELLE
          The girls and myself, and decided
          cheese sandwi ches would be so much
          better.

Another PHONE STARTS RINGING.

                    BAYARD
          No. Peanut butter and jelly.

ANOTHER PHONE RINGS, and ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. When a member
of the team makes a move to answer--

                    BAYARD (CONT'D)
          DON'T. What is the one word you've
          heard me say over and over?

      IMAGES FLASH: YOUNG BAYARD'S FACE being hit, first by the
      LIGHT OF A FLASHLIGHT, and then by the FLASHLIGHT itself.

      When Bayard sees the FACES of THE TEAM, their hurt and
      confusion, it's too much for him to bear. He starts walking,
      then RUNS FOR THE STAIRS.

      Bayard on the roof, PACING/WALKING IN CIRCLES, humiliated,
      angry, trapped. But no matter how aggressively he moves, the
      IMAGES and WORDS do not abate.

      Young Bayard looks up, his face badly bruised.

                GUILTY.

                            TOM (O.S.)
                Bayard...

      Bayard turns. Tom is on the roof. Bayard wants to tell him to
      leave, but doesn't.

                          BAYARD
                Two men. I'd seen them earlier. I

                For the first time ever, I felt
                ashamed of who I was--

      As the CAMERA GOES FLASH.

                And no matter how hard I fight and
                flaunt and believe, it's still
                there. And in rooms where no one
                looks like me, or behaves like me,
                I distract myself by being defiant.
                All the while, inside is the fear
                and shame I keep hidden, even from
                myself. And now that everyone
                knows.

      This stops Bayard cold.

      INT. NAACP CONFERENCE ROOM

      Bayard opens the DOOR. They're all there: Martin, John,
      Whitney, Roy and Jim, all staring at him. But Bayard doesn't
      give them the satisfaction of looking back.

                          BAYARD
                Martin. Alone.

      Martin leads the way. Bayard follows.

      INT. NAACP - SMALL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Martin starts to speak. Bayard stops him with a gesture.

                          BAYARD
                You are one of the smartest men I
                know, so explain to me why, with
                all that is left undone, do I find
                myself forced to yet again justify
                my existence. Each of us has been
                taught, in ways both cunning and
                cruel, that we are inadequate,
                incomplete. And the easiest way to
                combat the feeling of not being
                enough, is to find someone we
                consider less than. Less than
                because they are poorer than us, or
                darker than us, or desire someone
                who our church and our laws say
                they should not desire. And when we
                tell ourselves such lies, st art to
                live and believe such lies, we do
                the work of the oppressors by
                oppressing ourselves. Strom
                Thurmond and Hoover don't give a
                shit about me. What they really
                want to destroy is all of us coming
                together and demanding this country
                change. Are they expecting my
                resignation?

                            MARTIN
                Some are.

                          BAYARD
                Then they're going to have to fire
                me, because I will not resign. On
                the day that I was born black, I
                was also born a homosexual. They
                either believe in freedom and
                justice for all, or they do not.
                                                                107.

      CLOSES THE DOOR.

      INT. MARCH OFFICE / 2ND FLOOR - DAY

      Bayard emerges from the stairs, fully expecting to see the
      vestiges of his own wake, and instead finds the room
      vibrantly alive, The Team hard at work and totally in
      command.

                Yes ma'am, we have a bus leaving at

                    (to Bayard)
                To help cover cost for the sound
                system, I thought, 'what would
                Bayard do?' So, I put in a call to
                Mr. Dubinsky of the ILGWU, and told
                him we'd just gotten a $10,000
                check from Mr. Reuther of the UAW.
                I'm now on with Mr. Reuther telling
                him t he reverse.

                This entire time, you've been
                waiting for me to offer something I
                I'm not ready to give. Maybe when
                I'm older, and most of the battles
                have been won, I'll free myself to
                fall in love. But until then I want
                you to know, you are my family. No
                secrets, no shame, just love.

      Tom smiles and nods because he can't speak. There is a knock.
      Charlene opens the door, her face flush with emotion.

                there are men who, wrapping
                themselves in a mantle of Christian
                morality, would violate the most
                elementary conceptions of human
                decency, privacy and humility in
                order to persecute other men.

                the entire Civil Rights Movement
                stands behind Mr. Bayard Rustin.

      Bayard is silent/stunned.

      JUMP TO: Dr. King at the microphones.

                          MARTIN (ON TV)
                Mr. Rustin is one of the most
                moral, one of the most decent human
                beings I have ever known. He is as
                committed to American democracy as
                any current elected official, and
                would fight to protect the rights
                of all, including those who would
                use the power of their positions to
                deny him his. I am proud to call
                him friend, and cannot think of a
                finer person to lead us in
                Washington D.C.

      Without warning, Bayard's emotions rush to the surface:
      tears, anger, frustration, hurt. Dr. Anna gently PLACES HER
      HAND AGAINST HIS BACK while he cries. And then just as
      abruptly, Bayard wipes his eyes and sm iles. He's ready and
      feels finally free.

                I'd say around 10. Wouldn't you
                agree?

      He hands Eleanor the blank piece of paper.

                          ELEANOR
                Agreed.

      MAHALIA JACKSON is singing, How I Got Over. Seated with the
      Big 10, DOROTHY HEIGHT, 51. Bayard and Mr. Randolph stand
      together, looking out at the OCEAN OF PARTICIPANTS.

                          ROY WILKINS
                    (standing nearby)
                I called it first? Aunt Bess
                brought the entire human race.

                          RANDOLPH
                Son, I am afraid this isn't 100,000
                people. I so wish Lucille was here.

                          BAYARD
                When Mahalia sings, angels descend.

      The SONG ENDS. As the MASSES ROAR, Randolph's eyes fill with
      tears.

117                                                            117

                    (calling out)
                Tell'em about the dream.

      As Martin pushes his notes aside - MOS



      Bayard beams with pride as his brother/friend takes the WHOLE
      WORLD TO CHURCH; he smiles as he takes in the FACES of
      STRANGERS in the Crowd, the FACES of DR. ANNA, CLEVE,
      ELEANOR, CHARLENE, TOM, NORM, DORIE, RACHELLE, et al.
      believi ng, feeling, rejoicing.
                                                         112.


                    MARTIN
          Let freedom ring from the mighty
          mountains of New York. Let freedom
          ring from the heightening
          Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let
          freedom ring from the snowcapped
          Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom
          ring from the curvacious slopes of
          California. But not only that, let
          freedom ring from Stone Mountain of
          Georgia. Let freedom ring from
          Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let
          freedom ring from every hill and
          molehill of Mississippi. From every
          mountainside, let freedom ring.

          And when this happens, and when we
          allow freedom to ring, when we let
          it ring from every village and
          every hamlet, from every state and
          every city, we will be able to
          speed up that day when all of God's
          children, Black men and White men,
          Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and
          Catholics, will be able to join
          hands and sing in the w ords of the
          old Negro spiritual: "Free at last.
          Free at last. Thank God almighty,
          we are free at last."

THOUSANDS ROAR. As Martin steps back, He and Bayard share a
look before Martin turns back and waves, as the CROWD
CONTINUES TO ROAR. Martin now belongs to the world.

Bayard looks to Mr. Randolph. It's time for the MARCH
DEMANDS, but instead, Randolph hands Ossie his speech.

                    OSSIE
          And now I bring to you, the
          executive director of the March on
          Washington. The man who organized
          this whole thing, Bayard Rustin!

Bayard is shocked. He looks to Randolph who gestures for
Bayard to take his rightful place. Bayard does.

                    BAYARD
          Ladies and Gentlemen! The first
          demand is: that we have effective
          civil rights legislation. No
          compromise! No filibuster!
                    (MORE)
                    (MORE)
                                                               113.
                          BAYARD (CONT'D)
                And that it includes public
                accommodation, decent housing,
                integrated education, and the right
                to vote! WHAT DO YOU SAY?!

      Bayard RAISES A FIST, and the 250,000 marchers ROAR WITH
      APPROVAL!

118                                                              118
      EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL / PODIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

      Randolph and Bayard are posing for a photographer. Dr.
      Hedgeman and the Big 10 linger nearby.

      Once they're done--

                          DR. ANNA
                Bayard, when I was a girl, every
                night my father would ask, "Have
                you been useful today?" I'm more
                than certain that has been true for
                you most of your life. But tod ay,
                my child... Today.

      They hug. And then--

                          DR. ANNA (CONT'D)
                Whitney, congratulations. Where is
                Mr. Farmer? I cant believe he'd
                miss his moment in the sun.

                          WHITNEY YOUNG
                He was arrested a few days ago in
                Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, for
                protesting against police
                brutality. Prior to his arrest,
                he'd gotten death threats.

      With ROY, RANDOLPH, BAYARD, JOHN--

                          ROY WILKINS
                Chief, the President has invited us
                to meet.

                          BAYARD
                Don't let him get away with a
                thing. Not after this.

                          RANDOLPH
                Trust me, that will not occur.

                          JOHN LEWIS
                You should be with us.
                                                               114.


                           BAYARD
                A few weeks ago, I said I'd happily
                act as trash collector if we pulled
                today off.

                          ROY WILKINS
                You are far more valuable to us
                than a trash collector.

                           BAYARD
                Roy, for shame! Ma Rustin taught me
                no man is less valuable because he
                picks up trash in order to care for
                his own.
                    (to John)
                Next time.

      Roy hustles Randolph/The Big 10 away. The Team watches as
      Bayard descends the steps of the Lincoln Memoria l.

      After introducing himself to the OTHER WORKERS, the CAMERA
      SLOWLY PULLS BACK until anonymity takes over, and Bayard
      becomes just ONE MORE VOLUNTEER helping to make things clean.

                                                  TEXT OVER THIS SHOT:

      "More than 250,000 people attended the March on Washington,
      making it the largest nonviolent demonstration to date."

      "In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, outlawing
      discrimination based on rac e, color, religion, sex or
      national origin."

      "In 1977, Bayard met Walter Naegle. They fell in love, and
      were inseparable until Bayard passed away in 1987."

      "After decades of going unrecognized for his role in the
      Civil Rights Movement, Bayard was posthumously bestowed the
      Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2013."
