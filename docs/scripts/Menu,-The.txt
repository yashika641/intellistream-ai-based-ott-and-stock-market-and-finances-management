    A nautical bell. Foghorns. Waves lapping the shore. Seagulls.


1   EXT. WATERFRONT DOCK - EVENING                              1

    A young COUPLE stand alone on a dock. They're dressed
    elegantly for a big night out.

    MARGOT stares off, a little bored. TYLER drums his hand
    against his leg. His eyes dart around, a little panicked.

                        TYLER
              What time is it?

    Margot looks at her watch nonchalantly.

                        MARGOT
              It is...6:26.

                        TYLER
              Shit.

                        MARGOT
              Tyler, relax.

                        TYLER
              No, sweetie, this is bad.

                        MARGOT
              I'm sure it's fine, babe.

                        TYLER
              Well, where is everybody?

                        MARGOT
              You're positive we're in the right
              place?

                        TYLER
              Yes. I followed the directions on
              the website exactly.

                        MARGOT
              Okay, well, then reset the mood.
              We've still got four minutes.

    Tyler nods, but he's unconvinced. Margot lights a cigarette.
    Tyler notices and grimaces disapprovingly.

                        TYLER
              Babe, please don't smoke. It'll
              kill your palette.
1                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)            2.


                        MARGOT
              Then my palette will die happy.

                        TYLER
              Hey.
                  (insistent)
              Margot.

    Tyler's tone stops Margot in her tracks. She looks at him.
    The mood is suddenly a little tense. He's dead serious.

                         TYLER (CONT'D)
              Tonight is huge, okay? The flavor
              profiles - it's all super delicate.
              When you smoke, you ruin your
              ability to appreciate them.
                  (beat)
              Please.

    After an edgy silence, Margot stamps out her cigarette.

                        MARGOT
              Fine. Jesus.

                           TYLER
              Thank you.

    A FOGHORN blows close by, startling both of them. A small but
    gorgeously appointed BOAT pulls into the harbor.

                           TYLER (CONT'D)
              Thank God.

                        MARGOT
              Is that gonna fit everyone?

                        TYLER
              Easily. 12 customers total.

                        MARGOT
              A night? How do they turn a profit?

                        TYLER
              850 a head, that's how.

    Margot nearly does a double-take.

                        MARGOT
              You're fucking joking right?

                        TYLER
              C'mon, let's not ruin this by
              talking price, yeah? Just go with
              the flow. Let it be magical.

    Margot just chuckles and shrugs.

                        MARGOT
              Hey, it's your dime.

    A MERCEDES pulls into the dock and parks. THREE RICH TECH-
    NERD BROS in their 30s and 40s-- BRYCE, SOREN, DAVE-- get
    out, a little drunk, a little rowdy.

                        BRYCE
              --just such a fuck-you to Accounts.
              It's not even a client dinner!

    They all laugh. Tyler looks at them with distaste.

                        TYLER
              Great. A power tasting. They'll be
              wasted by the amuse.

    Margot sees an OLDER COUPLE getting out of a Town Car.
    RICHARD (60s) gets the door for his wife ANNE (also 60s). As
    he does, he turns and briefly locks eyes with Margot. He
    seems to recognize her. Margot's eyes dart away instantly.

                        MARGOT
                  (under her breath)
              Fuck.

                        TYLER
              What?

                        MARGOT
              Huh? Nothing.

    A finely dressed BOATMAN lowers a gangway on the boat.

                        BOATMAN
              All aboard for Hawthorn!

                        TYLER
              I have to log every nuance of this.
              To silkscreen it on my brain.

    Most guests have now arrived. They file on the boat, showing
    tickets on their phones. As Tyler and Margot queue, Tyler
    notices someone behind them and averts his eyes.

                        TYLER (CONT'D)
              Ho-ly fucking shit. Don't look.

                        MARGOT
              What?
    1                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)           4.


        Margot looks and sees a MIDDLE AGED WOMAN in a colorful
        blouse and hip tortoise shell glasses and A MIDDLE AGED MAN.

                            TYLER
                  I said don't look?

                            MARGOT
                  What am I supposed to not be
                  looking at?

                            TYLER
                  Lillian Bloom.

                            MARGOT
                  Who's Lillian Bloom?

                            TYLER
                  Shh, just - food critic for Saveur.
                  Play it cool.

                            MARGOT
                  You're the one freaking out?

                            TYLER
                  She's running her Top 100 list this
                  month. I bet this makes the top
                  spot. She doesn't usually double up
                  with San Pellegrino but for Slowik?

                            MARGOT
                  No totally. I'm always saying that.

                            TYLER
                  Lillian goddamned Bloom. Well it's
                  official: Tonight will be madness.


2       INT. BOAT - EARLY EVENING                                     2

        Margot and Tyler step inside the main cabin of the boat. It's
        like something out of a fairy tale. Brass fixtures. Small
        tables with linen tablecloths. Floral arrangements. Ravel's
        "Une barque sur l'ocï¿½an" PLAYS dreamily.

        We hear the VOICE of the CAPTAIN on an intercom.

                            CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, please make
                  yourselves comfortable for our 30
                  minute journey to Hawthorn.

        Tyler is in heaven. He turns to Margot.
2                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)              5.


                         TYLER
              Not gonna lie, I am diamond hard
              right now.

    Margot makes a disgusted face. We hear VOICES off screen.

                        MALE VOICE (O.S.)
              We get a private room though right?

                         FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
              I checked. They don't do that here.

    Who should finally enter but none other than a famous middle-
    aged MOVIE STAR and his young assistant, FELICITY.

                        MOVIE STAR
              Yeah, no, that's fine. Totally
              fine. You definitely checked?

                        WAITER
              Welcome, sir.

    Movie Star sees the other passengers. Big smile.

                        MOVIE STAR
                  (suddenly "on")
              Ahoy! Avast me hearties! Let's hope
              she's seaworthy, eh?

    The Movie Star is given champagne. He eyes it with desire but
    hands it to Felicity, who politely gives it to the waiter.

    ON TECH BROS outside of Movie Star's earshot. Soren eyes him.

                        SOREN
              Whoop, famous person. We got an FP,
              folks.

                        BRYCE
              FP in the house.

                         DAVE
              Barely F anymore though? Maybe in
              like 1998?

                        BRYCE
              Hey, he's a P and he's F, what do
              you want?

    We SWING back to Margot and Tyler on two plush seats by the
    window. Tyler looks anxious. Margot smiles at him.

                        MARGOT
              Look at you.
2                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)           6.


                        TYLER
              I know. I have to say: I'm weirdly
              nervous.

                        MARGOT
              To eat dinner?

                        TYLER
              Right? It's crazy.

                        MARGOT
              No, it's cute.
                  (sees movie star)
              Oh wow. Check it out. I loved him
              when I was a kid.

                        TYLER
              Oh yeah. Apparently he's a big
              foodie. Or you know - thinks he is.

                        MARGOT
              He looks kinda like an alien in
              person?

    A WAITER steps forward holding a tray of food.

                        WAITER
              Chef Slowik would like to welcome
              you with a raw local oyster in a
              mignonette emulsion, with lemon
              caviar and an oyster leaf. Enjoy.

    Tyler and Margot take their trays.

                        TYLER
              Beautiful. Thank you.

    The waiters leave. Margot stares at her tray.

                        TYLER (CONT'D)
              One of his classics. The lemon
              pearls are made with an alginate.

    Tyler takes a quick photo with his phone before eating his.

                        MARGOT
              Alginate? As in-?

                        TYLER
              As in algae.

                        MARGOT
              Algae. Like from a pond. No,
              lovely.
    2                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)           7.


        Tyler's too busy greedily devouring his tiny bite to respond.

                            TYLER
                  Oh my god. It's laughable. It's
                  actually fucking laughably good.

        Margot cautiously tries it and nods her head.

                            MARGOT
                  Mmm. It's good. I'd be happy with
                  just the oyster, though. I love
                  oysters.

                            TYLER
                  No, no, it's the balance of the
                  products. You need the mouthfeel of
                  the mignonette.

                            MARGOT
                      (smiles)
                  Please don't say `mouthfeel.'

                            TYLER
                      (smiles back)
                  Too late.

        They share a warm beat. The HORN BLOWS as the boat sets sail.


3       EXT. OCEAN - EVENING                                          3

        The boat glides across the water, the ISLAND in the distance.


4       INT. BOAT - EVENING                                           4

        As the great Lillian Bloom holds court, we cut to close-ups
        of all the diners listening. We end on Margot, as though we
        are seeing them through her eyes.

                            LILLIAN BLOOM
                  Slowik has always had trouble
                  staying put. Cut his teeth with
                  Bocuse, a spell in Kyoto, stages
                  with Ferran in Spain just for the
                  fuck of it. Then he opens his own
                  place in New York, Tantalus. I
                  discover him. Then boom, two
                  Michelin stars.

        Tyler softly to Margot.

                        TYLER
              He didn't get the second star till
              year two, she's fucking up the
              story, but whatever --

                        LILLIAN BLOOM
              What's that?

                        TYLER
              Nothing. This is great. Go on.

                        LILLIAN BLOOM
              Then at the top of his game, he
              closes up shop. Disappears. Falls
              off the map. Must have lost a
              fortune on the lease.

    Tyler can't let it go. Annoyed, he whispers to Margot:

                        TYLER
              Also, she "discovered" him?
              Bullshit.

                        FELICITY
              Where did he go?

                        LILLIAN BLOOM
              Some say Lyon. Some say Hanoi of
              all places. No interviews, no
              photos, zip. I tried like hell to
              track him down, but he's a phantom.
              Now cut to three years after that.

              So I'm in Portland. Umbrellas,
              beards, heroin. Big food con.

                        TYLER
              Cascades Food Expo, right?

                        LILLIAN BLOOM
              Yes, well done. Huge arena full of
              pop-ups. And I think, if I have to
              eat one more deconstructed avant
              cassoulet whatever I'm gonna puke.
              So I leave and stop at a Korean
              taco truck a block away. And... I
              flip. It's like the Platonic ideal
              of a Korean taco. The Korean taco

    Margot blinks. The Korean what?

              I peek into the truck, and guess
              who's manning the grill. Julian
              fucking Slowik. I almost fall to my
              knees and start believing in God.
              And I get him to agree to an
              interview.

                        TED
              That's the famous piece Lillian
              wrote about him. Culinary

              Gregory of Tours.

              Stop. Anyway, suddenly every foodie
              investor is hounding him. He says
              he'll consider it on three
              conditions. One, complete privacy.
              Two, land to forage and plant.
              Three, it has to be by the water so
              he can source his own fish. That's
              when Doug Verrick swoops in and
              offers him a fucking island.

              He texted me personally last week
              with the invitation. I didn't even
              think he had a phone.

                        SOREN
              We were on a six-month waitlist but
              then I got an email a week ago
              saying tonight opened up. Lucky.

    As conversations splinter off, Tyler turns to Margot.

                        TYLER
              Pretty inspiring shit, yeah?

                        MARGOT
              Yeah I mean? Sorta grim too, right?

                          TYLER
              Grim?

                        MARGOT
              I don't know. Spending your entire
              life on a tiny island cooking for
              rich strangers? Bit of a nightmare?

    Tyler eyes Margot and smiles a bit condescendingly.

                        TYLER
              Well, Margot. Let me ask you. Do
              you love what you do?

                        MARGOT
              Sure, I like what I do.

                        TYLER
              But do you love what you do?

    Margot stares at Tyler blankly for a moment.

                          MARGOT
              No.

                        TYLER
              Me neither. But this guy does. And
              when you love what you do - I mean
              really love it - nothing else
              matters. Trust me he's got it made.

    The waiter appears.

                        WAITER
              May I take your dishes?

                            TYLER
                  Yes, please. Utterly ethereal.

        RICHARD looks at his phone while his wife sips champagne.

        Tyler puts his arm around Margot lovingly and they gaze out
        the window. The water sparkles in the early evening sun.

                            MARGOT
                  `Ooh, ahh, lovely view.'

                            TYLER
                      (smiles, charmed)
                  Such a little pestilence.

        Behind them, the dot-com guys are posing for a photo with the
        movie star. They are saying iconic lines from his movies.

        ON TYLER AND MARGOT.

                            TYLER (CONT'D)
                  It's already the best night. And
                  just think: It hasn't even started.

                               MARGOT
                  Yeah.

        Margot smiles. But it feels a little false.


5       EXT. OCEAN - EARLY EVENING                                      5

        The boat glides smoothly through the water.


6       EXT. HAWTHORN DOCK - EARLY EVENING                              6

        FRONT OF HOUSE lines the dock, smiling, poised.

        We follow Margot and Tyler as they disembark. It's very
        ceremonial. Margot's a bit unnerved by all the pomp.

                            MARGOT
                  Jesus. This is like prom.

                            TYLER
                  Yeah? I didn't go to prom.

                            MARGOT
                  Really, why not?

                            TYLER
                  None of the cool girls like you
                  said yes.

                        MARGOT
              Aw, poor baby. Fuck those bitches.

    She smiles at him, the coolest girl ever. Tyler likes it.

    The restaurant's captain, a severe woman named ELSA, checks
    the guests' names from a list. When Margot and Tyler reach
    Elsa in line, she smiles coldly.

                        ELSA
              Welcome to Hawthorn, Mister
              Ledford. And Miss-- Westervelt?

    Elsa looks puzzled. Margot, equally puzzled, looks at Tyler.

                        TYLER
              Oh, uh-- Right. Sorry. There was
              actually a change of plans. This is
              not Miss Westervelt, this is--

                        MARGOT
              I'm Margot. Nice to meet you.

    Elsa eyes her with a trace of suspicion. She smiles tightly.

                        ELSA
              Margot. Welcome. We'll endeavor to
              make your evening as pleasant as
              possible. Right this way.

    Elsa ushers them ahead. Tyler whispers to Margot:

                        TYLER
              Sorry. That was, uh-- That was a
              little awkward.

                         MARGOT
                  (smiles)
              It's fine.

    The boat leaves. Margot, it seems, is the only who notices it
    leave. She looks longingly at it as it sails away. And then
    she looks at this island. No way out. She snaps out of it.

    Nearby, the tech guys continue to chat with the Movie Star,
    who seems happy for the attention.

                        BRYCE
              So what are you working on now?

                        MOVIE STAR
              Top secret, bro. Don't worry about
              it. But I'm sort of moving into the

        Tyler overhears this and makes a face: `Like hell you are.'


7       EXT. CLEARING BY THE DOCK - EARLY EVENING                     7

        The guests are all assembled on a beautiful expansive lawn.
        Elsa stands before them. She smiles and addresses the group:

                            ELSA
                  Welcome to Hawthorn. You are all
                  part of an enormously special
                  evening. First of all, we recognize
                  it is not easy to secure a
                  reservation at our restaurant.
                      (smiles)
                  That alone makes you pretty
                  special, doesn't it?

        The group laughs nervously.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  But tonight is not like other
                  nights. Tonight's menu will be
                  different. Unusual. Tonight we will
                  tell you a story we've never told
                  before. And one we'll never tell
                  again. So let me warn you now:
                  Wonderful surprises await you all.

        ANGLE ON the excited FACES of the various guests.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  But first. Let us introduce you to
                  our home. Follow me please.

        All start walking -- except for the Liebrandts.

                            RICHARD
                  We'll wait here, if you don't mind.

                            ANNE
                  We've seen it. Many times.

                             ELSA
                  Yes, you have, haven't you?
                      (to the group)
                  The Liebrandts are very loyal
                  customers.


8       EXT. DRIFTWOOD BEACH - EVENING                                  8

        Elsa leads the rest of the group toward the gardens.

                            ELSA
                  Hawthorn Island comprises twelve
                  acres of forest and pasture. Our
                  owner purchased the island in 1989,
                  but we prefer to think of it as
                  ownerless. As wild. As a natural
                  outgrowth of the sea and the air
                  and the sky.

        ANGLE ON Margot listening to this pretentious speech.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  We have the bounty of the sea
                  surrounding us. Out there, right
                  now, we are harvesting scallops.
                  You'll eat them tonight!

        She waves at a GUY IN A ROWBOAT. As if on cue, he waves back.
        The guests join in and wave as well.

                            MOVIE STAR
                  Harvest harder my dude! We're
                  starving!

        Everyone laughs at what the famous guy said, even though it
        wasn't actually that funny. Felicity rolls her eyes.

        As they continue on walking, Lillian leans in to Ted --

                            LILLIAN BLOOM
                  I do like the sense of it being a
                  sort of biome of culinary ideas.

                            TED
                  Yes, like an - epicurean salon.

         Margot overhears this.

                             MARGOT
                   We have reached the base camp of
                   Mount Bullshit.

                             TYLER
                   I love it. Come on, let's catch up.


9        EXT. SMOKEHOUSE - EVENING                                     9

         Elsa removes a SLEEK, STYLIZED KEY RING and opens the door.


10       INT. SMOKEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                10

         All enter a room where MEAT and FISH hang on sharp hooks.

                             ELSA
                   Our smokehouse is in the Nordic
                   style. We use dairy cow meat only,
                   which we age for an astonishing 152
                   days to relax the protein strands.

                             DAVE (TECH BRO 3)
                       (laughs)
                   What happens if you serve it on the
                   153rd day? All hell breaks loose?

         Elsa smiles politely but coldly.

                             ELSA
                   Well, I suppose the bacteria might
                   introduce itself to the customer's
                   bloodstream, spreading into their
                   spinal membranes, at which point he
                   or she would become incapacitated
                   and shortly thereafter expire?

         Pause. Dave is silent.

                             ELSA (CONT'D)
                   So yes. All hell would break loose.

         Elsa laughs. They all laugh.

                             ELSA (CONT'D)
                   Good thing we're pros, yes? Come --

          The guests are taken through a beautiful garden.

                              ELSA
                    Wild sea beans, salmonberries and
                    sea lettuce are foraged from our
                    shores. And our gardens supply us
                    with no end of seasonal produce.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    Sorry, is this the time to mention
                    I have a severe peanut allergy?

                    You don't think I told them?

                    Oh, yes, we know, sir. We've
                    planned for that. And Mrs.
                    Liebrandt's shellfish allergy. And
                    Mr. Lorimer's gluten sensitivity,
                    though technically no such
                    condition exists.

          DAVE looks slightly offended.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    We learn all about our guests, and
                    Chef plans the menu accordingly.


13        EXT. GREAT LAWN. EVENING                                  13

          The group follows Elsa as the tour continues. Tyler squeezes
          Margot's hand romantically. She gives him a flirty eye.

          We PAN to the front. Lillian Bloom is takes notes.

                    Writing good things, I hope, Ms.

                    Mercia? Be fair, I wrote a very
                    kind review of Mercia.

                              ELSA
                    Well not completely, Ms. Bloom.

          ELSA smiles and opens a door.

14        INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING                                     14

          The group is led inside what looks exactly like a MILITARY
          BARRACKS, complete with bunk beds.

          We see also tiny SHOWER SPIGOTS, like at a YMCA, and a ROW OF
          TOILETS with no walls or doors, like at a prison.

                              ELSA
                    And this is where we live.

                              BRYCE
                    Wait, you guys actually live here?
                    All of you?

                              ELSA
                    All of us. Except Chef.

                              TED
                    Esprit de corps. Lovely.

                              ELSA
                    No, Mr. Feldman. It is more than
                    that. Here we are family.

          Tyler smiles, inspired. But Margot looks less sure.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    A common mission unites us, to run
                    the world's finest restaurant. We
                    work 80 hours per week if we're
                    lucky. And we're never lucky. Each
                    day starts at six with five hours
                    of prep work. We harvest. We
                    ferment. We slaughter. We marinate.
                    We liquify. We spherify. We gel.

                               MARGOT
                    You gel?

                              ELSA
                    We gel. Dinner is typically four
                    hours and twenty-five minutes.

          MARGOT reacts. That's long.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    Each day ends at well past two in
                    the morning. So yes, it's best that
                    we all live here.

                              SOREN
                    Don't you guys get burned out?

                              ELSA
                    `Burned out?'

          The phrase disgusts her. But she composes herself.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    Chef holds himself to the highest
                    standard, and so do we. We never
                    `burn' anything unless by design,
                    to make delicious.
                        (big, too big smile)
                    Now. Who's hungry?


15        EXT. GREAT LAWN - DUSK                                      15

          Tyler puts an arm around Margot. Dream date with dream girl.

                              TYLER
                    Chef will win you over by the end,
                    just wait. You'll be licking crumbs
                    from his hand like a Labrador.

                              MARGOT
                    Yeah, maybe? If we ever finish our
                    tour of Food Auschwitz.

                              TYLER
                        (chuckles)
                    Nice one.

          She snuggles against him as they walk. They both smile.

          As they approach the restaurant, Tyler notices a charming
          COTTAGE perched on a hill in a copse of trees.

                              TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me, Elsa. Who lives there?

                              ELSA
                    Chef.

                              TYLER
                    Are we seeing that?

                              ELSA
                    Even we are not allowed inside
                    Chef's cottage.

          Tyler nods, a bit chastened.

                              MARGOT
                        (whispers to Tyler)
                    We mustn't disturb the Lord High
                    Emperor of Sustenance.

                              TYLER
                    All right. Easy now.


16        EXT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DUSK                              16

          Elsa shows everyone inside and quietly locks the door.

          The room is minimalist and faux rustic. A touch sad even. A
          museum mood where one doesn't necessarily "enjoy" eating.

          A sad husk of a woman, LINDA (75), drinks wine at a small
          table abutting a wall. The diners are mildly confused by her
          presence. She nods at a few of them.

                              LINDA
                    Hello. Welcome.

          Everyone is shown to his/her seat. Elsa turns to Margot.

                                ELSA
                    Miss...?

                                MARGOT
                    Mills.

                              ELSA
                    Miss Mills. You will be sitting in
                    Miss Westervelt's seat. Enjoy.

          Margot makes a face. Was that really necessary?

          Richard and Anne sit at a table near Margot and Tyler.
          Richard's seat is positioned facing Margot. He notices this
          and looks concerned.

                              RICHARD
                    Switch seats with me.

                                ANNE
                    Why?

                              RICHARD
                    Just because. I want to have a
                    better view of the water.

          A weird request. Every seat has a view of the water.

                              ANNE
                    Fine.

          THE KITCHEN is open, visible from the dining area, the
          bustling staff hard at work. Tyler can't believe his eyes.

                              ELSA
                        (deeply pretentious)
                    Feel free to observe the cooks as
                    they innovate. But please do not
                    photograph our dishes. Chef
                    strongly feels that the beauty of
                    his creations lies in their
                    ephemeral nature.

                              MARGOT
                        (to Tyler)
                    And I strongly feel the need to
                    punch her in the cunt. Like an
                    uppercut. Right to the cunt.

                              TYLER
                    Here, come on. We can't miss this.

          Tyler leads Margot by the hand into...


17        INT. KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS                                     17

          ...Hawthorn's world-class machine of a kitchen, filled with
          COOKS OF ALL RANKS -- more cooks, in fact, than diners. Tyler
          watches a SOUS-CHEF (JEREMY) plate a cold, snow-like powder.

                              TYLER
                    Do you make that with a Pacojet?

                              JEREMY
                    Exactly right, sir.

                              TYLER
                        (to Margot)
                    A Pacojet can produce a powderized
                    snow-like texture.

                              MARGOT
                    Ah. Fascinating.

                              JEREMY
                    You really know your stuff, Mr.
                    Ledford.

                              TYLER
                    You know my name?

                    We like to know everyone who dines
                    with us.

                              TYLER
                    And Chef is around here somewhere?
                    I'd love to talk with him, if--

                              JEREMY
                    Why don't you take your seat?

          Tyler is unsure whether to feel offended until --

                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    We're about to serve.

                              TYLER
                    Yeah, okay. Sure. Thank you.


18        INT. DINING ROOM--CONTINUOUS                                 18

          LINDA still sits alone, idly playing with her empty wine
          glass. A cheery SOMMELIER approaches with a bottle.

                              SOMMELIER
                    More Lambrusco, madam?

          Linda nods silently.

          Back at Tyler and Margot's table, they sit down.

                              TYLER
                    The attention to detail, it's like -
                    fuck! He knew my name, babe!

                              MARGOT
                    I noticed you didn't ask his name.

                              TYLER
                    Shh. There he is.

          We get our first glimpse of the man himself: CHEF JULIAN
          SLOWIK(40s/50s), brooding, intense. Utterly focused, he
          glides swiftly from station to station, tasting.

          Elsa approaches Chef Slowik and talks softly to him. We don't
          hear what is said, but he looks in Margot's direction.

                              TYLER (CONT'D)
                        (looks away, excited)
                    Fuck me? Is he looking at me?
     18                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)             22.


          But he's looking at Margot. They lock eyes. In that moment
          the great chef and his guest share a type of recognition -- a
          sadness perhaps? A longing? Chef tersely breaks eye contact
          and resumes his tasks. The cooks around him continue to work
          with an almost sinister focus.

     MARGOT AND TYLER. Tyler holds his amuse just so and furtively
     snaps a photo. He will do this with every dish. ELSA notices.
     She will always notice. He eats the dish and is in heaven.

               You're funny.

     Margot considers, then:

                         MARGOT
               So... this is okay then? That I'm
               not as into it?

                         TYLER
               No, no. It's good. It's what I like
               about you, the `above it all.' I'm
               sitting with the coolest girl here.

                         MARGOT
               Okay, good. Didn't want to ruin
               your fun. Too much.

     She puts her hand on his leg.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               So what's with this food obsession?

     Tyler gathers himself and then...

                         TYLER
               I don't know. It's like - you know
               how people idolize athletes and
               musicians and, like, painters and
               stuff?

                          MARGOT
               Sure.

                              TYLER
                    Yeah, those people are idiots. What
                    they do doesn't matter. They play
                    with inflatable balls and ukuleles
                    and shit. Chefs play with the raw
                    materials of life itself. And death
                    itself. Like, I've watched every
                    fucking episode of Chef's Table two
                    or three times. I've watched
                    Slowik's probably twenty times.
                    I've watched him explain the exact
                    moment at which a green strawberry
                    is perfectly unripe. I've watched
                    him plate a raw scallop during its
                    last dying contraction of muscle.
                    It's art on the edge of the abyss.
                    Which is where God works too.

          Margot nods. Does she buy it?

                              MARGOT
                    That's beautifully put, Tyler.

                              TYLER
                    Oh stop it.

                              MARGOT
                    No really. I am starting to get it,
                    a little.

                              TYLER
                    Ah, see? Told ya you'd come around.

          Tyler looks pleased with his mansplain triumph. Margot looks
          out the WINDOW.

                                  FIRST COURSE

          CLOSE on Chef. He tastes something, closes his eyes and keeps
          them closed, deep in contemplation. Then he opens them.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Okay.

          We follow him into the dining room, where he surveys his
          guests, raises his hands and CLAPS. Once. Loud. All
          conversations stop. His staff stops. Everything stops.

          Chef Slowik stares at his diners, smiling tightly. This whole
          solar system revolves around him, the all-powerful sun.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Welcome to Hawthorn. I am Julian
               Slowik, and tonight it will be our
               pleasure to feed you.

     The diners applaud. Margot scrunches her face and plays
     along. Lillian and Ted exchange proud, possessive looks.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               The curtain rises.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Over the next few hours, you will
               ingest fat, salt, sugar, protein,
               bacteria, fungi, various plants and
               animals -- at times entire eco-
               systems. But I have to beg of you
               one thing. Just one. Do not eat.
                   (dramatic pause)
               Taste. Savor. Relish. Consider
               every morsel you place inside your
               mouth. Be mindful. But do not eat.
               Our menu is too precious for that.

     ON THE PATRONS, who look a little confused, especially the
     movie star. Tyler, however, is just lapping this up.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Look around you. Breathe deeply.
               Accept it. Accept all of it.
               Forgive. And on that note --
                   (smiles)
               Food!

     Servers fan out in perfect formation carrying exquisitely
     manicured plates.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Our first course is called "The
               Island."

     One of the plates lands on a table in a gorgeous, slow-motion
     CU product shot. Perfectly curated bits of flora and jewels
     of scallop meat rest artfully atop a smooth, icy rock.

     A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, "THE ISLAND. Foraged plants,
     scallop, seawater."

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               On your plate are plants from
               around the island, placed on rocks
               from the shore covered in barely-
               frozen, filtered seawater which
               will flavor the dish as it melts.

     Tyler smiles and whispers to Margot a little too loudly:

                         TYLER
               This is what the guy was fishing
               for earlier in the--

     The room is silent. Chef Slowik stares right at Tyler with a
     withering glare. Tyler tenses in his seat, mortified.

                         TYLER (CONT'D)
               Sorry, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
                   (smiles)
               It's perfectly all right. Yes, they
               are those very same scallops.
               Except, of course, for Mrs.
               Liebrandt. She has salmon.

     Anne smiles appreciatively.

                            ANNE
               Thank you.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
                   (back to the group)
               Here is what you must remember
               about this dish. We, the people on
               this island, are not important. The
               island and the nutrients it
               provides exist in their most
               perfect state without us gathering
               them, manipulating them or
               digesting them. What happens inside
               this room is meaningless compared
               to what occurs outside, in nature,
               in the soil and the water and the
               air. We are but a frightened
               nanosecond. Nature is timeless.
                   (warm smile)
               Enjoy!

     He returns to the kitchen. Diners exchange glances with their
     partners. Margot arches an eyebrow at the pomposity.

                         MARGOT
               Cheery thought.
                   (noticing)
               Um. Hey. Are you - crying?

                         TYLER
               Yeah. Sorry.
                   (laughs awkwardly)
               I know.

                         TYLER (CONT'D)
               It's just, I find it all very
               moving. It's all so...I don't know.
               It's just so beautiful.

     Tyler holds his phone just so and snaps a shot of his plate.
     Elsa clocks it. Simmering rage.

                         TYLER (CONT'D)
               It's almost too beautiful to eat.

     Margot looks at her plant-covered rock warily. She's not so
     moved. But then she smiles, as if remembering something.

                         MARGOT
               You know, the nicest restaurant in
               my hometown was this shitty red
               sauce place called Martini's that--

                         TYLER
                   (interrupting)
               You don't think Chef's mad at me,
               right? Because of the scallop
               thing?

                         MARGOT
               You don't have to address him as
               "Chef," Tyler. And no, I doubt he's
               even aware of your existence.

     Tyler keeps his eyes fixed on CHEF SLOWIK, who is intensely
     directing his staff in the open kitchen.

                         TYLER
               I know. It's just, I kind of want
               him to - ya know.

                         MARGOT
               To what? To like you?

                         TYLER
                   (laughs)
               Yeah. Kinda.

                         MARGOT
               You're a customer. You're paying
               him to serve you. It doesn't matter
               whether he likes you or not.

     Tyler nods, then considers this. He looks mildly offended.

                         TYLER
               Right. Wait. What does that mean?

               Nothing. Relax. You're good.

     The sommelier slides up, seemingly out of thin air.

               vineyard but a single row of vines.

     THE MOVIE STAR and FELICITY stare at their perfect plates.
     Neither lifts a fork.

     Movie Star pops a scallop in his mouth. Smiles.

                            FELICITY
               How is it?

                            MOVIE STAR
               Good!

                         FELICITY
               You're going to need to say more
               than "good" for the show.

                          MOVIE STAR
               It's not brain surgery, okay? It's
               a travel food show thing. I go to
               Italy, we shoot me in Capris on a
               pastel green Vespa driving to some
               Guiseppe's farm with cheese and
               there's a close-up of me eating the
               cheese and I close my eyes and fake
               an orgasm, then I'm off to South
               Africa or wherever and I eat goat
               and talk about how racism is maybe
               not so cool and bingo bongo there's
               your show.

     Felicity stares at him.

                         FELICITY
               Wait... is that it? That's the big
               pitch you're giving to three
               streaming services on Monday?

     We glide over to Lillian Bloom and Ted as they eat the dish
     with expressions of pure ecstasy.

                          LILLIAN BLOOM
               There's a neediness to the plating.
               Tweezered to fuck. But the flavors
               are there. Very clean, very...
               thalassic.

                            TED
               Thalassic?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Oceanic. Thalassa was the Greek
               primeval spirit of the sea. So.
               We're eating the ocean.

                         TED

     RICHARD AND ANNE sit eating silently like two live corpses.
     They could just as well be eating prime rib at a casino.

     Finally Anne barely speaks.

               I saw Perry at DeLaurenti's the

          And with that, the scintillating Perry chat is over.

          THE TECH BROS are in fact purely eating and drinking, not
          even looking at their plates as they talk.

                    The plating's a little schmance
                    though, right? And I've had
                    shellfish just as good at Kashiba,
                    or even with my chef at home. But
                    whatever. Now we can say we've been
                    here. As my dad used to say, "We're
                    buying an experience."

          ELSA stands against the wall, eyeing them with contempt.

          The staff prepares the next course. Chef looks up to stare at
          Margot, noting her tense posture and nearly-full plate. Then
          he sees Tyler extend his fork toward her food. Chef winces.

          all is quiet save for the lonesome, distant call of a loon.

                                  BREAD SERVICE


23        INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                   23

          Margot and Tyler wait for the next course. Tyler observes
          something about Margot and smiles. Margot notices.

                               MARGOT
                    What?

                              TYLER
                    Nothing. It's fun watching you in
                    this place. You're just so Margot
                    about it all.

                              MARGOT
                    Oh yeah? How so?

          Tyler examines and catalogues the specimen.

                               TYLER
                    This is your whole thing: You hate
                    these fancy places because you're
                    working-class and real and just a
                    true-blue down-home girl, all spiky
                    and snarky. That's so who you are.
                    I love it.

          Margot smiles and nods. She goes along with it.

                              MARGOT
                    Yeah, well? You grow up poor in
                    Philly like I did and then step
                    into a place like this? Yeah, sure.
                    Your fists go up a little.

          Tyler looks turned on by the notion of taking a fist in the
          face from a tough poor girl. Margot smiles playfully.

                              MARGOT (CONT'D)
                    You like that, huh?

                              TYLER
                    I like you.

                              MARGOT
                        (moment of sweetness)
                    I like you, too.

          Margot smiles at Tyler. Tyler really feels a connection.
23                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)           33.


                         TYLER
               Beautiful night.

     As Tyler looks out the window, he doesn't see Margot's smile
     gradually decreasing to a glare. No connection on her end.

     Chef Slowik CLAPS again. Margot jumps a little, startled.

                         MARGOT
               Is he going to keep doing that?

     Chef waits in silence a few moments. Too many moments.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Bread has existed in some form for
               over 12,000 years, especially
               amongst the poor. Flour and water.
               What could be simpler? Even today,
               grain represents 65% of all
               agriculture. Fruits and vegetables?
               Only 6%. Ancient Greek peasants
               dipped their stale, measly bread in
               wine for breakfast. And how did
               Jesus teach us to pray if not to
               beg for "our daily bread?" It is,
               and has always been, the food of
               the common man. But you, my dear
               guests, are not the common man. So
               tonight you get no bread.

     Margot actually chuckles -- you've got to be kidding.

     Servers place SHALE PLATES on the tables, along with a lovely
     parchment NOTE. Where there would normally be bread is an
     empty space surrounded by condiments -- creams, pickles, etc.

     A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, "BREADLESS BREAD PLATE: no bread,
     savory accompaniments."

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               In this spirit, please enjoy the
               unaccompanied accompaniments.

     MOVIE STAR'S TABLE. Felicity reads the parchment note.

                         FELICITY
               "The bread you will not be eating
               tonight was made from a heritage
               wheat called red fife, crafted with
               our partners at the Tehachapi Grain
               Project, devoted to preserving
               heirloom grains..."

                   (eating)
               I have to say, the shit around the
               table absence of bread is tasty.

     LILLIAN BLOOM AND TED.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Now this is a wickedly clever
               conceit. Slowik is famous for his
               bread. Tartine doesn't hold a
               candle. And tonight no bread?

                         TED
               Outrageous.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Fiendish, really. He's always been
               keenly aware of food as a history
               of class while still preserving a
               sense of the delicious.
                   (poking at a sauce)
               Although I will say the emulsion
               here does look slightly broken.

                         TED
               I didn't want to mention it, but I
               was just thinking the same thing.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               And you really --
                   (whispers)
               -- you really shouldn't see that in
               a restaurant of this quality. I'm
               frankly surprised. Minor quibble.
               But there it is.

     Chef Slowik sees this exchange.

     MARGOT AND TYLER.

                         TYLER
               Next level bad-assery. The way he
               weaves in historical allegories.
               The game is trying to guess what
               the over-arching theme of the
               entire meal is going to be. You
               won't know till the end.

                         MARGOT
               Wait, you like this? He's basically
               insulting us, isn't he?
23                   PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)        35.


                         TYLER
               No no no, you don't get it. It's a
               concept.

                         MARGOT
               I know what a concept is, Tyler.

                         TYLER
               No, trust me. He's telling a story.
               That's what makes his food so
               exciting. He's not just a chef.
               He's a storyteller. And he doesn't
               give a fuck about the rules.

                         MARGOT
               Yeah, well, call me the girl next
               door but maybe some rules you
               should give a fuck about.

     Tyler takes her hand, kisses it, and smiles mischievously.

                         TYLER
               My dearest, no one would ever call
               you the girl next door.

     Meanwhile, back at Lillian Bloom's table:

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               I bake my own bread at home, of
               course.

                          TED
               Oh?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Very rustic. Peasant style. Yeasty.

                         TED
               What kind of yeast do you use?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               I make my own. From apples.

                         TED
               Of course you make your own yeast
               from apples, you wicked thing.

     Elsa approaches with another, LARGER CONTAINER of the broken
     emulsion Lillian complained about.

                         ELSA
               Ms. Bloom, here is another broken
               emulsion. Courtesy of Chef Slowik.
23                   PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)         36.


     She points to the kitchen, where Chef Slowik offers a wave
     and warm smile. Lillian smiles nervously and waves back.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Oh, I -- thank you.

                         BRYCE
                   (calling to Elsa)
               Excuse me. Excuse me.

     Elsa heads to THE TECH-BRO TABLE.

                         ELSA
               Is everything to your liking, sir?

                         BRYCE
               Well, actually, no. Thanks for
               asking. I mean, look, the food's
               great and we totally get all the
               conceptual stuff. But could we
               please get a little bread? You guys
               are super-famous for your bread,
               and we don't know when we'll ever
               get a chance to eat here again.

                         SOREN
               Everybody always talks about your
               amazing bread.

                           ELSA
               Yes. And?

                         BRYCE
               Could we please just try some of
               your bread? You know, and some
               gluten-free for my friend as well?

                           ELSA
               No

                           BRYCE
               No?

                           ELSA
               No.

     The men exchange an exasperated look.   Elsa stares coldly.

                         BRYCE
               This is all very clever and, I
               didn't want to play this card, but
               you know who we are, right?
23                    PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)         37.


                            ELSA
               Yes.

                         SOREN
               You do. You know who we are.

                         ELSA
               I know who you are.

                         SOREN
               You know we work with Doug Verrick.

                         ELSA
               No, you work for Mr. Verrick.

     Lillian and Ted overhear. Lillian makes a "yikes" face.

                         DAVE
               Exactly. So you know we all play on
               the same team. So just slip us a
               little bread. Please.

                         SOREN
               We won't tell a soul.

                            ELSA
               No.

                         BRYCE
               Did you say no?

                            ELSA
               I said no.     Yes.

                            BRYCE
               Okay. Wow.

     Elsa leans in to speak in a menacing whisper.

                         ELSA
               You will eat less than you desire
               and more than you deserve.

     She spins and walks away.

     MARGOT and TYLER. Margot is not eating. Chef stares at her.

                         TYLER
               Well if you're not going to eat,
               I'm gonna eat.

     Tyler reaches over and picks up her entire plate to exchange
     it with his own empty one. He tries to do it carefully but
     bumps a wine glass with his elbow. It SHATTERS on the ground.
     23                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          38.


          Two servers appear to clean up the mess. Tyler is mortified.
          Now Tyler spots Chef Slowik marching over to their table.

                              TYLER (CONT'D)
                    So, so sorry. Total accident.

          Chef focuses solely on Margot.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    You haven't touched your food.

                              MARGOT
                    Yeah, sorry. A lot of food coming,
                    right? Don't want to fill up.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    That would not be possible. I've
                    precisely designed the portions to
                    account for that. Please eat. The
                    menu only makes sense if you eat.

                              MARGOT
                    But you told us not to eat.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    This is not what I meant, madam.
                    And you know it.

                              MARGOT
                    Thanks, but I'll eat what I want to
                    eat. And when.

          Chef half-smiles and half-grimaces. No one talks to him like
          this. He walks away. Tyler looks sick.

                              TYLER
                    Jesus. That was humiliating.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm not humiliated. He's a prick.

          AT LINDA'S TABLE.

          Chef kneels and gently takes her hand. She looks at him with
          glazed, wounded eyes. He smiles at her understandingly. She
          weakly smiles back. Chef kisses her forehead and heads into --

          Tall, spindly evergreens shiver in the cold darkness.

26        INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                   26

          RICHARD and ANNE silently await more food. No eye contact.

          MARGOT AND TYLER. The sommelier arrives.

                              SOMMELIER
                    Here's a 2009 Valpolicella Classico
                    Superiore from Tommaso Bussola,
                    which we've hyper-decanted with an
                    immersion blender. Slavonian oak.
                    Rich cherry and tobacco notes. A
                    faint sense of longing and regret.

          Margot smiles as the sommelier walks away.

                              MARGOT
                    Mmm. Longing and regret. My
                    favorite.

          Margot glances over at Richard and Anne's table. She looks at
          Anne staring off. Anne feels Margot's eyes on her. Anne then
          looks at Margot and Margot looks away.

                              ANNE
                    She's staring again.

                                 RICHARD
                    Uh-huh.

                    Where do we know her from?

                                 RICHARD
                    We don't.

                              ANNE
                    She really does look like Claire.

                         RICHARD
               Why do you keep saying that? She
               doesn't.

                         ANNE
               You don't think so?

                         RICHARD
               She's nothing like our Claire.

     There is something sad in Anne's face as she watches Margot.

                         ANNE
               That same faraway face --

                         RICHARD
               Can we not obsess? Please?

     A touchy topic. Anne looks away. They sip their wine.

     We hear Chef Slowik's CLAP.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               The next course is called "Memory."
               That's what it's meant to evoke --
               a memory. Let me tell you one of
               mine. When I was a child growing up
               in Waterloo, Iowa, Tuesday was taco
               night. Taco Tuesday!

     The guests smile, but his enthusiasm feels forced and odd.
     Chef Slowik puts his hand on Linda's shoulder.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               This is my mother. As you can see,
               she is rather drunk. This is not
               unusual. When I was seven years
               old, one Tuesday my father came
               home quite drunk. Also not unusual.
               Mother grew angry and screamed at
               him. At which point he proceeded to
               wrap a telephone cord around her
               neck and pull it tight. I wept and
               screamed and begged him to stop.
               To make him stop, I finally had to
               stab him in the thigh with kitchen
               scissors. You remember that,
               mother, don't you?

     Linda reacts vaguely, continues drinking.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I suppose I should have stabbed him
               in his throat that evening. But we
               are not so smart when we are young.

     The diners exchange uneasy glances. Lillian turns to Ted with
     a reassuring look -- "Don't worry, all par for the course."

     Margot, however, watches Chef intently and with empathy, as
     if understanding his pain. Noticing, Chef locks eyes with her
     and says the next line directly to her.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Well. It was, as you can imagine, a
               very memorable taco night.

     Servers appear and set down plates fashioned out of coiled
     telephone cords, as well as bowls of tortillas. On the plates
     are chicken thighs with TINY SCISSORS sticking out of them.

     A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: "MEMORY. Marinated grilled
     chicken thigh, tortillas, green salsa cubes, red salsa halo."

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Here you have house-smoked Bresse
               chicken thighs al pastor and our
               own tortillas made with heirloom
               masa--one of Hawthorn's signature
               dishes. We change our menu
               constantly, but, as Miss Bloom
               knows, this has been a staple since
               day one.
                   (turning to her)
               It's what you once said --

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Put you on the map.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Put me on the map. And precisely
               what map would that be?

     Chef lets this rhetorical question hang in the air.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Anyways, because we are always
               innovating-- because we fear
               irrelevance...

     Movie star reacts.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               ...an update to a classic: images
               on the tortillas have been made
               using a laser engraving machine. We
               hope this taco night evokes strong
               memories for us all.
                   (warm smile)
               Enjoy.

     LILLIAN BLOOM examines her tortillas: images of buildings.

               What are they, Lil?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               They're - restaurants.

                         TED
               Restaurants?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               That I reviewed That -- that
               closed.

     She holds one with a sign reading "MERCIA."

                         TED
               Oh. So, it's like a - gag?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
                   (chuckles nervously)
               I think so? Odd, isn't it?

     RICHARD AND ANNE examine their tortillas. The first reads,
     "Happy Anniversary, Mr. and Mrs. Liebrandt." Anne is touched.
     The other tortillas show what looks like Richard and Anne
     sitting at their table during previous Hawthorn visits.

                         ANNE
               Richard, what are these?

                         RICHARD
               Taco things. For the tacos.

                          ANNE
               I mean the pictures. Look, they're
               all of us.

     Richard dons his glasses.

                         ANNE (CONT'D)
               Oh, look at this one, Dick. This
               one was after you had that melanoma
               removed from your forehead.
               There's the bandage. Isn't this
               nice? They remembered us.
                   (squinting at another)
               Huh. That's you... but who's that
               woman?

     She picks it up to reveal a tortilla which has been engraved
     with a B&W image of a man who looks like Richard sitting at a
     restaurant table with a young woman.

               Richard, who is that?

                         RICHARD
               How the hell should I know? It's
               faked. Some sort of stupid joke.

     He grabs the tortilla from his wife's hands.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
               This whole place is a fucking joke.

     Anne just stares at him.

     THE TECH BROS discover tortillas printed with dense blocks of
     FORMATTED TEXT, like business records.

                         SOREN
               What the fuck?

                         DAVE
               Are these --? How did they --?

                            BRYCE
               That's it.

     He slams a tortilla on the table and waves Elsa over.

                         ELSA
               Can I help you, sir?

                         BRYCE
               What the hell are these?

                         ELSA
               These are --
                   (perfect accent)
               -- tortillas. Tortillas deliciosas.

                         BRYCE
               I said what are these?

                         ELSA
               These are tortillas which contain
               Echobright's tax records and other
               documents showing how your company
               has hidden transactions with shell
               companies and created invoices with
               fake charges.

               I'm sorry, but Chef never reveals
               his recipes.

                         SOREN
               Do you know how fucked you are?
               We'll have you shut down by
               morning.

                         ELSA
               Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

     The MOVIE STAR and FELICITY examine their tortillas.

                         FELICITY
               Looks like they're all the same.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Indeed. Indeed they are.

     Each depicts a MOVIE POSTER -- the same movie poster. For a
     middling comedy called Calling Dr. Sunshine.

                         MOVIE STAR (CONT'D)
               Calling Dr. Sunshine.

                         FELICITY
               Huh. Forgot about that one.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Dumb part. Bad script. Fun shoot.

     TYLER examines their tortillas, crestfallen.

                         MARGOT
               What's on them?

                         TYLER
               They're all me... from tonight.

     Margot looks. Each shows Tyler sneaking photos of the food.

                         MARGOT
               Jesus. What's with this guy? This
               means they've been photographing us
               the whole night.

     Margot looks around. She actually does see a few small
     spherical ceiling cameras. But Tyler's too shattered to care.

                         TYLER
               I knew it. He hates me. God damn
               it. I didn't think he'd really
               mind. Should I apologize?

                         MARGOT
               What? Why would you apologize? They
               have no right to--

     A flustered Tyler angrily cuts her off.

                         TYLER
               Just fucking stop talking and let
               me think, okay? I have to make this
               right somehow. I have to.

                         MARGOT
               I'll tell you how: Send it back.

     Margot turns to wave a server over.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                         TYLER
               Hey. Hey! Margot!

     Tyler snaps his fingers at Margot violently.

                         MARGOT
               Did you just snap at me?

     Tyler glares at her with cold, remorseless eyes.

                         TYLER
               Are you out of your mind? Do you
               know how long I've been trying to
               get a reservation here?

                         MARGOT
               No, and I don't care! This is--

                         TYLER
               You don't send shit back to this
               kitchen, you child. You thank them
               for even letting you in the door.

     Margot reels back, stunned.

                         MARGOT
               What did you just call me?

                         TYLER
               I called you a child because that's
               what you're fucking acting like.

                         MARGOT
               Tyler, you need to apologize to me
               now. You can't talk to me like--

                    Well, yeah, actually I can. Because
                    -- ding dong! -- I'm the one who's
                    paying. So, maybe, shut up and eat?

          He angrily makes a taco, takes a bite. His rage disappears.

                              TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god. Oh my god, this is
                    incredible. You have to try this.

          Margot just stares at him, her eyes burning with contempt.

                              MARGOT
                    Don't let me interrupt.

          She throws her napkin on her chair and leaves the table.


27        INT. SIDE HALLWAY                                            27

          En route to the ladies' room, Margot stops at a stunning
          SILVER DOOR molded in an ornate floral pattern. Curious, she
          slowly reaches for the handle.

                              ELSA
                    Can I help you, madam?

          Margot turns to see a disapproving Elsa.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm looking for the ladies room.

                              ELSA
                    To your right.

                              MARGOT
                    What's behind this door?

                    Something very special.

          Margot enters the dim, modernist bathroom and locks the door.

          She stops and suddenly sits down on the tiled floor. She's
          breathing heavily, almost hyperventilating with rage.

                               MARGOT
                    Stop it.

     She gets a cigarette from her purse, cracks a tiny window and
     lights up. She notices an artsy framed photo on the wall
     showing a marshmallow roasting on a campfire.

     She gazes out the window and sees a curious sight: a COOK
     carrying a pair of large costume angel wings across the lawn.

     Suddenly the LOCK turns on the door. Margot flicks the
     cigarette out the window. Chef Slowik enters. He looks upset.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Hey, what are you - ?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I would like to know, specifically,
               what it was about the last course
               that you did not enjoy?

                         MARGOT
               The - what?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You've barely eaten the food. Why?
               I need to know. Why don't you eat?

                         MARGOT
               Why do you care?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I take my work very seriously, and
               you are not eating. That wounds me.

     Margot can see he's actually quite hurt about this.

                         MARGOT
               I guess I'm just not very hungry.

     He takes a slow, deliberate step toward her. He's harder now.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I've told you who I am. I'm Julian
               Slowik and I am the chef here. Now--

     He takes two slow, deliberate steps forward. Margot steps
     back until her BACK is against the wall.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Who are you?

     Margot is speechless.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I'll ask again. Who. Are. You.

          Margot composes herself.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm Margot Mills.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    And where are you from Margot?

                               MARGOT
                    Seattle.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    No. Where are you from?

          She stares at him, trying to read him.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm from Grand Island, Nebraska.
                    Okay? You want the address for my
                    mom's trailer, asshole? Excuse me.

          She tries to move past him but he blocks her.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    No, not who you want me to think
                    you are. Who are you?

          Margot is thrown. Her usual game isn't working.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm Margot.

          She slips around Chef Slowik and thinks she is about to get
          out the door, when Chef Slowik stops the door with his hand.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    You shouldn't be here tonight.

                              MARGOT
                    Get the fuck out of the way.

          No one talks to him this way. He's impressed, curious. Margot
          exits the bathroom.

          Meanwhile the movie star puzzles some more over his tortilla.

                              FELICITY
                    Maybe he's a fan of the movie?

                    I don't think so.

               Why not?

                         MOVIE STAR
               Because nobody's a fan of that
               movie.

                         FELICITY
               I'm sure it's just a joke. You're
               friends with him, right?

                         MOVIE STAR
               I mean, `friends'? Do I have
               friends? I know him?
                   (looking dead at Felicity)
               Are you my friend?

     Margot returns. Before she sits she kisses Tyler, violently.

                         MARGOT
               Watch your mouth, sweetheart. Or
               I'll smack the taste right out of
               it. Okay?

                          TYLER
               I -- Okay.
                   (he likes it)
               Sorry.

     Richard looks at Margot from across the way. She catches his
     eye and winks at him. Richard quickly looks away.

     As Elsa passes his table, Richard snaps at her a bit.

                         RICHARD
               Tell your boss if he thinks I'm
               paying for those tacos he's nuts.

               I'll be sure to tell him.

               Dude, chill. It's a fucking taco.

                         BRYCE

                    We all have plausible deniability.
                    And if they try and turn us in --

                              SOREN
                    Right. Then they're turning Verrick

                    fucked as we are. We're fine.
                        (unsure)
                    Right?

          They sit with this thought. Then, shrugging, they make tacos.

                                  THIRD COURSE

          The patrons silently watch two servers methodically unrolling
          a TARP across the middle of the floor and smoothing out all
          the wrinkles. Other servers arrive with decorative baskets
          and cover the tarp with sea fennel and edible flowers.

                              TED
                    Theatrical. But minimalist, like in
                    the Japanese minimirasuto style.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM
                    Mm. They were being playful, yes?
                    With the tacos?

                              TED
                    Stop worrying. It's a dialogue.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM
                    No I know. I think the concept just
                    - missed the mark for me.

          Margot watches the team unfold the plastic tarp and then
          looks at Chef Slowik, who is staring at her. He continues to
          stare, and then a LOUD CLAP. This time, Margot isn't fazed.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    We are ready for our next course,
                    which I think you'll find --

                        (rising to his feet)
                    Excuse me. But what exactly is
                    going on here?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Yes, if you would let me finish?
                   (motions for him to sit)
               Please.

     Elsa calmly re-folds the tech bro's napkin for him. It does
     have a certain calming effect. The Tech Bro sits back down.

                         MARGOT
               Tyler, I don't like this. Can we--

                         TYLER
               Shh. It's fine. Relax.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Ladies and gentlemen, please meet
               sous-chef Jeremy Loucks.

     A chef around thirty strides out of the kitchen and stands in
     the middle of the tarp. He stares straight ahead, stoic.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Jeremy created the next dish. It's
               called "The Mess." Jeremy, may I
               explain "The Mess?"

                            JEREMY
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Originally from Sparks, Nevada,
               Jeremy studied at the Culinary
               Institute in Hyde Park. Jeremy's
               goal, as he wrote in a heartfelt
               letter, was to work for me here at
               Hawthorn. Isn't that right, Jeremy?

                            JEREMY
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Jeremy is talented. He's good.
               He's very good. But he's not great.
               He will never be great. He
               desperately wants my job, my
               prestige. My talent. He aspires to
               greatness, but he will never
               achieve it. Correct, Jeremy?

                            JEREMY
               Yes, Chef.
30                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)            53.


                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Jeremy is like me at his age. He
               has forsaken everything to achieve
               his goals. He works twenty hours a
               day. No time for friends. Or
               family. He can't go to the park or
               see a movie or stop at the bank.
               Jeremy, when's the last time you
               called your mother?

                         JEREMY
               I don't remember, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Like mine, his life is pressure.
               Pressure to put out the best food
               in the world. Pressure to please
               his Chef. Pressure to please the
               customers. And the critics. And
               even when all goes right, and the
               food is perfect, and the customers
               are happy, and the critics are too,
               there is no way to avoid The Mess.
               The Mess you make of your life, of
               your body, of your sanity, by
               giving everything you have to
               pleasing people you will never
               know. Jeremy, do you like your
               life, this life you dreamed about?

                           JEREMY
               No, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Do you want my life?

     Sweating, Jeremy looks at Chef. He wasn't expecting this.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               It's okay. You can answer. Do you
               want my life? Not my position or my
               talent. My life.

                         JEREMY
                   (tears in his eyes)
               No, Chef.

     Chef gently touches Jeremy's head and kisses his cheek.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Ladies and gentlemen, your fourth
               course. Sous-chef Jeremy's Mess.
30                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)             54.


     Chef takes a step back. Jeremy removes a pistol from the back
     waistband of his apron and BLOWS HIS BRAINS OUT.

     Everyone shrieks as blood splatters on the walls and the
     floor and on their faces -- including on Linda, who continues
     to drink, unfazed. Jeremy falls backwards.

     The kitchen staff all look for a second, then return to work.

     Chef Slowik takes in the horrible sight, CRYING a little,
     mourning. Servers rush over and, with practiced efficiency,
     roll up the tarp with Jeremy's body inside.

     Panicked and screaming, many diners rise from their seats and
     run toward the door. Servers and cooks rush out to block
     their way, but more reassuring than threatening.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Please. Please. Sit. Make
               yourselves at home. Everything's
               fine. All part of the menu. All
               just part of the show.

     As the shocked diners are corralled back to their tables by
     the cooks, servers approach tables with perfectly-folded
     moist washcloths so diners can wipe their faces. Still other
     servers fan out with PLATES for the tables.

     A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, "THE MESS. Pressure cooked
     vegetables, roasted filet, potato confit, beef jus, bone
     marrow. R.I.P. Jeremy Loucks, 1990-2022."

               No, no, it's theater. It's just--
               stagecraft. It's part of the menu.

                         SOREN
               The fuck are you talking about? He

     Chef sees everyone shocked, not eating.

     MARGOT AND TYLER haven't moved. In fact, Tyler is now eating.

               Tyler, what -- what's happening?

               This is a biodynamic Cabernet

               at Clos de l'Elu in the Loire
               Valley. No added sulfites. A bit of

     They rush to the front door, but Elsa runs to stand in their
     way. Everyone else watches to see how this goes.

                         ELSA
               Is something wrong?

               phone service.

                         RICHARD
               Fucking move!

     He tries to push past when two cooks with cleavers appear.
     The other diners squirm, some even stand instinctively.

                         ANNE
               Oh, Jesus. Richard, just do what
               they say, for God's sake.

                         RICHARD
               Let me handle this. I'll handle
               this.

                         ELSA
               With which hand?

                         RICHARD
               What?

                         ELSA
               With which hand will you "handle"
               this, Mr. Liebrandt? Left or right?

                         RICHARD
               What the fuck are you saying?

                         ELSA
               Shall we choose?

                         RICHARD
               Choose what?

                         ELSA
               Very well. Left hand. Ring finger.

     One cook grabs Richard and forces his left hand onto a table.
     The other one tries to aim, but Richard squirms.

                         ELSA (CONT'D)
               Mr. Liebrandt, please hold still.

     He looks at her for a split second and freezes, giving the
     cook the opening to chop his finger off. Everyone screams. It
     seems pretty clear now that this must be for real. Right?

                         ELSA (CONT'D)
                   (to the room)
               Please stay seated. Thank you.

     A petrified MOVIE STAR and FELICITY watch the chaos.

                         MOVIE STAR
               This is real, isn't it?

                         FELICITY
               I think so.

                         MOVIE STAR
               I can't do this, a whole hostage
               thing. I can't--

                         FELICITY
               Could you talk to him - I mean,
               because, you know him?

                         MOVIE STAR
               Uh huh? Yeah, I made that up?

     She looks at him. Jesus.

     RICHARD writhes in pain on the floor. Two servers gently wrap
     a linen napkin around his bleeding finger stump and tie it
     with decorative ribbon. Elsa picks up his finger from the
     table, slides the wedding ring off and offers it to Anne.

                         ELSA
               Your husband's ring, madam.

                         ANNE
                   (in a daze)
               Thank you --

     LILLIAN BLOOM watches. This can't be real, right?

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Maybe this is for our benefit?
               Just for us? That's why he texted
               me. This is incredible.

     Ted nods, stunned, and leans over to the movie star.

                         TED
               The actors are astonishing.

     Anne overhears this as she walks Richard back to their table.

                              ANNE
                    We're not actors. We're real
                    people.

          MARGOT AND TYLER. Margot watches in stunned silence as a
          blood-spattered Tyler quietly eats his food. To Margot's
          horror, he seems to be actually enjoying it.

                              MARGOT
                    Jesus Christ.

          It is becoming clear to Margot that she is facing this alone.

                              ELSA
                    Miss Mills, please join Chef Slowik
                    in the kitchen.

                               MARGOT
                    What?

                              ELSA
                    Chef would like you to join him in
                    the kitchen. Right now. Please.

                              TYLER
                    Can I come, too?

                               ELSA
                    No.

          Tyler watches helplessly as Margot follows Elsa toward the
          kitchen. COOKS guard the entrance, but Elsa waves them aside.


31        INT. KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS                                     31

          Scared but brave, Margot enters and stands face to face with
          Chef. He looks her up and down and shakes his head.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    No. No, I'm sorry but you're all
                    wrong.

                              MARGOT
                    Why are you doing this?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    You're just, simply wrong.

                              MARGOT
                    What are you talking about?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Who are you?
31                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)   59.


                         MARGOT
               I'm Margot.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I've served many Margots. You are
               not a Margot. Who are you?

                         MARGOT
               What the fuck does it matter?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               It matters because this menu, this
               guest list, this entire evening,
               has been painstakingly planned. And
               you were not a part of that plan
               and it's spoiling everything. In
               order to proceed, I need to know
               where to seat you: With us or with
               them? It's really very important.

                         MARGOT
               And then you'll - let me live?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               No, of course not. That would ruin
               the menu. We're all going to die
               tonight.
                   (to the kitchen)
               Isn't that right?

                            ENTIRE KITCHEN
               Yes, Chef!

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               So do you want to die with those
               who give or with those who take?

                          MARGOT
               But I die either way. It's
               arbitrary.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               It is not arbitrary. Please pick.

                         MARGOT
               You've lost your mind. You're sick.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               What I've done here over the years
               is sick. Yes. But right now, my
               mind has never been clearer.

     He believes it.

          At that moment, the movie star tentatively tries to enter.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    Hi, sorry. Chef I don't know if you
                    remember, we've met before, and--

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Leave my kitchen at once.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    Got it! Yes, absolutely, sir.

          He immediately leaves.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    I don't want to rush you.

          He sets a KITCHEN TIMER.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                    Our menu is strictly timed. In 15
                    minutes I'll have a break between
                    courses. That is how long you have
                    to decide. Our side or theirs. In
                    the meantime, please return to your
                    seat. The next dish is exquisite.
                        (turning away, clapping)
                    Plating in five!

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                    Yes, Chef!

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    I love you all!

                              ENTIRE KITCHEN
                    We love you, Chef!

          Put yourself in Margot's shoes. Mass psychosis.


32        INT. HAWTHORN DINING ROOM - NIGHT                            32

          Margot returns to a wide-eyed Tyler.

                              TYLER
                    Did you get a kitchen course? You
                    did, didn't you? God damn it, it's
                    not fucking fair, why do you get a
                    kitchen course?
                        (calming himself)
                    What was it? Protein or veg?
     32                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          61.


          Margot just stares at this creature, utterly bewildered. She
          slaps him. Hard. He stares at her.

                              TYLER (CONT'D)
                    Protein or Veg?

                                  Fourth Course

          The TECH BROS quietly conspire at their table.

                              BRYCE
                    So, so, what's the play here? What
                    are our options?

                              DAVE
                    The door is locked and guarded. The
                    windows - ?

          The movie star overhears and joins in.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    We've got forks, though? Knives?

                              SOREN
                    Yeah, fucking butter knives.

                              DAVE
                    And you think we have better knife
                    skills than them?

                              BRYCE
                    So what, then? We bargain?

          Suddenly Soren rises to his feet, picks up his chair and
          hurls it at one of the big bay windows. It bounces right off
          of the thick reinforced pane.

          A few burly SERVERS step forward with knives, ready for Soren
          to bolt. There's nowhere for him to go. So he just screams.

                              SOREN
                    GAH!!! FUCK!!!

          Elsa perfectly places Soren's chair back at his table. The
          cheery sommelier arrives at Margot and Tyler's table.

                              SOMMELIER
                    Everyone all set with wine?

                              MARGOT
                    Fuck yourself.

     Chef enters. CLAP!

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               There's a saying: "Sometimes all
               you need is a good cup of tea." I
               learned that growing up in
               Bratislava.

     Some guests exchange glances. Didn't he say Iowa earlier?
     Maybe a weird appreciative smirk from Margot.

                         BRYCE
               Please. Just let us go free.

                          CHEF SLOWIK
                   (puzzled)
               I am.
                   (beat)
               I've found that not only does tea
               cleanse the palate, but it offers a
               soothing balm when facing some
               hard, home truths.

     SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: `PALATE CLEANSER- wild bergamot and
     red clover tea."

     Servers fan out with bowls filled with the tea.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               So, before we continue, are there
               any questions about me or Hawthorn
               or why none of us are getting out
               of here alive?

     This is the first time everyone is hearing this. It's silent.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               No questions?

     People are hesitant to raise their hands. Tyler does.

                         TYLER
               Is this bergamot I'm getting Chef?

     Some people glare at Tyler: `That's the question you ask?'

                            CHEF SLOWIK
               Yes it is.

     The movie star raises a tentative hand.

                            CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Yes?

               I suppose I -- I'd like to know--

                         SOREN
               Why the fuck is this happening?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Okay. Well. Think of yourselves as
               ingredients in a degustation
               concept. Figuratively speaking.
               That's the best way to describe it.

     The diners are puzzled.   What the fuck is he talking about?

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               But none of this should be a
               surprise to most of you. Ms. Bloom
               -- Lillian, if I may -- my
               cherished early advocate, knows the
               damage she has done to so many
               livelihoods.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               Now, hold on, Chef, I've been very--

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You don't talk. I was happy in my
               little taco truck. I was fine. It
               was the happiest I've ever been.

     Margot clocks that remark. Skeptical.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                   (to Ted)
               And you, you enable her filth. You
               buttress. You coddle.

     Ted looks offended. Then a server approaches Lillian Bloom
     and sets down a comically LARGE NEW CONTAINER.

                         SERVER #2
               More broken emulsion, madam.

     Lillian Bloom stares at it. How is this happening?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You loved that I texted you an
               invitation for this evening. Me
               yearning for your attendance.

     Lillian might nod her head. Sure. Fine. He's right.

               That is to be expected. And you
               have fed my ego as well, sadly.

     Elsa appears near Margot and gestures to the TIMER in her
     hand. The texture of reality grows stranger by the moment.

                         ELSA
               10 minutes, Miss Mills.

     Anne speaks up.

                         ANNE
               Please, my husband! He needs to go
               to the hospital!

                         RICHARD
               I'm fine. Just let my wife go.

     Chef glares at Richard and Anne.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               My loyal regulars. How many times
               have you eaten here in the last
               five years?

                         RICHARD
               I, I don't know. Six? Seven?

                         ANNE
                   (under her breath)
               I think more than that, Dick...

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Eleven. Eleven times. Most people
               consider themselves blessed if they
               eat here only once. Mr. Liebrandt,
               kindly name one dish you ate the
               last time you were here.
                   (off his silence)
               Eleven times you take the boat out
               here, where we introduce every
               dish, every single time. We tell
               you exactly what we are feeding
               you. We create elaborate stories.
               We make it fun. We even give you a
               copy of the menu to take home.
               Please tell me one dish you ate the
               last time you were here. Or the
               time before. One. Please.

     Richard looks at Anne for help.

                         ANNE
                   (whispering)
               Cod.

                           RICHARD
               What?

                           ANNE
               Cod.

                         RICHARD
                   (to Chef)
               Cod.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               It wasn't cod, you donkey. It was
               halibut. Rare fucking spotted
               halibut.

                         ANNE
               What does it matter?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               It matters to the halibut, Mrs.
               Liebrandt. And to the artist whose
               work turns to shit inside your gut.

     Margot can't take this any longer. Some type of mask or
     willingness to "play the game" seems to be slipping.

                         MARGOT
               I have a question.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Yes, Margot from Nebraska.

                         TYLER
               I thought you were from Philly?

                         MARGOT
               Why do you deserve to die?

     Chef Slowik takes a deep breath and smiles.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Thank you. Key question. I've
               allowed my work to reach the price
               point where only the class of
               people in this room can access it.
               And I've been fooled into trying to
               please people who can never be
               pleased.
                   (pointing to Linda)
               Starting with her.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               But that's our culture, isn't it?
               And my restaurant is part of the
               problem. So it's time to die.

                         BRYCE
               It's not your restaurant.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Come again?

                         BRYCE
               You said it's your restaurant. But
               if we're all just being honest
               tonight, like you say, it's not.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You're right. He's right. Doug
               Verrick is my angel investor. He
               owns this island and this
               restaurant. And since Hawthorn's my
               entire life, Doug Verrick owns me.
               All of which is complicated by the
               fact that I currently own Doug
               Verrick.

     Chef looks to Elsa, who flips a SWITCH on the wall. Outside,
     spotlights reveal DOUG VERRICK, about 100 feet away,
     suspended by a contraption above the water with angel wings
     on his back.

                         BRYCE
               Ho-ly shit.

                          SOREN
               Okay, okay, seriously, how do we
               stop this?
                   (to Slowik)
               Just tell us how to stop this!

                         DAVE
               We have money! Obviously, we have
               money. Just tell us how much and
               we'll give it to you!

     Margot sees this is the wrong tactic.

                           MARGOT
               Shut up.

     Dave makes a sudden rush to the door but he is quickly bumped
     to the floor by a large SERVER. He splays out pathetically.

     Elsa steps forward.

               We appreciate your support. Your
               bill will be distributed at the end
               of the meal and all major credit

     Bryce stands up and YELLS like he owns the place.

                         BRYCE
               He kept you open through COVID, you
               prick! He did that!

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Yes he did. And he questioned my
               menu. He would even request
               substitutions, despite the fact
               that--
                   (screaming at the window)
               THERE ARE NO SUBSTITUTIONS AT
               HAWTHORN!!!

     Chef gestures to Elsa.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Fallen angel, please.

     Outside, the contraption slowly lowers Verrick into the bay.
     They can just barely make out his panicked screams.

     CAMERA creeps closer to Chef.

                         BRYCE
               You are a fucking maniac.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
               Shh.    Just listen.

                            SOREN
               This is --

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I said listen.

     They watch, pained, as Verrek is slowly lowered into the
     water, down, down, down, until finally he goes under.

                            CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               And...

     He waits for total, serene silence.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                   (a whisper)
               Quiet.

          Eyes closed, Chef listens a few more seconds. Nothing.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                    Do you hear that silence? Listen.
                    Can you hear it? That silence
                    means... I'm free.

          Close on MARGOT. She's horrified, but also struck by Chef's
          serenity. Tyler breaks the silence and leans into Margot.

                              TYLER
                    I'd say about three more savory
                    courses and then dessert. Maybe a
                    pre-dessert? What Chef would call a
                    transitional element.

          Margot is too numb to even hear him babbling. And then --
          BEEP BEEP! The kitchen timer.

                              ELSA
                    Time's up, Miss Mills. Chef will
                    speak with you now. In his office.

                              TYLER
                    May I speak to Chef as well?

                              ELSA
                    You may not.

          Elsa gestures to the back of the kitchen. Margot begins to
          walk in that direction, but Elsa stops her with her HAND.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    You will not ruin Chef's menu. Do
                    you understand me?

          Margot stares daggers at Elsa. She then lifts her hand, which
          is holding her napkin, and drops the napkin. Elsa of course
          scrambles to pick it up.

          Margot keeps walking.

          She is guided by two cooks toward a door that leads to Chef
          Slowik's office. She knocks. We hear Chef's voice.

                               CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    Come in.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You've made your decision.

                           MARGOT
               I have.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               And what have you decided?

                         MARGOT
               I - I've decided you're right. I
               shouldn't be here tonight. And I
               say this with respect because I'm
               sure you're quite brilliant but all
               of this - it wasn't meant for me.

     Chef looks disappointed at her attempt at flattery.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You're not sure I'm brilliant, so
               don't say it. It's tacky. False.

     Margot flinches.

                          MARGOT
               Fine then. I'm not sure you're
               brilliant.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
               Sloppy.

                           MARGOT
               Fuck you.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Sloppy girl. I was expecting more.
               I guess I have to make your
               decision for you: You belong here,
               with your own breed.

                         MARGOT
               What breed is that?

                          CHEF SLOWIK
               With the shit shovelers. Oh, you
               thought I couldn't tell? I know a
               fellow service industry worker when
               I see one.

     Beat.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)

     Margot doesn't answer.

                           CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                 You've been eyeing him all evening.

                           MARGOT
                 Well? I think you know.

     Chef Slowik nods.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
                 So, he paid for an experience. And
                 I can tell, from one provider of
                 experiences to another, that you
                 don't rattle easily. So how did he
                 rattle you.

                              MARGOT
                 It's not--

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                 Margot.

     A moment.

                           MARGOT
                 He told me to agree with everything
                 he said, and not break eye contact
                 while he jerked off.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
                 Uh huh. Specific.

                           MARGOT
                 Not really. It's pretty unoriginal.
                 What rattled me was that he told me
                 to tell him he was a good man, and
                 that I was his daughter and that I
                 loved him and then he--

     Chef cuts her off.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
                 So he's a romantic.

     They might share a little smirk. The smallest chuckle.

                           CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                 I don't need the details. I know
                 what a bad customer is.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    I used to. I haven't desired to
                    cook for someone in ages. And one

          Chef and Margot enter. Tension and dread hang in the air.
          Exhausted diners flinch as Chef walks near, like beaten dogs.

          Chef CLAPS, but the diners are too numb to respond.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Ladies and gentlemen, for our next

                    air.

          They all sit there. What is he talking about?

                              CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                    Come, come.

          Elsa is standing by the now open door to the outside. The
          escape hatch has been opened. But what awaits them outside?

          The diners are led out to a beautiful al fresco dining setup.
          The evening air is indeed beautiful, and a series of torches
          lend an almost primeval atmosphere to the proceedings.

          Tech Bros whisper as they gather around the dining setup.

               There might be a spare boat

                            DAVE
               What?

     Bryce seems somehow more reconciled to his fate than the
     others. Like he somehow accepts it.

                         BRYCE
               Get out of here to what?

                         SOREN
               What are you talking about?

                            BRYCE
               Forget it.

     LILLIAN AND TED. Lillian stares up at the stars.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               We're going to die tonight, Ted.

                            TED
               Alrighty.

     Silence. Chef Slowik CLAPS and everyone comes to attention.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Ladies and gentlemen, our next
               course will be presented by sous
               chef Katherine Keller.

     KATHERINE steps out of the darkness. She smiles amidst the
     exquisite silence, her face lit by torchlight.

                         KATHERINE
               Good evening, everyone. I have a
               story for you all. Three years ago,
               Julian Slowik tried to fuck me.

     Chef Slowik nods slightly but remains impassive. Elsa looks
     longingly at chef.

                         KATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I refused his advances. A week
               later, he tried again. And again, I
               refused. But he didn't fire me.

                         KATHERINE (CONT'D)
               "That would be unethical," he
               thought. So he kept me in his
               kitchen and refused to look me in
               the eye or speak directly to me for
               eight months. He can do that.
               Because he's the star. He's the
               man.

     Chef Slowik looks away, a bit pained.

                          KATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Which mean he gets to be the dark
               romantic genius who suffers for his
               art. A woman chef is a trooper. A
               go-getter. She's a mother hen. She
               makes grandma's recipes with a sly
               modern twist.
                   (beat)
               Isn't that right?

     Diners shift uncomfortably. But LILLIAN BLOOM nods.

                         KATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I have been groped, I have been
               leered at, I have earned more but
               made less, and all of it in the
               service of men so enraptured with
               themselves that they don't see
               their own pointlessness. So let's
               help them see.
                   (sincerely warm)
               Our next course is called "Man's
               Folly."

     Katherine approaches Chef and stands very close, looking him
     right in the eyes. She pulls a small PAIR OF SCISSORS from
     her apron and stabs him in the thigh. He accepts it with a
     wince and a nod.

     Katherine and Chef Slowik share a long, meaningful hug.
     Theirs is a deep understanding that we'll never know.

                          CHEF SLOWIK
                   (a whisper)
               I'm sorry.

     Katherine smiles at him. He smiles back and pulls the knife
     from his thigh. A SERVER is there with a tray with a little
     flower on it to take it away. For the rest of the movie, Chef
     will have a growing bloodstain on his pants and a limp.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               To our male diners. We now offer
               you the chance to escape.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               You will be given a 45 second head
               start, at which point members of my
               staff will try and catch you. If
               they do catch you...

     SOREN immediately makes a break for it and doesn't wait for
     the chef to finish his statement.

                          CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Okay.

     At this point all the other male diners make a break for it
     too. Before Richard leaves...

                         RICHARD
                   (to Anne)
               I'll send for help. First thing.

     And Richard's near 70-year old body approximates a run.

     Before MOVIE STAR leaves, to Felicity...

                          MOVIE STAR
               Yeah, sorry. Obviously, you know -
               I'm awful?

     And he also kinda runs out of there.

     Tyler doesn't move. He wants to stay.

                          CHEF SLOWIK
               You too.

     Tyler reluctantly nods and then walks off, slowly.

     Chef turns to the remaining women.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I'll leave you to it.

     Chef exits. The female diners are left alone. Frighteningly
     alone. What will be done to them?

                          KATHERINE
                   (warm)
               Care to join me inside? It's
               getting chilly.

     The female diners enter and there is one table, small, round
     and intimate, with six place settings.

     Lillian, Anne, Margot, Felicity, and Linda take their seats.
     And then Katherine sits, and smiles warmly at them.

37        EXT. GREAT LAWN. EVENING                                     37

          Random shots of the men running wildly for their lives. Dave
          runs with Soren.

                              SOREN
                    Don't run near me dude. Get the
                    fuck away from me!


38        INT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM. EVENING              38

          On the women. It's tense. They're waiting for the other shoe
          to drop. And yet, there is undeniably a warmer energy in the
          room now that Chef Slowik and the other men are gone.
          Beautiful plates of food are set in front of them.

          A TITLE reads: "SEVENTH COURSE: `MAN'S FOLLY' - Dungeness
          crab, fermented yogurt whey, dried sea lettuce, umeboshi,
          kelp."

          Silence. Someone has to say something.

                              ANNE
                    So. How's everyone's night?

          They lightly laugh. But scared, jittery laughs.

                              FELICITY
                    Yeah. Terrific.

          Lillian takes a bite. Katherine eyes her as she does so.
          Lillian sighs. But a sigh of deep respect. She turns to
          Katherine with an almost apologetic look.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM
                    Well. I have to say it's fabulous.
                    The tartness of the umeboshi. Waves
                    of ferment. Rich yet clean.

                              KATHERINE
                    Yes, well... There was a time that
                    would have meant a lot to me.

          Katherine looks away coolly. But it's clear the compliment
          from the great Lillian Bloom still does mean something.

          They continue eating. Until suddenly Katherine begins to
          softly weep. The women diners look at each other awkwardly.
          Are they supposed to... comfort their captor?

          Not knowing what else to do, they eat.


39        EXT. THE WOODS. EVENING                                   39

          A SHOT of Ted running. It's a pretty dainty run. One of the
          sous chefs appears on the horizon and Ted turns and sees him
          giving chase. Ted screams. He looks pathetic.

          In a nearby clearing, the movie star is running. He hears a
          pop in his hamstring and comes up lame.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    AHHH!! I heard a pop.

          And then he gets tackled by a sous chef.


40        INT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM. EVENING           40

          The women eat. Katherine wipes the last tears from her eyes,
          revived.

                              KATHERINE
                    Oh, I almost forgot. Bread.

          They look at each other surprised.

                              KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Did you actually think we would not
                    serve our famous bread, on this the
                    night of our final menu?

          She glances up at the servers and they bring bread.

          Margot takes a quick glance at the hallway leading to the
          exit. And then she shifts her eyes to see Katherine looking
          dead at her. Katherine silently shakes her head as if to say,
          "No chance." Margot smiles.

                              MARGOT
                    Is there butter?

                              KATHERINE
                    Not necessary. Eat.

          They all take a bite of bread. As scared as they are, their
          faces can't hide just how shockingly good the bread is.

                              FELICITY
                    Jesus fucking Christ...

          Some dazed nods from the table. A strange feeling: doomed
          captives nevertheless enjoying a moment of deliciousness.
          Despite everything, for the first time it almost feels like
          real people eating dinner together.

          Elsa watches them, with maybe the slightest trace of longing.

          We see at one of the windows, Tyler is staring in longingly
          as well, wishing he were inside, not even trying to escape.


41        EXT. COASTLINE. EVENING                                   41

          Soren has managed to locate a rowboat stashed on the far side
          of the island. He pushes it frantically across the pebble
          beach to the water.


42        INT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM. EVENING           42

          They eat bread and drink wine. The tension and dread is still
          there, but it has oddly settled into a kind of dazed warmth.

          Margot can feel Anne's eyes on her. It's a bit uncomfortable.

                              FELICITY
                    So, you can tell us... are we
                    really going to die?

          Katherine nods.

                              FELICITY (CONT'D)
                    It's just...I'm supposed to start a
                    new job Monday. At Sony. Associate
                    Development Co-Exec.

          Katherine just stares at Felicity. And then...

                              KATHERINE
                    It doesn't work if you live.

                              ANNE
                    What doesn't work?

                                KATHERINE
                    The menu.

                                FELICITY
                    Why not?

                              KATHERINE
                    It needs an ending that ties things
                    together conceptually. Otherwise it
                    just... tastes good. And who cares.

          ON MARGOT, who clocks this answer.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM
                    You should have your own place.

          Katherine says nothing. Lillian's wheels turn.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM (CONT'D)
                    I could help with that of course?

          Katherine looks at her.

                              KATHERINE
                    I'm sure you could, Ms. Bloom.

                              LILLIAN BLOOM
                    Of course we'd have to see about
                    the whole - dying thing?

                              KATHERINE
                    Oh everyone dying was my pitch
                    actually. I'm super proud of it.

          Katherine smiles. She's as crazy as Chef. Or crazier.


43        EXT. COASTLINE. EVENING                                      43

          Soren pushes the rowboat into the water. He clambers in just
          as he sees TWO COOKS running up the beach in the distance.

          He only has one oar in the boat. He tries frantically to row,
          switching left and right.

          The cooks are now in the water, swimming after. They can swim
          faster than Soren can row. Within seconds they have caught up
          to him. One of the cooks begins to climb aboard. Soren hits
          him with the oar a few times, but he can't be stopped. The
          cook grabs the oar and pulls Soren into the water.


44        EXT. FARM/GARDENS. EVENING                                   44

          A fenced-in chicken coop next to the greenhouse.

          Richard, having been caught, is being dragged by the cooks
          back to the restaurant.

45        INT. CHICKEN COOP. EVENING                                   45

          Bryce has hidden himself inside the darkened chicken coop.
          Nesting hens sleep. Not a bad hiding spot, actually.

          He sees a HAND enter the coop door holding a plate with an
          egg elegantly presented in a cup. A SERVER peeks his head in.

                              SERVER #2
                    A special bite for the last guest
                    to be caught. A little play on the
                    Passard egg with creme fraiche and
                    maple.

          Bryce sighs. They've truly thought of everything.


46        INT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM. EVENING              46

          They eat. Little side conversations around the room. A sense
          of warmth in all this madness. Some of the other female staff
          have joined. Everyone but Elsa.

          Anne continues to stare at Margot, here it comes:

                              ANNE
                    So, Margot, you know my husband
                    then?

          It all stops. That cuts through everything. Margot looks at
          Anne, whose eyes are on her. Margot considers lying. But why?

                              MARGOT
                    Yeah.

          Anne smiles sadly and nods.

                              ANNE
                    Right.

          Maybe the hint of a tear in Anne's eye. She looks away.

          After a beat, Lillian jumps in to break the tension:

                               LILLIAN BLOOM
                    I miss smoking in restaurants. One
                    of life's simple pleasures taken
                    away-but I think tonights
                    circumstances call for an
                    exception?

          A beat. Katherine nods.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM (CONT'D)
               Anyone have a cigarette?

     A few smiles. Margot hands Lillian a cigarette. Lillian
     lights it on her table candle. The mood is restored.

     Margot takes a bite of bread. She feels a comfort. She looks
     at the women, then:

                         MARGOT
               My name's Erin. I'm from Brockton,
               Massachusetts.

     At this moment, the male diners are brought back into the
     restaurant. Some are bleeding. They look exhausted. Some are
     crying. They look just pathetic.

                         KATHERINE
                   (to the women)
               Party's over.

     Bryce, busted nose, notices the basket of bread.

                         BRYCE
               You got bread? This is so fucking
               reverse sexist.

     Soren, soaking wet, enters and sits down. Utterly defeated.

     Tyler sees the food at the table where the women were
     sitting. An entire course he didn't get to try. And bread?!?
     He rushes to the table and starts shoveling food in his
     mouth.

     Richard sees Ann and Margot together. It's clear they talked.

                         RICHARD
               Shit.

     MOVIE STAR AND FELICITY. He looks haunted. She notices.

                         FELICITY
               How'd ya do out there?

                         MOVIE STAR
               Oh, wonderful. I got away.

     Felicity smiles sadly.

                         MOVIE STAR (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry I'm a failure.

                         FELICITY
               It's all right.
                   (then, sudden honesty)
               I've been stealing money from you.

                            MOVIE STAR
               I know.

                         FELICITY
               I know you know.

     Chef enters. He sees Tyler stuffing his face. Sheer contempt.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Folks, I'm afraid our menu cannot
               continue as planned until we deal
               with an unresolved matter.
                   (To Tyler)
               You.

     Tyler, mouth full, looks around. His hero is talking to him.

                            TYLER
               M-me?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Tell me why you're here.

                            TYLER
               Why I'm--?

                            CHEF SLOWIK
               Here.

                         TYLER
               Because I-- I wanted...

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Swallow first.

     Tyler finishes.

                         TYLER
               To experience your food. Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               And what were you told?

     Tyler glances at Margot.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Don't look at her. What were you
               told ahead of time?
46                    PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)       82.


     Tyler hesitate for a moment.

                         TYLER
               I was told tonight would be the
               greatest menu ever created.

                            CHEF SLOWIK
               And?

                         TYLER
               And - that everyone would die.

     It dawns on MARGOT what he's saying. He knew. He always knew.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You had a date. Not the young woman
               here tonight. What happened to her?

                         TYLER
               She broke up with me, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               And so you brought Margot. Why?

     Tyler hesitates. But Chef leans down, inches away from Tyler.

                         TYLER
               Be-- Because you don't offer
               seatings f-for one.

     ANGLE ON Margot. Her eyes are filled with malice.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You hired her knowing she'd die.

                            TYLER
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               But thinking you wouldn't.

                            TYLER
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Are you sorry about this?

                            TYLER
               No, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Would you like to change your mind?
46                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          83.


                           TYLER
               No, Chef.

                           CHEF SLOWIK
               Why not?

                         TYLER
               I want to experience the menu.

     Chef Slowik stands up straight again. He towers over Tyler.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               For the 8 months I've corresponded
               with you. I gave you access to our
               world. I swore you to secrecy. Why
               do you think I would do this? Why
               do you think I wanted you here?

                         TYLER
               Because - I know a lot about food?

     Chef Slowik places a gentle hand on Tyler's shoulder.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You're not like the others, are
               you? You knew what a Pacojet is.
               The bergamot. You're a cook. And
               cooks belong in the kitchen.

     Tyler looks to the STAFF assembled behind Chef. They smile
     warmly and nod. Elsa approaches with folded CHEF'S WHITES.

                           TYLER
               Chef?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Go on. They're for you.

     Tyler stands and hesitantly dons the whites and apron. A
     server places little tweezers and a meat thermometer in
     Tyler's sleeve pocket. The word "Hawthorn" is embroidered on
     his breast. Underneath, Chef, in Sharpie, writes "Tyler."

     Tyler looks at Chef. He can't help feeling a little proud.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               You look wonderful. Doesn't he look
               wonderful, Margot?

                         LINDA
               Mr. Handsome Boy!

     Tyler doesn't quite know what to say.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                    Now cook.

                                 TYLER
                    What?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Cook. You're a cook, so cook.

                              TYLER
                    What do you mean, cook here? Me?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    COOK COOK COOK! GO ON NOW, COOK!

          Chef starts shooing him into --


47        INT. THE KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS                                 47

          -- Chef takes Tyler by the shoulders and positions him in
          front of the burners as everyone watches. Tyler shakes.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    What do you need? We have
                    everything. Just tell me what you
                    need for your dish.

                                 TYLER
                    L-leeks?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Get the cook some leeks!

                                 SOUS-CHEFS
                    Yes, Chef!

          Someone hands Tyler two leeks. Tyler's hands shake as he
          takes a knife and finds a nearby cutting board.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                    What else?

                               TYLER
                    Um.   Sh-sh-sh-

                               CHEF SLOWIK
                    Shit?   Would you like some shit?

                                 TYLER
                    Shallots.
47                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          85.


                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Shallots for the great foodie! The
               Phenomenal Mr. Food himself!

     Someone hands Tyler shallots. He's so flustered he can only
     cut haphazard chunks. Margot watches from the dining room.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Everyone pay close attention. We
               must learn from Tyler. This is a
               new dicing method of which we have
               been woefully ignorant. What next?

                           TYLER
               B-butter?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Butter! Leeks and shallots sautï¿½d
               in butter! I bear witness to a
               revolution in cuisine!

     Tyler nervously dumps all the food into a pan. Someone hands
     him a piece of lamb, which he numbly adds to the pan. They
     hand him a spatula. Completely out of body, he stirs.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Is it done? Or would you like to
               jam it into the Pacojet?
                   (Tyler shakes his head)
               Then plate it.

     Someone produces a plate, and Tyler basically just dumps the
     food onto it. He tries to arrange it in some artful way, but
     his hands tremble, and it's just terrible.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Shall I taste it?

     Tyler can't even respond. He's crying.

     Chef takes a spoonful of Tyler's food and lifts it to his
     mouth. Just as he's about to try it --

                     AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                           SUPPLEMENTAL COURSE

     CLOSE on Tyler's hideous plate. A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads,
     "TYLER'S BULLSHIT. Under-cooked lamb, inedible shallot-leek
     butter sauce, utter lack of cohesion."

     Chef Slowik takes a bite. He looks surprised. And delighted.
     He looks to be savoring it. Tyler watches through tears.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Mmm. Wow. Mmm. I have to say...
               it's actually quite bad.

     And then he spits his food out onto a napkin.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               You are why the mystery has been
               drained from our art. You see that
               now, don't you?

                            TYLER
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Come here, son.

     Chef begins whispering into Tyler's ear. We don't hear it.
     But Tyler nods along as he whispers. When chef is done, he
     looks at Tyler, warmly smiles, and waits for an answer.

                            TYLER
               Yes, Chef.

     Tyler removes his chef whites, hands them to Elsa, and exits
     in the direction of Chef's office.

     Chef Slowik turns to Margot with a serene look.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               And now you're free too.

     Chef Slowik turns to his diners with a remorseful expression.

                          CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I want to apologize to you all.
               What you just saw was not
               originally part of tonight's menu.
               We were presented with a problem
               and were forced to adjust as best
               we could. We strive for perfection,
               but there is no such thing. That is
               a hard truth for me to accept.
                   (beat)
               Please forgive me.

     He hangs his head low and walks back toward the kitchen. As
     he passes Margot, he mutters to her:

                            CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Follow me.

48        INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                    48

          Chef leads Margot into the pastry area, where the PASTRY
          CHEFS, faces dotted with flour, ply their craft.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    We have only one more savory course
                    left in our menu. That means we
                    must prepare for dessert.

          Margot has no idea what to do with this information. And
          she's still shaky from what just transpired.

                                MARGOT
                    Okay?

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Dessert requires a large--

                                MARGOT
                    Chef?

                                CHEF SLOWIK
                    Yes?

          Pause...she's coming up with something.

                              MARGOT
                    I'm sorry you're at the end.

          Chef turns and looks at her.

                              MARGOT (CONT'D)
                    You've reached the end, right?
                        (to the staff)
                    Everyone here reached the end?
                    You're tired?
                        (back to chef)
                    I'm tired too. I'm exhausted.
                    Everyone exhausts me... But I'm not
                    at the end. I'm the only one here
                    who isn't. If anyone can see that,
                    it's you. Or maybe you can't, I
                    don't know. Maybe you're so far
                    gone that you can't even tell
                    what's real anymore.

          Chef is listening.

                              MARGOT (CONT'D)
                    But I do not deserve to die
                    tonight. I know how to be alive. I
                    like life. And I happen to be
                    excited for what's next in mine.
48                    PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)       88.


     Pause. She looks at Chef and Chef back at her.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               This didn't work did it.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               No, but a marginally better
               attempt. I do appreciate that. May
               I continue?

     Margot truly looks defeated. She's met her match and lost.

                           MARGOT
               Sure.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Dessert requires a large barrel
               that is supposed to be there, in
               the corner. Do you see a barrel?

                         MARGOT
                   (weary of the charade)
               No. No, I do not see a barrel.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Neither do I. That is because my
               negligent employee Elsa forgot to
               assign someone to bring it.

     Elsa, always somehow nearby, is gutted by her error.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               You will fetch the barrel instead.

                           MARGOT
               Me?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You remember the smokehouse?

                         MARGOT
               I - think so?

                         ELSA
               Chef, perhaps one of us should --

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Margot is now one of us, Elsa.
               Right, Margot?

     On Margot who looks stone-faced.

                           MARGOT
               Yes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                    Yes, what?

                                 MARGOT
                    Yes, Chef.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Give her the smokehouse key.

                                 ELSA
                    Yes, Chef.

          Elsa slides a KEY off of her key ring and, against her better
          judgment, hands it to Margot.

          Margot looks at Chef, and leaves. On her way out of the
          restaurant, she walks past Chef's office. The door is
          slightly ajar, and she can see through the crack in the door
          Tyler's LEGS DANGLING OVER CHEF'S DESK. He's hanged himself.

          She's initially shocked, but then, a hint of a smile.


49        EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - NIGHT                                 49

          A clear, beautiful evening, lit by moonlight. Calls of
          insects and night birds. Margot walks across the lawn. She's
          actually going through with this. She moves with purpose,
          strength, conviction.

          Up ahead looms a patch of WOODS.


50        EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER                                   50

          Margot enters the dark forest along a path leading to the
          small SMOKEHOUSE lit by a single, dim porch light.

          As she walks, she hears a rustling sound in the woods and a
          distant SNAP. She stops and turns to listen. Nothing. Then
          she looks down at the KEY in her hand.


51        INT. SMOKEHOUSE - NIGHT                                      51

          Margot enters and flips on the overhead light. Sure enough,
          there's the BARREL resting beneath hanging trout.

          She approaches the barrel as if to retrieve it. But instead
          she reaches behind it, where a SCALING KNIFE hangs by a nail.

          Taking the knife, she glances out a small window and spots
          Chef Slowik's COTTAGE bathed in moonlight.

52        INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                52

          While Felicity stares off, exhausted, the movie star gazes at
          her with a look of deep regret. Then he looks away and nods.

          The room is silent. Chef Slowik enters and is about to clap
          when, scared but brave, the movie star rises to his feet.

                              MOVIE STAR
                    Excuse me, Mr. Slowik. Chef.

          Chef turns to him. The famous actor has summoned all of his
          talent and experience for this crucial moment. But the way
          Chef makes eye contact immediately throws him.

                              MOVIE STAR (CONT'D)
                        (stumbling through)
                    Um, yes, hi. How are you? Or --
                    well, I just, wanted to say,
                    because - and I'm not trying to
                    sound all, whatever here or
                    anything, but it's just - I just -
                    I don't think it's really, totally
                    fair, maybe, what's happening here?
                    So - ? But, yeah.
                        (quick, panicked breath)
                    My point is, we're all people, you
                    know? And people are people -
                    obviously - and if the people of,
                    you know, of the world, I guess,
                    could all see each other as people,
                    then maybe - you see what I'm
                    saying? It's like - divisions.
                    There are just such, we have so
                    many divisions, nowadays, I think?
                    Um, and it's so... But it's like,
                    fuck, don't kill people, you know?
                    I know that sounds totally, `Yeah,
                    no shit' - but also, like? I do
                    think we should all just - you
                    know? That's how I feel. At least.
                    Anyway. Just, please don't kill
                    Felicity, okay? I mean, that would
                    be, just - come on, don't do that.
                    And... yeah.

          He quickly sits down.

          Chef Slowik takes all of this in and nods subtly.

                              CHEF SLOWIK
                    Not quite off-book with that
                    speech, were you?
52                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          91.


                           MOVIE STAR
               No, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You really have lost it, haven't
               you?

                         MOVIE STAR
                   (almost relieved to hear)
               Yes. Big time.

     Felicity looks at the movie star. She smiles sympathetically.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Do you wish to know why you are
               being punished?

                           MOVIE STAR
               Sure.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I saw the film Calling Dr.
               Sunshine, and I did not enjoy it.

                           MOVIE STAR
               Sorry?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               It was a Sunday. My one day off in
               months. The most precious day. The
               day where I was allowed to live.
               And I saw the film Calling Dr.
               Sunshine alone in the cinema.

                         MOVIE STAR
               I didn't, you know, direct the
               film. I just acted in it.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               The memory of your face in that
               film -- and seeing you again now --
               haunts me, drives me. What becomes
               of an artist when he loses his
               purpose.

     The movie star looks at Chef, who stares at him. It's futile.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Right.
                   (pointing to Felicity)
               And her?
      52                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          92.


                               CHEF SLOWIK
                         (to Felicity)
                     What school did you go to?

                                  FELICITY
                     Um, Brown?

                               CHEF SLOWIK
                     Student loans?

                                  FELICITY
                     No...

                               CHEF SLOWIK
                     Sorry. You're dying.

           Chef turns and walks back into the kitchen. It's not fair.
           But the movie star sits down, resigned to his fate.


52A        EXT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE                                 52A

           Margot stands outside the front door.


53         INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS                      53

           Margot enters and looks around. The interior is an exact
           REPLICA of the interior of the restaurant.

                               MARGOT
                     Motherfucker.

           In the middle of the dining room sits a COT. Next to the cot
           is a small table with lamp and a Bible. This is apparently
           where Chef sleeps.

           It's so quiet here, so clean. Pristine.

           For reasons she doesn't know, she takes her same seat from
           the restaurant, closes her eyes, and breathes in the
           tranquility. It is quiet and still.


54         INT. HAWTHORN DINING ROOM--CONTINUOUS                        54

           HARD CUT back to the real dining room. Not quiet. People
           screaming. Felicity is being forced to feed the movie star
           nuts, which he is allergic to. It's clear he is having a
           massive allergic reaction.

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE READS: "EIGHTH COURSE: `GONE NUTS' -
           peanut dashi, peanut foam, peanut curd, peanut brittle, and
           raw peanuts hand-fed"

          We see as well that Lillian is being waterboarded in a giant
          pail of the emulsion.


55        INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS                      55

          Silence. Margot continues to sit. And then she starts to
          breathe heavily, fighting tears. It's as if she is now
          processing everything that has brought her to this point.

                               MARGOT
                    Stop it.

          Then Margot realizes something. She gets up, leaving the
          scaling knife on the table.

          Sure enough, she finds an exact replica of the SILVER DOOR
          she glimpsed earlier. She tries to open it, but it's locked.

          She hears the front door open. We see the footfalls of the
          person stepping inside the cottage. CAMERA rises to reveal --

                              ELSA
                    I told you when you arrived that
                    nobody enters Chef's home. And you
                    have disobeyed this rule.

          Elsa sees the scaling knife on the table and smiles.

          Margot enters the dining room, ready for a confrontation, and
          sees Elsa holding the knife.

                              ELSA (CONT'D)
                    I worry about the customers so Chef
                    can worry about the menu. And you
                    have made my job very difficult.

          Elsa takes a step toward Margot, who braces for whatever
          attack Elsa might unleash.

                              MARGOT
                    Why would you die for him?

          Elsa is shaking now. Almost breaking down.

                              ELSA
                    You will not replace me.                                *

          Elsa lunges at Margot, swiping with the knife. Margot dodges
          backwards. She turns and runs, pursued by Elsa, into...
     55                      Goldenrod Rev. (10/29/21)            94.


          THE KITCHEN

          Margot scans the room for a knife, a weapon, anything. But
          Elsa's already there, trapping Margot in the kitchen.

          Margot starts grabbing whatever she can find -- ladels,
          bowls, sheet pans -- and throws them at Elsa, as Elsa pursues
          her around the kitchen island. But Elsa keeps coming at her.

          Margot finds a blender-sized kitchen appliance and heaves it
          as hard as she can at Elsa, who tries to deflect it, but it
          slams against the side of her head, hard. Elsa reels.

          The appliance crashes to the ground, and we see the label in
          CLOSE-UP: "PACOJET."

          Margot tackles Elsa and manages to get on top of her. She
          wrestles away the knife. Elsa is beat. She knows it. Suddenly     *
          all of her fight is gone. A strange, sad look of realization:     *

                              ELSA (CONT'D)                                 *
                    He never told me...                                     *

                               MARGOT                                       *
                    What-?                                                  *

                              ELSA                                          *
                    About a barrel... He thought he                         *
                    told me... But he didn't... It                          *
                    wasn't me who forgot...                                 *
                        (acceptance)                                        *
                    It was him.                                             *

          Elsa admits a long denied truth: She's given her life and all     *
          of her talents to a man whose talents have slipped.               *

          Elsa suddenly grabs Margot's wrist. With her usual impeccable     *
          service, she helps Margot guide the knife down into her own       *
          throat. Elsa dies.                                                *

          Margot then takes the key ring from Elsa's pocket and returns
          to the silver door.


56        INT. THE SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS                            56

          Margot enters. A lovely room. A private haven. Warmly lit and
          beautiful. An actual life. A desk. Leather chair. Stacks of
          recipe books.

          AND FRAMED PHOTOS all along the wall. We might see glimpses
          of a few. They seem to be from different points in his life:
          A preppy, affluent YOUNG SLOWIK in a school uniform. A photo
          of Slowik, his mom, and a meek looking man.
56                       Goldenrod Rev. (10/29/21)              94A.


     They look quite normal. What appears to be a family photo of
     Slowik with a beautiful woman and a young girl. A vigorous,
     focused Slowik opening his first restaurant, Tantalus in New
     York. Finally, SLOWIK OPENING HAWTHORN, standing with Doug
     Verrick. Slowik looks drained by this point, the humanity
     drained from his face. But in NONE OF THE PHOTOS is he
     smiling.

     But   Margot's attention is on one framed photo   in particular.
     She   walks closer and closer to the photo, and   then takes it
     off   the wall and gazes at it for a long beat.   We never see
     the   photo she sees, but it touches a nerve in   Margot.

          Then Margot notices a RADIO on a shelf. She dashes towards it
          and fiddles with the transceiver.

                              MARGOT
                    Hello? Is anyone there? Can anyone
                    hear this? Hello! Can anyone hear
                    this? CAN ANYONE FUCKING HEAR ME?

                              VOICE
                        (crackly)
                    Come in?

                              MARGOT
                    Hello? Who is this?

                              VOICE
                    Coast Guard. Who am I talking to?

                              MARGOT
                    Oh, thank Christ. I'm at the
                    restaurant. The... Hawthorn.
                    Hawthorn! People are getting
                    murdered. Send help. Send help!

                              VOICE
                    What did you say?

                              MARGOT
                    Just get here! Now! PLEASE!
                    Hawthorn Island! People are dying.
                    It's an emergency!

                              VOICE
                    Okay, just, uh -- don't move!


57        INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                         57

          Margot staggers back out into the "dining room" and retakes
          her seat. Silence.

          A sudden, startling CLAP from an INTERCOM speaker.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    Do you like my home?

          Margot makes a face like, "Of course this isn't over."

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    People always say you shouldn't
                    take your work home with you. I
                    disagree. Go ahead, speak.
     57                      Yellow Rev. (10/07/21)               96.


                              MARGOT
                    Elsa's dead.

          We hear a small, resigned sigh from Slowik.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    It's what she wanted. It's what I
                    want, too. Death is nothing. I'm a
                    chef, I work with death every day.
                    Death is my business. How can I
                    call myself a chef if I don't
                    experience death for myself?

          Margot thinks about this for a beat.

                              MARGOT
                    Your self-pity doesn't track. Why
                    not go run a soup kitchen? Or a
                    monastery? Or go back to your
                    little taco truck? Come to think of
                    it, why did you park a taco truck
                    next to a convention you knew was
                    swarming with food critics?

          Beat. No answer.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    Why do we do the things we do.
                    What's your excuse?

                              MARGOT
                    I like beating men like you.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    There is no man like me.

                              MARGOT
                    That's the dumbest fucking thing
                    you've said all night.

          We hear Chef Slowik LAUGH softly and knowingly.

                              CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                    Fetch the barrel. Our customers are
                    waiting.


58        INT. HAWTHORN DINING AREA AND KITCHEN                     58

          We PAN ACROSS the dining room. Panic, exhaustion.

          Chef Slowik carries a birthday cake loaded with candles over
          to Bryce.
58                      Yellow Rev. (10/07/21)              96A.


     He is singing `Happy Birthday.' The entire kitchen staff
     follows him into the dining room, singing along. Some guests
     might numbly sing along too.

                         BRYCE
               You told them it was my birthday?

                         SOREN
                   (shrugs)
               It seemed funny three hours ago.

     Chef Slowik sets the cake in front of Bryce and touches his
     shoulder meaningfully.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Happy Birthday

                         BRYCE
                   (weirdly touched)
               Thanks.

     A sweaty Margot enters the restaurant, rolling the barrel in
     front of her. The diners look at her hopefully.
58                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          97.


                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Leave it there. And take your seat.

     Margot sits at her table, which has been cleaned and
     perfectly re-set. Chef Slowik walks over.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I thought about your question.
               Here is the answer. I am a monster.
               No, was a monster. And a whore.
               But tonight everything I'm doing is
               pure. Egoless. And at last, the
               pain is almost gone.

     There's a CANDLE on Margot's table. Chef Slowik extends his
     hand directly over it. The flame burns his flesh, but he
     doesn't so much as flinch.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Chef's Hands. "Asbestos hands." I
               can carry a cast-iron from a hot
               oven to your table with no
               protection. That's a cook's
               training.

     He snuffs the candle with his thumb and forefinger.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I can no longer be hurt, Margot.
               As Dr. King said, "We know through
               painful experience that freedom is
               never voluntarily given by the
               oppressor. It must be demanded by
               the oppressed."

                         MOVIE STAR
               Did he just quote Martin Luther
               King?

     Outside the windows, a LIGHT appears on the water. A small
     BOAT. Margot sees it out of the corner of her eye.

     Chef Slowik spots it, too, for a moment frozen with
     indecision, perhaps even fear.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               So you found our radio.
                   (to the kitchen)
               Clear the dining room. Immediately!

     Servers appear from everywhere to get people seated again,
     wipe down the floor, their work hyper-fast.
58                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)            98.


     One server applies a white bandage to Chef's hand and ties a
     new apron around his waist to mask his blood-soaked pants.
     The movie star is given a fast-acting anti-allergy syringe.

     Margot looks out the window to see a lone COAST GUARD OFFICER
     stepping onto the dock. No back-up. Not good.

                         MARGOT
                   (quietly)
               No no no.

     Chef Slowik sees what Margot sees. He smiles just a little.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You will be tempted to ask him for
               help. To plead, even. This would be
               unwise. He cannot help you.

     The guests look unconvinced and exchange conspiratorial
     glances. How can they let this opportunity pass?

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               I see you don't believe me. You
               think this might be your only
               chance. But ask yourselves two
               questions: One, if you really want
               to be responsible for the death of
               an innocent man. And two, ask
               yourselves -- this entire evening,
               why didn't you all try harder to
               fight back? To get out of here?
               Honestly, you probably could have.

     The patrons look around. He's right. Why didn't they?

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Anyway, something to think about.

     A knock. Chef Slowik nods at a server to unlock the door.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Good evening. How can we help you?

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
                   (stepping inside)
               I got a report of a disturbance.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Here? What kind of disturbance.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               A violent one. In fact, I don't
               want to alarm you folks, but there
               was a report of a possible murder.
58                    PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)       99.


     We cut to the diners' quietly panicked faces. Chef Slowik
     laughs, and one by one the whole staff joins in, laughing as
     well. The diners play along wearily with forced smiles.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               No, officer. Nothing of that sort.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Are you the owner?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Ownership changed hands recently,
               but that's another story. I am the
               executive chef. I don't wish to be
               rude, but, as you can see, we are
               right in the middle of service.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Oh. Are these your only guests?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Tonight is a private event. We're
               peer-testing a new concept menu.

     Not quite understanding what that means, the officer looks
     around at the diners. They seem composed enough.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Did anybody here call in a distress
               on the short-wave tonight?

     All shake their heads, except for Margot.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               We are not in the habit of serving
               our guests short-wave radios with
               their meals.

     The cooks laugh again. Maybe a little too loud.

     The Coast Guard Officer notices the movie star, who looks a
     little worse for wear, but better than before. A glimmer of
     recognition passes across the officer's face.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Hey, are you --?

                           MOVIE STAR
               Yes.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Oh, wow. I'm a big fan.

                            MOVIE STAR
               Thank you.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Would you like his autograph?

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Well, I don't want to bother you.

                         MOVIE STAR
               No bother at all.

     The officer walks over to the movie star. A server arrives
     with a pen and paper on a tray.

                         MOVIE STAR (CONT'D)
               What's your name?

                            COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Dale.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Dale. Hello, Dale.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               You're great. My wife and I loved
               that, uh... what's it called? The
               one where you're the surgeon?

                         MOVIE STAR
               Calling Dr. Sunshine.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Yeah. Great stuff.

     The movie star smiles sadly and hands over the autograph.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Thank you. You're very kind.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Okay. Well, sorry again to bother
               you folks. I'll be going now.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Thank you for your service.

     The officer turns and walks back toward the door. As he does,
     he looks down at the AUTOGRAPH. It reads "HELP US."

     The officer turns, whips out his gun, and points it at Chef.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Hands above your head! Now!
58                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)           101.


                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Are you joking?

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               I am not joking, sir!

     A cook behind Chef Slowik steps forward to protect his
     master, but Chef holds up a hand.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Clearly there's a misunderstanding.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Get down on your knees with your
               hands up. Now!

     Chef Slowik draws a long breath and complies.

                         ANNE
               Help us! He wants to kill us all!

     Others diners chime in as well.

                         COAST GUARD OFFICER
               Nobody move till I say so!

     The officer inches forward. When he has almost reached Chef,
     he pivots toward Margot's table, gun still pointed, and pulls
     the trigger. A SMALL FLAME emits from the barrel, and he
     lights the extinguished candle on Margot's table.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Oh, fuck me.

     The officer holsters the gun, puts on an apron, and joins his
     comrades by the kitchen.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Thank you, Dale.
                   (to Margot)
               In a kitchen we all work together
               or nothing works at all. You have
               betrayed our sacred bond of trust.
               And you've shown your craft to be
               careless. I was wrong. You're an
               eater. A taker. An animal like all
               the rest.

     We scan the faces of the cooks and servers behind Chef
     Slowik. He's right. She has failed the test. She has not
     lived up to the rigors and standards of Hawthorn.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Final course plating in five!

                            ENTIRE KITCHEN
               Yes, Chef!

     Two cooks tip the barrel on its side. A VISCOUS LIQUID pours
     out across the floor. What is it -- chocolate? Rendered fat?

     Resigned to their fate, the diners don't even bother lifting
     their feet. By now some even feel as if they deserve it.

     Margot's head droops. All is lost. But she doesn't look
     scared. Or sad. Instead, a kind of quiet, simmering anger
     builds inside her, something that wants to burst out.

                         MARGOT
                   (barely audible)
               I don't like your food.

     Servers have begun draping thick sheets of MARSHMALLOWS
     strung together with candy floss over the diners and
     themselves.

     Margot doesn't move as she's draped in a marshmallow sheet.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
                   (louder)
               I don't like your food.

     Again no one hears. The staff continue to hustle, creating
     elaborate, Jackson Pollock SPLATTERS AND SWIRLS of melted
     CHOCOLATE and GRAHAM CRACKER crumbles atop the tables.

     The SOMMELIER pours dessert wine into glasses, onto the
     tables, and over some diners' heads.

                         SOMMELIER
               This is Borovicka, a SIovakian
               spirit flavored with juniper
               berries. I think you'll find it
               highly flammable and redolent of a
               crisp evening's walk in the shadow
               of Mount Bystrï¿½.

     Margot rises, tears off her marshmallow coat, hurls it onto
     the floor, and CLAPS. Once. Loud.

     Everything stops, just like at the beginning of the meal.
     Chef Slowik looks over from the kitchen.

                         MARGOT
               I don't like your food!

                         MARGOT
               I said I don't like your food. And
               I would like to send it back.

     We see the staff, shocked and ready to kill her. Slowik draws
     a deep breath, and something inside him seems to shift.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I am sorry to hear that. What about
               my food is not to your liking?

     Margot draws a deep breath and then lets him have it. We
     slowly PULL CLOSE on her face as she calmly, coldly, and
     quite sensibly critiques his entire style of cuisine.

                          MARGOT
               You've taken the joy out of eating.
               Every dish we've had tonight was
               some intellectual exercise rather
               than something you just want to sit
               and enjoy.

     The COOKS can't believe what she's saying, even if deep down
     they know there's a kernel of truth to it.

     Chef Slowik and Margot face each other squarely in the dining
     room, like a sort of final showdown.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               When I eat your food, it tastes
               like it was made with no love.

                         SLOWIK
               That is ridiculous. I always cook
               with love. Everyone knows love is
               the most important ingredient.

                         MARGOT
               You're kidding yourself.

     Chef reacts.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Isn't tonight a night where we face
               some hard, home truths? You cook
               with obsession, not love.

     Chef is silent. This hits.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Even your hot dishes are cold. And
               dead. Like they were made by one
               of those fish hanging in your
               little smoke shack. You're a chef.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Your one single purpose on this
               Earth is to serve people food that
               they will like. And you've failed.
               You've bored me. And worst of all,
               I'm still fucking hungry.

     Chef Slowik takes it all in and nods slightly.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               You're still hungry?

                          MARGOT
               I am.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               How hungry?

                          MARGOT
               Starved.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               What are you hungry for?

                         MARGOT
               What do you have?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Everything.

                         MARGOT
               You know what I really want?

                          CHEF SLOWIK
               Tell me.

                         MARGOT
               A cheeseburger.

     The word gives him a moment of real pause. Chef Slowik thinks
     about this. He nods.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               We can do a cheeseburger.

                         MARGOT
               I mean a real cheeseburger. Not
               some fancy deconstructed avant
               bullshit.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I will make you a very good, very
               traditional cheeseburger.
58       PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)   105.


               MARGOT
     I don't think you can.

               CHEF SLOWIK
     I will make you feel as if you are
     eating the first cheeseburger you
     ever ate. The cheap one your
     parents could barely afford. The
     one that tasted better than any
     other cheeseburger in the world.

                MARGOT
     Show me.

               CHEF SLOWIK
     How do you like it?

               MARGOT
     Medium. American cheese.

               CHEF SLOWIK
     American cheese is the best cheese
     for a cheeseburger because it melts
     without splitting.

               MARGOT
     And no weird homemade artisanal
     ketchup. I want Heinz.

               CHEF SLOWIK
     I make a special sauce that's equal
     parts Heinz, mayo, and hot dog
     mustard.

               MARGOT
     That sounds weird.

               CHEF SLOWIK
     You want it. It's delicious.

               MARGOT
     How much will this set me back?

                CHEF SLOWIK
     $9.95.

               MARGOT
     That come with fries?

               CHEF SLOWIK
         (over his shoulder)
     Niels!
58                   PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)         106.


                            SOUS-CHEF NIELS
               Yes, Chef?

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Is the fryer still on?

                            SOUS-CHEF NIELS
               Yes, Chef.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
                   (to Margot)
               Crinkle-cut or Julienne?

     LATER

     The sound of cooking. Slowik is alone in the kitchen. The
     entire staff has gathered in the dining room. The tension in
     the room has oddly dissipated. Margot waits patiently.

     Chef emerges from the kitchen and, sloshing across the liquid
     still covering the floor, places a plate in front of her.

     It looks, no shit, like the best cheeseburger ever. A
     SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, "SUPPLEMENTAL COURSE: `A
     CHEESEBURGER - just a well-made cheeseburger"

     Margot looks at it and nods. Then she picks it up and takes a
     bite. She closes her eyes and savors the bite for a long
     glorious beat. Then she opens her eyes and looks at Chef.

                         MARGOT
               Now that is a cheeseburger.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Yes. That is a cheeseburger.

     They smile and share this moment. Margot takes a deep breath.

                         MARGOT
               Unfortunately, my eyes were a
               little bigger than my stomach.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               I understand.

                         MARGOT
               Can I get the rest to go?

     DOLLY IN on   Slowik as he thinks. He looks around his
     restaurant.   The ferocious beauty of his food. The havoc he
     has caused.   The totality of his life. And somehow he knows
     this is the   perfect ending to his menu. He nods. And smiles.
58                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)          107.


                         CHEF SLOWIK
               One moment, please.

     Chef Slowik walks back to the kitchen and we watch as he
     delicately wraps Margot's burger and puts it into a Hawthorn
     to-go bag. We linger on him for a moment before he walks back
     into the dining room. He believes he's doing the right thing.

     He gives Margot the burger. Along with a Hawthorn gift bag.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               Thank you for dining at Hawthorn.

     Margot reaches into her purse and hands Chef a $10 bill.

                         MARGOT
               Thanks for everything. Goodnight.

     Margot take a last look at Chef and Richard and Anne and
     walks out of the restaurant. And we sense, perhaps, that she
     is also walking away from the life she had. Away from a world
     of men she is now finally done with.

     Chef Slowik CLAPS.

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               So. Before our final course, there
               is the matter of the bill.

     Servers place CHECKS on the tables, along with little
     Hawthorn gift bags.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               We're on a no-tip system, so
               gratuity is included. Please enjoy
               your gift bags. A few goodies in
               there -- a booklet of our local
               suppliers, some house-made granola,
               one of Doug Verrek's fingers, and a
               copy of tonight's menu.

     LILLIAN BLOOM reaches for his wallet until Ted stops her.

                         TED
               No, this is on the magazine.

     He notices that Lillian is almost about to cry.

                          TED (CONT'D)
               I know.

                         LILLIAN BLOOM
               No, it's just - I just realized
               I'll never get to write about this.

     On CHEF-- devilishly satisfied by this odd form of revenge.

     RICHARD reaches for his wallet with his one good hand and
     gives it to Anne.

                         RICHARD
               Can you take out my Amex?

     He looks at her.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
               Anne?

                         ANNE
               I don't want an apology, Richard.

                         RICHARD
               Happy Anniversary.

     EACH TECH BRO tosses in a credit card -- they're going Dutch.

     The movie star puts down his card.

                         FELICITY
               I am your friend.

     The movie star smiles at his only friend.

                         MOVIE STAR
               Told you you weren't leaving.

     BACK TO CHEF

                         CHEF SLOWIK
               Again, thank you all for dining
               with us tonight. You represent the
               ruin of my art, and my life, but
               now you get to be a part of it. A
               part of what I hope is my
               masterpiece. Well done. Give
               yourselves a hand.

     With Chef's prompting, the guests slowly begin to clap. The
     movie star can't help but give it up sincerely for himself
     and for a fellow artist. The cooks applaud as well.

     Tears well in Chef Slowik's eyes. He pauses, takes a deep
     breath. He has somehow found... release.

                         CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
               And now, our final dessert course
               is a playful twist on a comfort
               food classic...

59         EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - NIGHT                                59

           From afar we see Margot board the coast guard boat.


59A        INT. HAWTHOWN DINING AREA AND KITCHEN--CONTINUOUS           59A

           The staff has now surrounded Chef in a semi-circle.

           A sous-chef turns several knobs on the wall so that the
           lighting is nearly dark, but almost a spotlight on chef.

           Katherine applies a marshmallow jacket to Slowik.

                               CHEF SLOWIK
                         (to Katherine)
                     Thank you, chef.

           The slightest nod from Katherine.

                               CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                     The S'more: the most offensive
                     assault on the human palate ever
                     contrived. Unethically sourced
                     chocolate and gelatinized sugar
                     water imprisoned by industrial
                     grade biscuit. It's everything
                     wrong with us and yet we associate
                     it with innocence. Childhood. Mom
                     and Dad.

           Chef looks at his mother, who is passed out at her table.

                               CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                     But what transforms this fucking
                     monstrosity is fire. The purifying
                     flame. It nourishes us, warms us,
                     re-invents us, forges and destroys
                     us.

           Tears in the eyes of our diners. They know what's happening.

                               ANNE
                         (quietly)
                     Please --

           But is she pleading for him to stop... or to continue?

                                CHEF SLOWIK
                     We must embrace the flame. We must
                     be cleansed. Like martyrs or
                     heretics we can be subsumed and
                     made anew.

       Chef strikes a match and tosses it in the flammable pool. A
       watery curtain of blue flame billows across the floor.

       A warm, metamorphic glow illuminates the FACES of our diners.

       CLOSE ON Chef Slowik's serene, smiling face in the firelight.


60     INT. COAST GUARD BOAT - NIGHT                                60

       Margot steers the boat with one hand on the wheel, gazing
       wearily into the distance, Hawthorn Island at her back.

       But then the engine stalls. The PROPELLORS stop spinning. The
       boat just drifts there in the water, maybe a half a mile or
       more from the island.

       Margot tries for a bit to fiddle with the controls and
       restart the engine. But it's no use.

       Finally, nothing else to do, she goes and quietly sits on the
       deck of the boat. It's a beautiful night.

       She gazes at faraway Hawthorn Island. BRIGHT FLAMES begin to
       rise inside the restaurant. Soon it is a warm, shimmering
       inferno casting orange reflective streaks across the water.

       Margot sits and gazes silently at the distant fire. She takes
       the cheeseburger from the to-go bag and eats it as she
       watches Hawthorn and everyone inside it burn, the flames
       dancing in her eyes.

       Then she takes the MENU from the gift bag and uses it as a
       napkin to dab her lips.

                        AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                               "FINAL COURSE"


61     EXT. ISLAND - MORNING                                        61

       FIREFIGHTERS scavenge through the charred remains of Hawthorn
       Restaurant. We STEADICAM through the wreckage, passing the
       remains of the dining room and the kitchen. We may pass some
       rescue workers trying to force a stubborn charred four
       fingered hand into a body bag

       A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: "DESSERT: `S'MORE' - marshmallow,
       chocolate, graham cracker, customers, staff, restaurant."

       We finally reach the locked SILVER DOOR, the portal to the
       room inside, which has somehow not burned.
61                 PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT (09/05/21)         111.


     It's like a jumbo-sized version of an airplane black box.
     Officers blow the door with an explosive, and it opens in a
     plume of smoke.

     We continue in through the door. When the smoke clears, we
     see the interior -- a bare room with only a single table in
     the center. On top of the table rests a framed photograph.
     The same photograph Margot saw in Chef's home.

     We hurtle closer still and finally see what Margot saw: A
     photograph of a YOUNG CHEF SLOWIK, perhaps at his first
     summer job at a fast food stand. He has a big smile on his
     face and an apron that reads "Kiss the Chef." He's never been
     happier, his face lit by the fire of the grill.

     And he's flipping the world's most perfect cheeseburger.

                                THE END
