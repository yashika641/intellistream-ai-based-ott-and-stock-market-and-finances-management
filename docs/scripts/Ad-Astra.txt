SUPERIMPOSE THE LEGEND: ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW.


BLACK.

We TILT DOWN to REVEAL:

THE EARTH, AS VIEWED FROM ABOVE.

We HEAR MUSIC: a CHEERFUL PIECE, incongruous with the awesome
image of our planet.

                                                  CUT TO:

A NEWS REPORT on PBS.

The introductory music accompanies the logo for the Public
Broadcasting System.


EXT. SKY - DAY

The bright blue sky of EARTH. Then: THE LARGEST ANTENNA
WE'VE EVER SEEN. A structure stretching inconceivably high
in the sky, into the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around
100,000 feet in the air. A majestic lattice of multi-wire,
high-voltage tethers, studded with hardware. Towering from
earth, up through and above the cloud formations. Over THIS,
an UPBEAT VOICE:

                    REPORTER'S VOICE
          If this looks to you like something
          out of one of your children's comic
          book adventures, then you're not
          alone!

SERIES OF SHOTS of the ANTENNA UNDER CONSTRUCTION over which
the reporter narrates:

                    REPORTER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          But child's play it isn't. This
          represents the beginning of a new
          era in celestial communications.
          It's called the Gravitational
          Interferometer Space Antenna, or
          "GISA," to those of us who can't
          remember that mouthful. Its goal?

SERIES OF SHOTS of WORKERS in what look like SPACESUITS. On
scaffolding, hanging from wires, etc. OVER THESE IMAGES:
                                                          2.

                    REPORTER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          To search throughout the universe
          for intelligent life. With the
          recent confirmation of so many
          planets capable of sustaining life
          throughout the galaxy, GISA may
          finally prove, once and for all,
          that we are not alone.

File footage of ASTRONAUTS on SPACEWALKS.

                    REPORTER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          The antenna will allow us to listen
          in, across the galaxy, through
          gravitational waves--seen as the
          ultimate means of communication
          through space.

Now: footage of MACHINES going this way and that, spinning a
lattice of tethers. They're almost like spiders on a web.
Or HYDRAS, with CYCLOPS-LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS in their centers.

                    REPORTER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Self-replicators are used for its
          construction. And it's not just
          machines; a select few highly-
          trained folks from the Army Corps
          of Engineers will have to check
          every inch of the carbon fiber for
          flaws. It has proven one of the
          most demanding jobs on Earth, but
          these men and women are up to the
          task. Engineer Major Roy McBride
          of Las Cruces, New Mexico, says
          he's not afraid of the challenge:

IMAGE OF FOUR YOUNG MEN and TWO YOUNG WOMEN, seated on a
SOFA, in a nondescript office environment with an Army Corps
of Engineers logo/graphic on a screen behind them.

One of them is ROY MCBRIDE.

Roy McBride: forties, handsome. His eyes are light blue,
seemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himself.
He is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; there
is an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel or
petty, and to talk to him, one could never question his
intentions or his integrity.

Roy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he does
not want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincere,
precise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the
occasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost for
self-amusement. He does not seem morose.
                                                          3.

In fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often lights up
with little motivation. He speaks with a very slight
Midwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong.

As he speaks, on the screen appears the title "Maj. Roy C.
McBride".

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          The Army Corps of Engineers trains
          us to deal with our fears. And
          this team here is real inspiring--
          Lt. Parsegian did a repair skywalk
          during an episode of pulmonary
          edema. Now when you see something
          like that, you just wanna get up
          there and do it as good as she did.
          Be part of that team. So we all
          feed on each other in that way.

                     REPORTER'S VOICE
          McBride is only the latest in a
          long line of aerospace pioneers.
          His father, noted activist and
          educator H. Clifford McBride, was
          part of an astronaut colony
          tragically lost in space eighteen
          years ago.

It is CLIFFORD MCBRIDE whom we're LOOKING AT. Looks somewhat
like Bill Clinton in that old Georgetown photo--almost like a
countercultural figure, a sharp contrast with Roy's buttoned-
down appearance.

ANGLE BACK ON ROY:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          My Dad was...he was certainly a
          different kind of astronaut. He
          was a free-thinker. He went all
          the way to Neptune. It didn't end
          up going the way he wanted, but
          he's the reason I do what I do. I
          just think you can't worry too much
          about the past because you don't
          have control over it. So I look
          forward. And like I said, we've
          certainly got ourselves a helluva
          team here.

                    REPORTER'S VOICE
              (cheerful again)
          That team is always on the go.
                    (MORE)
                                                              4.

                     REPORTER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           In the clouds, it's all about the
           work, and one gets the sense that
           Roy would rather be left alone to
           perform his duties than talk to
           this reporter:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           What I want...is to serve, to do my
           job as good as I can, away from the
           spotlight. It's real critical to
           maintain control and not to be
           vulnerable to outside factors.

Roy flashes that smile.

                     REPORTER'S VOICE
           With all of the risks, do you ever
           contemplate the larger meaning of
           what it is you're trying to
           accomplish? How we may be able,
           for example, to detect intelligent
           life out there, and find out what
           they might have to say to us?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           No...not really... That's not for
           me to comment on--I don't consider
           that sort of thing.
               (the smile returns)
           But...I do thank you for your
           interest in the program, and we
           hope your continued support leads
           to our success.

ANGLE ON ROY as we:

                                                 FADE OUT.
FADE IN:


EXT. GISA TETHER STATION - DAY

The ANTENNA STRETCHES HIGH INTO THE SKY.   LOOKS LIKE IT'S
ALMOST DONE.


INT. GISA TETHER STATION - DAY

We are inside a crowded, cramped place, where no attention is
paid to aesthetics and a lot is paid to practicality.
Exposed wires and computers and electronics. A circular logo
of "GISA" (The Gravitational Interferometer Space Antenna).
                                                            5.


Video monitors are everywhere, but so are signs of
recreation: a ping-pong table, board games, cards, etc are
mixed with more high-tech gaming equipment.

HANK WILLIAMS' MUSIC is PLAYING.    It's sort of like a party
atmosphere here.

CLOSE ON: MEN AND WOMEN SMILING--and looking into the CAMERA.
Waving, gesticulating, clapping, egging us on. But we can't
HEAR them; we HEAR MERELY the Hank Williams and the SOUND of
WHIRRING: an AIRPACK, for a spacesuit of some kind.

It is Roy's POINT-OF-VIEW. He walks in a SPACESUIT and
HELMET, in his own world. A RADIO voice breaks in, over the
Hank Williams:

                     RADIO
               (OS VOICE, RADIO FILTER)
           Let's see, we got some scores for
           ya, Roy... It was Auburn over
           Georgia Tech, 35-16... Oklahoma
           17, Syracuse 9... And San Diego
           State beat Oregon, 23-20.

                     SMILING WOMAN
               (muffled; through radio
                filter)
           Skywalk 714! You go, boy!

Roy waves, gives the thumbs up.    Then:


INT. POD

Aided by three men in white jumpsuits (the back of which are
stamped by corporate logos for RAYTHEON), Roy is positioned
inside a small compartment with a LATCH. To a jumpsuited man
named SAL:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           I guess there won't be too many
           more of these soon, huh Sal.

                     SAL
           Yes sir, almost done!

Sal STARTS PUNCHING SOMETHING into a NEARBY COMPUTER. Roy
REACHES AROUND SAL'S EAR, PULLS a GOLF BALL from behind his
EAR.

Roy taps Sal, who smiles at the quite nerdy trick, nodding--
he's seen it before. Roy GRINS WIDELY. The STEEL DOOR
SLIDES OPEN, and SAL GENUFLECTS...
                                                          6.


Only now do we realize that we've been in a STATION floating
inconceivably high in the sky. Not in space, certainly
earthbound, but frighteningly high up--higher than any
aircraft we've ever been inside of.

We move outside, above a small PLATFORM.


EXT. THE BRIGHT BLUE ATMOSPHERE

We're in the outer reaches of the atmosphere--around 100
thousand feet in the air. The ground far below is both blue,
where the waters are, and tawny, where the land is. The
earth's curvature is beginning to be apparent.

The air is frigid and thin, and the environment hostile. But
there is no doubt it is beautiful. We aren't in space; we
are still connected to the earth, as Roy stands at the
station's exterior.

We cannot SEE his face, which is SHIELDED by his helmet's
dark visor. We go with Roy as he steps out of the pod and
walks onto--


EXT. GISA PLATFORM

Roy BEGINS TO CLIMB DOWN a SMALL LADDER. HAIR-RAISING
SILENCE. Roy looks UP. The EDGE OF SPACE ABOVE. Back down:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER)
          The earth sure is beautiful today.
          As always...

As he MOVES, we SEE, BELOW HIM, the TETHER CORDS, NEVER-
ENDING, or so it seems. And, THOUSANDS OF FEET BELOW ROY,
THE EARTH. It passes below his FEET, and it's just the most
spectacular vista. The CLOUD FORMATIONS are like Van Gogh's
"Starry Night," magnificent swirls, vibrant.

Between Roy and the ground is much air activity. About a
dozen shuttles (mostly unmanned) crisscross below us,
carrying tethers, busses, tether-deployment spools, and other
building blocks for modular architecture. Some tethers are
dozens of miles long.

SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES, looking like HYDRAS made of
GRAPHENE, maneuver up and down the antenna.

With the shuttles below him, and SATELLITES high above him,
Roy is sandwiched--with a lot of space--in between.
                                                             7.

The project is visually exciting, but for Roy, it's business
as usual. We HEAR STATIC. And out of the STATIC, ROY'S
RADIO FILTERED VOICE:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Control, I have established visual
          with tether oh-niner-four-five.
          Please confirm it is offline.
          Over.

                    CONTROL (RADIO FILTER)
          That's affirmative, Roy. Tether oh-
          niner-four-five is offline.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Roger that.

Roy floats down perpendicularly alongside a several-mile-
long, multi-wire structure.

Roy appears small, like an ant on a tree. We HEAR HIS
BREATHING...

He rappels down, rather gracefully. Turns some kind of a
wheel that allows two parts of the tether to become attached.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Control, I am...closing the loop
          now. Over.

A POWER SURGE has HIT THE TETHER.   Roy is STARTLED:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
              (some concern)
          Control, I just experienced some
          unusual power surges. They appear
          to be quite extreme.

                    CONTROL (RADIO FILTER)
              (alarmed, but completely
               under control)
          Uh, yeah Roy, we picked that up
          too. We--we advise aborting here,
          we uh, repeat--we do advise
          aborting.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Control--I have not yet completed
          my tasks--

Suddenly: along the entire length of the tether to which Roy
is attached, the busses' ACTIVATION LIGHTS come on, one by
one. (The lights are how we tell the structure is active.)
The HYDRA MACHINES START UP AGAIN!
                                                              8.

Roy can see the tether is becoming active, section after
section, at breakneck speed--and he pushes himself away from
it at the last second, just as it ACTIVATES.

He REBOUNDS against another, parallel (ACTIVE!) tether, IS
SHOCKED, as he RICOCHETS against it--changing directions--and
begins to SPIN out of control.

He SPINS SO VERY FAST...    Is he DEAD...?

But remarkably, he's able to speak--rather calmly, given the
situation.

                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
                 (through heavy breaths)
             Control--

As Roy continues to tumble, the radio in his helmet squawks
away--though never in a panicked tone:

                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
             Obviously a serious malfunction
             here--I've lost balance, over.

ROY CONTINUES TO SPIN, CRAZILY, MADLY.    VIOLENTLY.    He barely
avoids hitting more tethers...

                        ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
             I'm gonna try and level out as soon
             as this air thickens up.
                 (beat)
             Control?
                 (beat)
             Control, do you read?

NO ANSWER.

Then, as he descends: ROY STRETCHES HIS ARMS and LEGS OUT.
In the DENSER AIR, HE STOPS THE SPIN.

At last, Roy straightens himself out.    Like a great skydiver.

HE PULLS THE RIPCORD...

A PARACHUTE shoots out from the back of his suit and opens
with tremendous force, YANKING HIM UP and AWAY FROM US.

He RIGHTS HIMSELF and begins to float safely to the earth...

                                                       CUT TO:
                                                         9.


EXT. COLORADO MOUNTAINS - PLATEAU

Roy sinks to the surface. A WIDE SHOT as we SEE: SCORES of
PEOPLE RUNNING TO HELP HIM...

                    MAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
          I must say, you seem to be in
          remarkably good shape, Major.


INT. HOSPITAL - COLORADO SPRINGS CAMPUS - NIGHT

A ROW of HOSPITAL BEDS. Roy is sitting up, on one of them.
Each seat/bed has a SCREEN NEXT TO IT. Large WINDOWS LOOK
OUT INTO THE COLORADO WILDERNESS.

A pair of MED TECHS are here, doing CHECKS on Roy.

Roy sits alongside a window as they check his heart, lungs,
blood pressure, temperature, etc. Roy looks out the window.
Earth, dusk. Beautiful, with cloud formations. He has
trouble keeping eye contact with the Medical Officers. A MAN
takes ROY'S PHOTOGRAPH.

                    MED TECH #1 (CONT'D)
          How d'you feel?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Well...my left shoulder's a little
          sore. It was likely hyperextended
          at some point during descent.

                     MED TECH #1 (CONT'D)
          Yeah, you got yanked around pretty
          good. But you're in one piece.
              (beat)
          Sad to say, some of your fellow
          engineers weren't so fortunate.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
              (beat)
          What's that, sir?

                    MED TECH #1
          We lost your support crew, on the
          wire--and four hundred some odd
          more here on earth, too. Been
          tragic.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Gee... That's real unfortunate.
          I'm real sorry to hear that...
                                                         10.


                    MED TECH #2
          Would you like the shades down,
          Major?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          No, it's okay. I like to observe
          the, the cloud patterns and the
          mountains.

The Med Tech hears this, nods, then TYPES something into a
small iPad-type device, except it unscrolls. The CAMERA
TILTS UP the ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT TO SEE: "MILD AUTISM".

As the Med Techs pack up, Med Tech #1 holds an earplug-sized
item.

                    MED TECH #1
              (hands Roy the earplug)
          You might want to put this in your
          ear, sleep with it overnight. Just
          to check for any head trauma. And
          try to stay put, if you can.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yessir. I would like to be able to
          return to my work.

                    MED TECH #1
          [If] Your head checks out, you can
          be cleared to go back as soon as
          tomorrow.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Okay. I'd like that very much.
          Given all that's occurred, they're
          probably pretty shorthanded up
          there.

                    MED TECH #1
              (stares for a beat; then)
          Of course. Try to rest.

He packs up and leaves.


INT. DORMITORY - LATER

Roy is in bed, sitting up in hospital whites. A GREEN LIGHT
and a BUZZ to his left. He PUSHES A BUTTON. PROJECTED in
front of him, a very advanced form of FaceTime is showing:

His mother. LEANNE MCBRIDE. Late sixties. Seems older than
her age; her face is lined, her mouth slightly downturned.
                                                          11.

She SEES him, EXPLODING WITH EMOTION. The sound is worse than
the image, for some reason:

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE
          Roy!

TEARS FLOW FORTH from HER:

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Thank the Good Lord! I couldn't
          lose you up there too. You're all
          I've got...

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Hello, Ma. I'm all right. I'm
          gonna go back to work soon.

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE
          I love you--so much. I was just so
          sick with worry--

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (smiles)
          There's no reason for any kind of
          concern. The fuss is unnecessary.

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE
          Oh Lord... I know you don't
          understand--you can't. Maybe
          someday you will... I'm sorry
          you're alone there...

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          It's okay.
              (beat)
          I prefer it.

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE
          I love you, Roy. You'll always be
          my little one. Maybe I can see you
          for Thanksgiving?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          It's possible. Goodbye, Ma.

                    LEANNE MCBRIDE
          Goodbye, darling.

He PUSHES A BUTTON and it SHUTS OFF the image...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:
                                                          12.

INT. DORMITORY - LATE NIGHT

The room is DARK. ROY is prostrate, in bed, asleep.
RESTLESS. We HEAR his PULSE, HIS HEART...

Roy's EYES OPEN, and he is COVERED IN SWEAT.   His EYES WIDEN--
like he's SEEING A GHOST.

AWAKE, he has a VISION.   FLASHING:

An image appears to him, and to us: The striking eyes and
most of the face of a YOUNG BOY. He seems around 8 years-
old, looking off-screen at something. He's smiling and
blinking, in EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW MOTION.

But the image is very UNCLEAR. It's BLURRY, almost like a
reclaimed moment from the Zapruder footage.

WIDER SHOT -- again, EXTREME SLOW MOTION. A SMALL BOY
(probably the same person as the one in the previous image)
runs across what might be a wet, cobble-stoned street, on a
cloudy day. This time:

A GIRL, an OLDER GIRL, is JOINING HIM.   The image is
haunting.

The final image: striking, mainly because it's so odd. A
MEDIUM SHOT of what looks like a MEDIEVAL CASTLE (!) IRON
GATE, COMING DOWN, in the same EXTREME, STEP-PRINTED, SLOW
MOTION as in the other image.

ROY'S BREATHING BECOMES LABORED.

CLOSE SHOT on ROY as he then looks out the window. His panic
abating somewhat, he allows his head to REST back, ON THE
PILLOW. His EYES DART BACK AND FORTH, looking out to the
ceiling--and to the heavens...

                                                 FADE OUT.

                                                   CUT IN:


INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

A YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES comes down a hallway.


INT. DORMITORY

She approaches ROY, who is dressed and sitting up. Going
through a "Scientific American" on-screen magazine.
                                                         13.


                    YOUNG   WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
          Morning, Major.    I'm here to take
          you to SPACECOM   Control. For
          debriefing. Is    that okay?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Course, Ma'am.


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - MORNING

It's the center of the base. A big "USSPACECOM" SIGN.   Roy
is being escorted by the woman.

A restaurant, a souvenir stand. MUZAK plays softly.
Families are here, excited. There is a TOURISM BOARD desk (A
SIGN READS, "READY TO MEET AN ALIEN? GO TO SPACE!"). A LARGE
ALIEN CHARACTER, meant to appeal to children, graces the
painted board: "Andy The Alien". Two YOUNG CHILDREN get
their PHOTOS TAKEN in ill-fitting army spacesuits in front of
a powder-blue backdrop.


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - CORRIDOR

Roy is led down a long, winding CORRIDOR until he reaches a
closed door.

                    YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
          Would you like anything to eat or
          drink, Major?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (friendly smile)
          No, thank you. The food's real
          good in the dorm.
                    YOUNG WOMAN IN ARMY FATIGUES
          That's wonderful to hear. We
          brought in a new caterer last month
          and I think it's gotten a lot
          better.

And a LATCH OPENS:


INT. FORT CARSON - CONTROL CENTER - USSPACECOM HEADQUARTERS

This is USSPACECOM's covert ops headquarters. Present are
FIVE of Roy's SUPERIORS. HE SALUTES THEM, mumbles cordial
"HELLOS".
                                                         14.

They are: BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON, LIEUTENANT GENERAL
SHARPE, COLONEL EPINGER, and a woman, ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA
VOGEL, who refers to a PDA-type device.

Among the others here is an older man, seated SILENTLY in the
corner. Observing. His name, we will learn, is DR. MARTIN
PEDROSA. More on him later.

                    BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
          Major, I'm Brigadier General
          Fallon. This is Lieutenant General
          Sharpe, Director of SPACECOM
          Special Operations. And Adjutant
          General Vogel.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (nods; then)
          Sirs. Ma'am.

The DOOR is CLOSED BEHIND THEM. Actually, more SEALED THAN
CLOSED. Fallon motions for Roy to sit, and he does as well.
As the others sit around him, he's looking at a file:

                    BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
          Please--sit down. Your profile's
          certainly very interesting. You've
          done exceptionally well on the
          assessment tests. Says here--
          you've got a near-photographic
          memory. Basic combat...space
          training, too--just exceptional,
          `cross the board.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (subtly prideful)
          Thank you, sir.

                     BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
              (looks up from dossier)
          Your pulse's never gone above 80
          during any spacewalk or skywalk?
          Even on this most recent fall?
          That true?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          It's what we're trained for, sir.
          I can't take any personal credit
          for that.

                    LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
          You know Major, generally we look
          for people like you, people who
          won't let emotions or fears get in
          the way of a task.
                    (MORE)
                                                            15.

                      LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           People who might be called "on the
           spectrum," if you will. I do say
           that with respect.
               (beat)
           So you must not be surprised that
           we've reached out to you.

                      ROY MCBRIDE
           No, sir...I expected a debriefing
           on account of the accident.
               (beat)
           I am surprised that Ops is handling
           it, but it's certainly not a
           problem of any kind.

                     BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
           Well, we've traveled a long way to
           see you here today. And it is not
           a coincidence.

The full-wall VIDEO SCREEN behind Roy plays real-time images
of Fort Carson. Lieutenant General Sharpe consults his PDA
device. Fallon stares at Roy for a moment, then:

                     ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL
           General, we're ready.

                      LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
               (nods; then back to Roy)
           Major, this is not about your
           accident--at least, not directly.
               (beat)
           We have...something of a highly
           classified nature to show you.

On the WALL-SCREEN, A VIDEO begins to play.     LOOKS LIKE OUTER
SPACE. Through a TELESCOPE.

No stars or anything visible. Until, tiny on the screen, a
blue dot. But not the pale blue dot of Earth. CUT TO: CLOSER
SHOT. We SEE that this is the magical, mysterious blue of:

NEPTUNE.

                     LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           That is the planet Neptune you're
           looking at, obviously. Images from
           the Shun-Barcelli Telescope. Two
           days ago.

This distant planet is almost all blue, with none of the
organic brown of Earth.
                                                            16.

It's like a shiny marble jewel, its sheen a uniform hypnotic
ultramarine, except for a few darker streaks and a few white
smudges of elongated clouds. Unearthly, that's for sure.

Then, our vantage point moves, and we CUT CLOSER, longer
focal length. We find our view of Neptune momentarily
obscured by a faint, partial RING of dust and ice. An arc of
white.

And then, an oblong object comes into view between us and
Neptune.

LARISSA.

                     LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           This is one of Neptune's closest
           moons, Larissa.

The small moon is dark against the eighth planet, exhibiting
a mild, azure glow, perhaps the reflection of the color of
Neptune. It's heavily cratered.

We gradually perceive that something odd is going on:

                     LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           The degradation begins here.
           Followed by--

The peaceful blue diorama is suddenly invaded by a faint
greenish blush that starts small as a pinprick and grows
slowly larger. All is not right with Larissa. Its blue
complexion is overcome by a green blemish which spreads
outwards and seems to utterly transform the moon's very
substance, cracking and fissuring it...

                     LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           Catastrophic destruction.

The moon formerly known as Larissa becomes a color that
alternates between dark green... and dark yellow... and
black... and then...

IT EXPLODES.   IN DEAFENING SILENCE.

Rock and dust scatter in every direction, as gravity fails to
hold together the transformed matter, which now glows green
and yellow.

CLOSE ON ROY'S EYES. Then we linger on this unsettling
scenario, until we return our focus to the unblinking blue
eye that is Neptune...
                                                           17.


                     LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE (CONT'D)
           That event was most likely the
           cause of the fluctuations we
           experienced here, on earth. The
           ones that almost killed you. And
           caused many other disasters on the
           ground as well.

                      ROY MCBRIDE
               (nods)
           I'd surely like to know what caused
           that, sir.

THE LIGHTS COME UP.   Beat.

                     COLONEL EPINGER
           Major, what do you know about the
           Lima Project?

A TURN.   Roy FREEZES for A SLIGHTLY PERCEPTIBLE MILLISECOND:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           It was a research expedition to
           Neptune, sir. From twenty--I'm
           sorry, twenty-one--years ago.

                      COLONEL EPINGER
           Mmm-hmm.   Anything else?

                      ROY MCBRIDE
           Its objective was to construct a
           telescope in order to search for
           signs of extraterrestrial life. My
           father was director.
               (beat)
           All crew were lost.
As everyone takes notes, Adjutant General Vogel slides E-
PHOTOS to ROY. THEY ARE OF HIS FATHER, H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE:

                     COLONEL EPINGER
           Do you remember how his departure
           affected you? It WAS a one-way
           mission, was it not?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           It was, sir. But the family was
           not told his absence would be
           permanent. He said at the time
           only that it was top national
           priority to gain knowledge of
           extraterrestrial life.
                                                            18.

                    COLONEL EPINGER
          And how did you handle that?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          My, my mother has often expressed
          her devastation by his abandonment.
              (beat)
          It's the consensus that his
          departure was unforgivable.

Roy lets loose a small laugh(!).   An AWKWARD BEAT.   He
sobers:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Sir, if you're trying to test my
          loyalty or fitness here, it's not
          necessary. I assure you, I'm in no
          need of any kind of support in this
          manner. I do accept my father's
          mental illness. And I acknowledge
          it led to the mission failure.

The others look at each other.

                     COLONEL EPINGER
          Roy, we have something that might
          come as quite a shock to you.
              (beat)
          We've intercepted secret
          communications sent to Neptune, we
          believe from Mars. They lead us to
          conclude that your father and
          others from the Project are still
          alive and for reasons we do not
          understand, appear to be conducting
          some extremely dangerous
          experiments. About which we are
          deeply, deeply, concerned.
                    ADJUTANT GENERAL VOGEL
          The last intercepted communication
          revealed discovery on Neptune of
          large quantities of antimatter,
          Major. Enough when harnessed to
          destroy the entire solar system.

Roy is BLOWN AWAY; that slight smile disappears.   A darkness
overcomes his countenance, and he turns inward.

                    COLONEL EPINGER
          Major?
                                         19.

          ROY MCBRIDE
    (finally; clears throat)
My father is...alive, sir?

          LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
We believe so. The Lima Project's
A.I. is still online, and as you
know, this would indicate crew has
survived. We must ensure they can
do no further harm. As such, your
relationship to him is potentially
invaluable to us.

             ROY MCBRIDE
Yes sir...

           LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
We'd like you to try and contact
whoever is communicating with the
Lima Project. We've determined
that the signal is coming from
Mars. Presumably, any message sent
there would ultimately reach your
father, on Neptune. We've tried
already without success. It's a
bit of a Hail Mary...but we'd like
YOU to give it a shot, find out his
location and any other information
you can gather.
    (beat)
You'll have to go to a secure spot
on the moon, of course--for a
quantum connection that can't be
hacked.

          ROY MCBRIDE
Sir, in the event that contact is
made, you will then...attempt to
apprehend him and bring him to
justice?

            LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHARPE
That is our intention, yes. Can we
count on your participation?
     (beat)
Roy?

          ROY MCBRIDE
Well sir, I--I'm just trying to
understand--

          BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
Major, have you not been
LISTENING?!?
          (MORE)
                                                         20.

                    BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON (CONT'D)
          Your father has threatened the
          destruction of our entire solar
          system. Does that not mean
          ANYTHING to you?!?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Yessir.   It surely does.

Beat.

                    DR. PEDROSA (O.C.)
          Roy, I'm Dr. Joao Pedrosa.

About to answer, Roy turns. At that moment, the old man off
to the side, Dr. Pedrosa. He speaks with a much kinder tone:

                     DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
          I am currently Commander of
          SPACECOM lunar operations, at
          Tycho. I knew your father very
          well--we studied neuroscience
          together, at Purdue University. He
          was a very brilliant man--a true
          legend in the department. He
          looked at things his own way and
          contemplated vast concepts. So I
          can understand well his struggles--
          because keeping sanity in the face
          of the infinite can be a monumental
          challenge.

Pedrosa gets up, approaches:

                    DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
          Like you, I was skeptical of his
          survival. But after reviewing the
          Neptune transmissions, I am now
          convinced of their authenticity.
          Of course under usual
          circumstances, you would want no
          part of this. But if he is truly
          alive, we do not dare lose him
          twice. Will you help us try to
          find him?

ANGLE ON ROY. Roy looks down again, at the screen. It's an
electronic DOSSIER. (Like an old-fashioned bank file, that
opens, but its papery surface is capable of displaying
digital information. Such as photos, maps, graphs, etc.)
They PUSH THE FILE GENTLY TOWARD ROY. He sees his FATHER'S
IMAGE in a photograph. He STARES AT IT. Roy looks back up
at the men:
                                                            21.


                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I will, sir.

                    BRIGADIER GENERAL FALLON
          You depart for the moon in twenty-
          four hours.

Adjutant General Vogel SLIPS HIM a black leather folder:

                    ADJUTANT GENERAL AMELIA VOGEL
          All non-relevant information has
          been redacted. Please familiarize
          yourself with its contents...

The sound FADES OUT as we:

                                                    CUT TO:


INT. PREP ROOM

A small, bright room dedicated to preparing for space travel.
What looks like black leather Eames chairs, cases, men and
women in white pants and shirts helping astronauts get ready.
Roy is being fitted with his suit. Roy slides open a kind of
foldable iPad and places EARBUDS into his ear. We HEAR a
RADIO VOICE:

                    RADIO VOICE
          Slate One-Niner-Four. Transmission
          Lima Project, 7/19/15. Voice of H.
          Clifford McBride.

He is listening to an FILE. We HEAR, with RADIO FILTER:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
              (tone: banal, scientific)
          We're coming to you now from our
          base of operations for the Lima
          Project. And we're going to send
          you images in a bit from our new
          Ocular telescope. Sponsored by our
          good friends at Brookhaven Solar.

OVER THIS: ROY'S POV as: men and women prepare for
spaceflight, finishing their attire--as Roy LISTENS, an IMAGE
of CLIFFORD MCBRIDE comes up on his screen. It is like a
Skype call gone wrong; the image is high-quality, but the
feed is poor, vacillating between a still frame of Clifford
McBride and a sped-up image. The AUDIO is constant.
                                                          22.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
          Now that we believe there are
          microorganisms on many extrasolar
          planets, and so many Goldilocks
          planets perfect for life, we ask
          the question, "How soon will it be
          before we find intelligent life in
          the universe?"

ROY'S SCREEN now features IMAGES of SPACE, then NEPTUNE'S
MOONS and NEPTUNE'S SURFACES as the AUDIO CONTINUES:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          We are so excited about this
          prospect. And who really knows if
          we haven't been contacted already?
          Who knows if our cosmic friends
          haven't tried to reach us through
          gravitational waves, or some other
          method we can't fathom? We might
          be cockroaches walking along a
          chessboard, not knowing about the
          great game of chess! Now--I...AM a
          little surprised we don't have
          anything yet. [Surprised by] The
          silence. But--I have confidence.
          So...thank you, Brookhaven Solar!
          We have many--

The SCREEN GOES BLACK. "PORTION REDACTED."

A MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT then checks with Roy.   Roy
CLOSES the SCREEN. Referring to his suit:

                    MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT
          How's that, Major? Not too snug?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No, it's fine, thank you.

                    MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT
          The pre-breathe for the moon should
          take about fifteen minutes.

                       ROY MCBRIDE
          Thank you.

The Man PLACES a BREATHING APPARATUS over Roy's mouth and
nose. He moves to another passenger.
                                                          23.


INT. GALLEY

Roy ascends the narrow scaffolding, with Pedrosa right
behind. It's oddly primitive; the way to the shuttle
entrance is a fifty-foot stepladder which goes straight up to
where the LUNAR SHUTTLE awaits, nose-up. Harrowing climb for
most of us, but there are several people on this ladder,
looking surprisingly businesslike and quotidian.

A VOICE through a LOUDSPEAKER:

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
          Please use the safety straps for
          your wrists as you ascend. You
          will find them located on the rails
          on either side.


INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE

Roy and Pedrosa, on the shuttle. Both men LOOK into a small
SCANNER on the side, near the seats, while stepping on a
DEGAUSSING PAD. Then:

                    VOICE
          Degauss complete.

The craft seems to be part of a consortium between the Army
and a Southwest Airlines-type company. A hi-tech space.
Little attempt at aesthetics--most everything is there for
practicality, functionality. BANAL.

A dozen or so PASSENGERS are aboard.   Roy finds his seat and
snaps together his restraints.

ANNOUNCEMENTS are made in English and then in Mandarin and
Spanish by a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT (a stout, warm woman) is giving
everybody pills and whispering into certain passengers' ears.
Then, aloud, a recording VOICE:

                    FLIGHT VOICE
          As we exit the earth's
          gravitational field, please
          remember: objects will float if not
          properly stored or secured.

                    MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Guys--our rear passenger attendant,
          Michelle Grierson, was...MARRIED
          TODAY, EVERYBODY! GIVE HER A HAND!
                                                            24.

The passengers APPLAUD as ROY strains to see this Michelle
person behind him.


EXT. EARTH - HIGH ANGLE

The shuttle takes off and begins its ascent to the moon.


INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE - LATER

At the moment when gravity is gone, things begin to float--
stray pens, paper, etc. Roy of course has followed the
rules, but his NEIGHBOR, of Indian nationality and middle-
aged and burly, LAUGHS at his own ineptitude as his things
start to float away from him.

Roy SCANS the SCREEN in the SEAT IN FRONT of HIM: MAPS of the
LUNAR SURFACE. CLOSE SHOT on HIS EYES as he PROCESSES the
CONTOURS OF THE MOON'S VARIOUS CRATERS and other AREAS.

The Flight Attendant hands out packages of nuts.   The pilot
makes an announcement:

                    SHUTTLE PILOT'S VOICE
          On the left there, many of you can
          catch an excellent view of Petavius
          on the eastern limb. The moon's
          gibbous period's waning, so you can
          also see the Atlas, to the north.

Roy looks out the window, SEES the landmarks. But also
lights, signs of mining and human development/habitation.
Tracks and angular patterns. Snapping Roy out of his
observing, with an accented voice:
                    A VOICE
          Your first time to the moon?

Roy turns around. It's his NEIGHBOR, across the aisle.     The
NEIGHBOR is of INDIAN DESCENT.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No, sir. I've been a couple times
          before, as a child.

                    INDIAN NEIGHBOR
              (trying to make
               conversation)
          A child! Well, it's my first time!
              (laughs awkwardly; then)
          There's some good new restaurants I
          read, though.
                    (MORE)
                                                           25.

                    INDIAN NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
          I'm staying near Copernicus--they
          tell me that's safe. How about
          you?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          My visit will be very brief.

                    INDIAN NEIGHBOR
          Oh... I'm in artificial
          intelligence.
              (with enthusiasm; wanting
               to talk)
          It's a very strange thing, you
          know, that we have so much
          technology and we keep all our
          systems without any real awareness.
          I understand why, but it's...it's
          strange, no?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (that gentle smile again)
          Sir--I'd really love to talk to
          you, but I'm afraid I'm just not
          allowed. I'm real sorry.

                     INDIAN NEIGHBOR
          Okay.   Okay, no problem!

The Neighbor acts like he's not offended.    But he is.

The Flight Attendant then makes her way down the   aisle and
guides herself via a series of hoops and webbing   overhead.
She checks to make sure everyone is fastened and   happy. She
is handing out PILLS. Roy takes a pill and sips    a drink she
hands him from a straw.
                    SHUTTLE PILOT'S VOICE
              (perfunctory)
          As we begin our approach: in
          accordance with FASA regulations,
          we must remind you that many areas
          of the moon are in a state of
          extreme lawlessness. The United
          States government does not
          recommend travel to certain
          districts--please check your
          nearest USSPACECOM Outpost for a
          complete list. Thank you and safe
          travels.

Roy SECURES HIMSELF as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT hands out A
CUSTOMS FORM CARD to FILL OUT. She HANDS the Neighbor a
STYLUS:
                                                         26.


                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
              (with a laugh)
          Don't steal my pen!

Roy LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW to SEE:

As the craft gets closer to the surface: lots of SATELLITES
of varying sizes. A tether-type system that may remind us of
the GISA.

MINING SITES, GREENHOUSES, SPACE JUNK, DEPOTS, and LIVING
QUARTERS that look like they could be housing complexes in
Boulder, Colorado. There are also HOUSES OF WORSHIP: a large
CHURCH with an open roof (centered by a giant CROSS).

LIT SIGNS ANNOUNCE CHAINS WE RECOGNIZE: McDonald's, Dunkin'
Donuts, etc. MAG-LEV TRAINS link together various bases and
neighborhoods, at extreme velocities.


EXT. MOON - LUNAR BASE

The ship adjusts its gyropscopes and turns over (e.g. in Elon
Musk's rocket designs), making a gentle landing near the
army's TYCHO BASE. The base is heavily guarded.


INT. LUNAR HANGAR

The UNDERGROUND looks almost like New York's Penn Station,
combined with an enormous parking garage and the most banal
of AIRPORTS. The SHUTTLE MOVES into position, closer to an
entrance.


INT. LUNAR HANGAR - CORRIDOR
Dr. Pedrosa leads Roy through the corridor, which is,
weirdly, wood-panelled. Or is it fake wood?

There are FOUR MEN and TWO WOMEN who come from the OPPOSITE
DIRECTION, all talking amongst themselves. When Roy and
Pedrosa walk toward them, they stop talking.

Dogs roam about, smelling them and their belongings. Pedrosa
moves to talk to some of the men and women. Roy face
brightens at the sight of a dog:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
               (to the dog, warmly)
          Hey!    How you doin' there, big
          fella?
                                                         27.


                    DR. PEDROSA
          This is Major Roy McBride. As you
          know, he is here to help us.

                    EVERYONE
              (to Roy)
          Good morning, Major.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (looks up from the dog)
          `Morning.

A WOMAN, LESLIE CORTEZ, fifties, steps forward. A MAN stands
near, holding a PIECE OF EQUIPMENT that looks like a small
EKG machine.

                    LESLIE CORTEZ
          We've kept a spot for you in the
          dormitory. An overnight stay will
          be necessary.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yes, Ma'am. But I'm just here to
          do what I need to. I have my
          duties on the antenna, and they'll
          probably be needing me soon.

                    LESLIE CORTEZ
          Of course...

Cortez leads Roy with her hand as we HEAR:

                    MAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
          Uplink should be ready to go in
          just a moment.

INT. LUNAR BASE - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - LATER

Roy and the others are in what looks like a recording studio.
A glass of water before him. Roy is seated. Dons a headset.

                    TECHNICIAN ONE (CONT'D)
          We're preparing the connection now.

Outside the booth, TWO TECHNICIANS make adjustments.

Roy looks at a MONITOR before him, which gives him cues, as
well as technical info regarding high-rate pulse-position
modulation and error-correcting codes. A RED LIGHT goes on.

Dr. Pedrosa approaches:
                                                           28.


                    DR. PEDROSA
          Whatever you say into this
          microphone will be transmitted to
          Mars, and then hopefully on to
          Neptune. The first step is to try
          to make contact. And then perhaps
          a negotiation of some kind.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yessir.

Interrupting: the CONTROL BOOTH CHIMES IN:

                    TECHNICIAN ONE
          Point-to-point contact with the
          Mars signal is now engaged.
          Through the squawk box, Major.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Roger that.

                    DR. PEDROSA
          Depress the button in order to
          speak. Remember, your father may
          be listening.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Sir... What--what precisely is it
          that you'd like me to say, in order
          for us to achieve optimal results?

Dr. Pedrosa takes out a PIECE OF PAPER:

                    DR. PEDROSA
          We have assembled a text for you,
          one that we believe is appropriate
          for eliciting a response. It is
          written using language consistent
          with your own, utilizing data from
          your profile.

Roy takes the piece of paper. He looks it over.   Weak joke,
but a broad smile nonetheless:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Maybe I should've taken acting
          classes! Okay...here goes...

Roy MOVES to DEPRESS the BUTTON.   FLICKS ON THE MIC.   BEGINS
TO SPEAK:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          This is Major Roy McBride, I'm
          currently on Tycho Base.
                    (MORE)
                                                            29.

                      ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
               (beat)
           Repeat. This is Major Roy McBride.
           I am currently on Tycho Base.

ON THE MONITOR: as he speaks, there's a voice print analysis.

CLOSE ON ROY. Roy's emotions are deeply buried as he READS
THE PREPARED SCRIPT:

                      ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
           Dr. McBride... It's your son, Roy.
               (beat)
           Prior to this message, I believed
           you were dead. Our family was
           informed of this approximately two
           decades ago. We were told the
           stress of deep space had altered
           your behavior. And...as a result,
           US SPACECOM was forced to terminate
           your life support systems.
           However, SPACECOM now believes you
           have survived. And attempted
           contact, without revealing yourself
           due to fear of hacking. If this is
           true, I'm very much looking forward
           to hearing from you. I've always
           felt that it's very important to
           have a true bond between father and
           son. We could have this bond. I
           do recall we would watch motion
           pictures together, very old ones in
           black and white--funny ones. And I
           remember your laugh even more than
           your face. I would like very much
           to reconnect with you. I will
           surely be able to move past any
           feelings of abandonment your
           departure presented me with. Your
           loving son, Roy.

BEAT.   NOTHING.   These words have unlocked something in Roy.

He flicks off the MIC, stands.   Any warmth deserts him:

                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
           Hopefully that achieves the desired
           result.

The PREPARED SPEECH is LIT ON FIRE by a MAN, its ashes placed
in a wastebasket.
                                                           30.


                    DR. PEDROSA
          Any transmission will take
          approximately 36 minutes, due to
          the distance. So we must wait.


INT. HALL - LATER

Roy is standing outside, looks out the large window.
OUTSIDE: A NEARBY SIGN WITH A NEON COWBOY, PUMPING a "THUMBS
UP" GESTURE--just like the famous Neon Cowboy from Las
Vegas's Fremont Ave. Pedrosa EMERGES from the Communications
Center. A grim look:

                    DR. PEDROSA
          There is no response. Thank you
          for your participation. You will
          be returned to the earth tomorrow
          morning.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I understand. Thank you, sir.
          Sorry I was not of more help.

The men shake hands.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LUNAR BASE - BARRACKS - ROY'S ROOM - LATER

The room's almost like an economy room in a hotel. With the
exception being that, out the window, hangs Earth. The
CAMERA DOLLIES OVER TO SEE: a half-eaten meal on a tray.

Roy SITS, near a speaker:
                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Confirming--shuttle 4339, moon to
          earth, reservation number EH77902.
          Last name, McBride.

                    VOICE
          Reservation confirmed, McBride, Roy
          C. Number EH77902.

He hangs up.

A beat.

A TV SCREEN is seamlessly embedded into a wall. Some
programming (news... sports.... something animated...).
                                                           31.

The programming forms a low level of constant noise.   And
then:

The screen CHANGES--completely BLACK.

SILENCE.

A beat.    Roy LOOKS UP.

A light, STATIC NOISE.

FADING IN is the sound of:

A MAN SINGING: "Hello, I must be going./ I cannot stay,/ I
came to say/ I must be going./ I'm glad I came/ but just the
same/ I must be going..."

Roy looks at the SCREEN as GROUCHO MARX APPEARS. Groucho
resumes singing after Margaret Dumont's part: "I'll stay a
week or two,/ I'll stay the summer through,/ but I am telling
you,/ I must be going."

BEEP!   The SCREEN GOES BLACK.   SILENCE.

THEN TEXT, on the SCREEN:

"ARE YOU COMING?"

A SERIES OF NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM of the SCREEN.

CLOSE SHOT: ROY'S EYES.    Then we SEE that the screen GOES
BLACK. We HEAR:

                      ROY MCBRIDE (PRE-LAP)
            They appeared to be coordinates of
            some kind, sir.


INT. LUNAR BASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Roy stands as Dr. Pedrosa and TWO MEN and LESLIE CORTEZ sit
around a conference table, with looseleaf binders in front of
them. MOON PHOTOGRAPHS, illuminated from behind, line the
walls. Chairs all around. Coffee. Roy is reluctant as he
stands at attention. HE STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD, NO EYE
CONTACT. The others seem STUNNED INTO SILENCE.

                      ROY MCBRIDE
            I believe the proper first step
            would be to get me to Mars, to the
            specified coordinates. I would of
            course be willing, in order to help
            resolve this crisis.
                                                    32.

                    LESLIE CORTEZ
          We are very grateful to you for
          your service, Major. We will
          analyze the information you
          received. But you may return to
          Colorado now.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I do feel
          I should continue to aid the
          mission. My father is the
          individual at issue here. And
          under the circumstances I feel I
          should remain involved in order to
          bring him appropriately to justice.

                    DR. PEDROSA
              (leaning forward)
          A personal connection is an unknown
          variable and represents serious
          risk.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yes sir. However, the task itself
          inherently involves risk,
          especially as it appears you will
          not have multiple chances. And if
          it really IS my father who is
          trying to reengage, obviously I
          would be anxious to confront him.
          But I'm also considering the task
          itself, and not merely my personal
          views.

None of them answers.   Roy steps forward:
                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          A situation may arise that only I
          am able to respond to.
              (beat)
          So for this reason, I believe I
          should be part of any continuing
          mission.

Pedrosa can tell that Roy's serious, DETERMINED.

                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Sirs? Ma'am? Do I have your
          permission to continue on in this
          manner?
                                                           33.

ANGLE ON PEDROSA as we:

INT. LUNAR BASE - MAZELIKE CORRIDOR

SECURITY MEN all SURROUND ROY, like he's the President.    A
POV SHOT of ROY as he WALKS toward:

AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR is Dr. Pedrosa.   Over this:

                    DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
          You will travel on a United States
          military craft already designated
          for Mars. It contains a payload of
          a classified but routine nature,
          and the crew will know of you only
          as a passenger--a higher-ranking
          officer making a visitation to the
          outpost. It will depart from
          outside standard surveillance, on
          the Far Side of the moon. As your
          participation was unanticipated,
          the path from our current point
          will take us through only recently-
          settled territory. We will be
          escorted by the United States
          Army's Space Division. And I will
          protect you as far as I am able.


INT. MEDICAL UNIT

Roy is sitting up on a medical table. We STILL HEAR DR.
PEDROSA'S VOICE. A MEDIC approaches ROY. CLOSE SHOT on an
injection into ROY'S ARM.

                    DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
          Members of the crew were selected
          on the basis of skill and limited
          social needs, and as such should be
          no impediment.

                                                CUT BACK TO:


INT. CORRIDOR

Dr. Pedrosa and Roy board a MONORAIL.   As they do, we HEAR:

                    DR. PEDROSA (V.O.)
          You will be contacted by a Colonel
          Lipset once you reach Mars.
                    (MORE)
                                                          34.

                    DR. PEDROSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He will assist you as you attempt
          to communicate with your father.
          Your stress levels will be
          monitored at all times. If
          psychological failure is indicated,
          you will be removed from the
          mission. This is necessary due to
          your relationship with the target.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (V.O.)
          My focus is entirely on achieving a
          proper resolution, sir. You need
          not be concerned. He was
          emotionally unfit, and I am not.

They stop at a GATE.


INT. LARGE HANGAR

Several LUNAR ROVERS are lined up, in the distance. They
aren't SLOW, LUMBERING THINGS, however; they are durable and
tough and fast and filled with artillery.

The ROVERS WHIR and WHINE with ferocity, their engines
warming up and getting ready for the trip ahead.

Roy and Pedrosa enter, joining a host of MILITARY ASTRONAUTS.
One of them, a cheerful, burly man named WILLY LEVANT, late
forties, pulls up an interactive 3D MAP. It shows the LUNAR
TERRITORIES in incredible detail. Roy listens intently as
Levant checks his clipboard.

                    WILLY LEVANT
          Should be fine, but... We're gonna
          be going through what is still
          technically a war zone.
              (looks up, w a laugh)
          Here we are, meant to tame the
          solar system, and instead seems
          like we've just brought our chaos.
          This your first time?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (broad smile)
          No, sir. I've been to many Army-
          Navy games.

                    WILLY LEVANT
              (turns dark)
          This is serious business, Major.
          There's no real way to know how any
          man'll react in combat. It's
          always a surprise.
                    (MORE)
                                                         35.

                     WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
               (louder; to everyone)
           --Almost a full moon. The Far
           Side's gonna be real black.
           Fortunately we should have a clean
           route from here to Veda. We've had
           a little problem since September
           with mining pirates, looking for
           helium-3. But our boys did a
           heckuva job and swept it all up a
           few days ago.

Roy notices that Pedrosa is fiddling with the CRUCIFIX around
his neck. Pedrosa SEES Roy looking at him.

                     DR. PEDROSA
           You wish to join us, Roy?   For a
           prayer?

                     ROY MCBRIDE
               (quietly; without any
                condescension)
           No thank you, sir. It's been my
           experience that prayer doesn't
           affect outcomes.

Pedrosa eyes Roy for a moment, nods, then starts to pray with
Levant and the others as Roy prepares his suit.

                     DR. PEDROSA
           Almighty and merciful God, who hast
           commissioned Thy angels to guide
           and protect us, command them to be
           our companions from our setting out
           until our return...

MOMENTS LATER

Roy and the others--in full SPACESUITS--board a souped-up and
unenclosed LUNAR ROVING VEHICLE (LRV).


INT. LRV

This rover is CRAMPED. Pedrosa has a smaller version of his
mapping COMPUTER in front of him and he is next to Levant.
Levant is driving, and he makes a final consultation of the
route. ON THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD: photos of NUDE WOMEN.
Like old PLAYBOY centerfolds...

Roy is in the back seat:
                                                           36.


                    WILLY LEVANT
          Arright, let's go. Veda, Sea of
          Moscoviensis.

                    RADIO VOICE
          You should be clear to Veda, over.

                    WILLY LEVANT
          Autodrive engaged.


EXT. LUNAR BASE

The LRV departs, bursting forward with ferocity.

NOTE: ALL DIALOG in this sequence will have a "RADIO FILTER"
effect unless otherwise noted.


INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING

Levant is looking around with hi-tech BINOCULARS. Roy is
hunched back, right behind him, watching and listening:

                    WILLY LEVANT
          Setting two-niner-oh.

The LRV traverses the lunar surface.    Occasionally, the lunar
DUST kicks up, obscuring our vision.    The SUN is SHINING, and
yet the SKY IS JET-BLACK.

Roy turns back as the base recedes into the distance. THE
EARTH IS IN THE SKY! PEDROSA POINTS TO IT, then DOWN TO THE
SURFACE, FOR ROY. A TALL OBELISK, made of STEEL, in the
LUNAR DIRT, near the LEGS OF THE LUNAR MODULE:
                    DR. PEDROSA
          [That is] Tranquillity Base
          Monument.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Surely is a magnificent sight.

SERIES OF SHOTS of LUNAR SURFACE.


EXT. THE MOON - MOMENTS LATER

A CARAVAN OF ABOUT TEN BLACK, ARMOR-PLATED rovers that we'll
call the Russian name of LUNOKHODS appear on the horizon,
coming toward our GUYS. The Lunokhods are driven by
mysterious ASTRONAUTS in DARK BLUE SPACESUITS and HELMETS
with mirrored visors.
                                                           37.

                    WILLY LEVANT
              (surprised)
          What the fuck is this...?
              (to radio)
          Alpha, what do we got here?
              (to radio)
          Alpha, we have what looks like
          between ten and twelve mining
          Lunokhods approaching our position.

                    RADIO VOICE
          Roger that, Willy. We'll see if
          they're certified, over.

                    WILLY LEVANT
          I'm sorry, gentlemen. They said
          they'd cleared this zone out. I'm
          sure we'll be on our way in just a
          minute.

AS THEY APPROACH, LEVANT LOOKS THROUGH BINOCULARS.   He
DARKENS CONSIDERABLY.

                     WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Uh...Alpha...we may have some
          problems.
              (beat; more heated)
          They appear to be armed. Possibly
          with stilettos. Backup requested.

Roy STEELS HIMSELF.   The Lunokhods are closing in on our LRV.

                    WILLY LEVANT (CONT'D)
          Alpha, they are definitely assuming
          hostile formation--
              (to computer)
          Engage manual operation.

ROY BRACES HIMSELF. Dr. Pedrosa TURNS AROUND, points to a
BOX next to Roy's FEET. Roy opens the box: WEAPONS.

GRENADES and a GUN which looks ALMOST LIKE a ROCKET LAUNCHER.

(The BLUE ASTRONAUTS in the Lunokhods brandish a weapon
called a STILETTO--an electromagnet-propelled jet of liquid
metal resembling a solid bar of light.)

(VISUAL NOTE: LUNAR DUST PERIODICALLY OBSCURES the VISION.)
                                                             38.

EXT. THE MOON - THE PROMENADE DE LUNA

The LRV turns onto a route that runs adjacent to a POWER
PLANT.

The Lunokhods open fire on our LRV:

                     WILLY LEVANT
               (to radio)
           Alpha, we're now taking fire!   WE
           NEED BACKUP ASAP!


INT. LRV

Everyone bounces forward in their seats, restrained by their
seatbelts.

ROY ARMS HIMSELF. Ahead of them, he SEES three possible
RAMPS: one to the right, one to the center, and one to the
left.

A FORK IN THE ROAD--the left side of the fork is closed off,
blocked by A BARRICADE. The LRV is headed right for it.

At the last second, LEVANT jerks the rover to the right. The
Lunokhod's driver can't react in time. SLAMS INTO THE
BARRICADE. The blue astronaut is hurled from his Lunokhod,
CRASHES through the windshield, flies through the air. The
Lunokhod flips over and over--no air resistance, so it seems
like it won't stop...

LEVANT struggles to control the rover, which is in a major
SPIN.

INT./EXT. LRV - MOVING

OUR LRV stops SPINNING.   RESTARTING, they take the left.

A BULLET/SMALL ROCKET hits the back windshield, which CRACKS
slightly.

The Lunokhods are out of view now, but they're out there.     A
RADIO VOICE pipes in:

                     RADIO VOICE
           COLONEL, WE DO CONFIRM YOU'RE
           FACING PIRATE ACTIVITY. Are you
           all clear now, over?

Roy is LOOKING BEHIND HIM:
                                                          39.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          There're at least two behind us--

                    WILLY LEVANT
              (to radio)
          That's a negative, Hawk. They're
          still out there, behind us at 140
          and 220 degrees.

Roy leans out. His jaw jutting forward just a bit, he seems
anxious to do DAMAGE, a strangely VIOLENT COLDNESS coming
through here. He reaches down, takes out a WEAPON.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (under his breath; to no
               one)
          I will handle these...

He AIMS his WEAPON at the HORIZON. Then it appears. It
COMES CLOSER and CLOSER! The Lunokhod is almost upon them--

HE FIRES HIS WEAPON.

An EXPLOSION. Another Lunokhod appears on the horizon.
Gains on them. ROY AIMS, FIRES AGAIN. ANOTHER PUFF of DUST.

                    WILLY LEVANT
              (surprised)
          Excellent shots, Major!   Excellent!

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Thank you, Colonel.

A DARKNESS OVERTAKES US.   It is PERMANENT NIGHT: THE FAR SIDE
OF THE MOON.


EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE

We now reach the Far Side (i.e. the side always facing away
from Earth) and are weaving amongst Chinese thermonuclear
REACTORS. ENORMOUS LIGHTS SWITCH ON in front of the ROVER.

                    WILLY LEVANT
              (into radio)
          SpaceCom, we've just entered the
          Far Side. We need a push in 2500
          clicks! 240 degrees, 58 seconds!

ROY LOOKS OVER TO PEDROSA.

ANGLE ON PEDROSA, from ROY'S POV.   HE IS SLUMPED FOR A BEAT!
HE SITS BACK UP...
                                                          40.


EXT. THE MOON - FAR SIDE - ROAD

Multiple SPACESHIPS DESCEND and DROP ORDINANCE. "Daisy
cutter"-esque MOABs do their thing. It's gruesome,
spectacular, and Roy SPOTS IT looking behind him.

It's a ferocious scene, vicious and unforgiving, made all the
more bizarre by the utter LACK OF SOUND. The silence and
carnage is astonishing. The EXPLOSIONS are beautiful and
ferocious. The sky's lit up for miles.

MOONBASE VEDA is just ahead--it's built over a massive crater
and is underneath a DOME.

                     WILLY LEVANT
          We are approaching Veda now, Major.
              (beat)
          Godspeed to you, gentlemen.

Pedrosa salutes. Levant and the rest of the crew depart,
unsentimentally, leaving behind DR. PEDROSA and TWO FACELESS
ASTRONAUTS to accompany ROY.


EXT. THE FLATTENED LUNAR LANDSCAPE

Roy disembarks from the LRV, flanked by the Faceless and
Pedrosa. PEDROSA and the TWO MEN BOUND DOWN THE SIDE OF THE
CRATER, with Roy.

They reach the bottom, a LAUNCH PAD for the fusion-powered
craft, THE CEPHEUS.


INT. VEHICLE ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE
A mammoth hangar in a covert underground silo. Greenhouses,
other life-sustaining structures inside, too. The SILO is
IMPREGNABLE, surrounded by a kind of HEAT MOAT which forms a
giant RED CIRCLE around the PAD...

ROY MOVES to a STEEL BAR.   DR. PEDROSA PUTS HIS FOREARM under
a BLUE LIGHT.

The SILO OPENS.


INT. LAUNCH PAD

The spacecraft--THE CEPHEUS--is poised on the pad, glowing in
the beacon lights. Dr. Pedrosa REMOVES HIS HELMET and
GLOVES. Roy does the same.
                                                           41.

We PULL BACK to reveal the massive nature of the
spacecraft/rocket. A WOMAN, SERGEANT ROMANO, approaches:

                    SERGEANT ROMANO
          Major, are you all right? We'd
          been told an officer would be
          joining us, and we heard about your
          trouble getting here--

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yes, Ma'am. The chaos is real
          infuriating, no doubt. But we were
          able to engage them on their terms.

Pedrosa INTERRUPTS Roy, pulling him aside. Something is
WRONG; he's sweaty, white as a sheet. Sotto:

                    DR. PEDROSA
          Roy--please, take it--

He hands Roy a thin silver card.   Roy looks at him,
bewildered:

                    DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
              (sotto)
          It is the redacted section of your
          father's profile. The password is
          "daisywheel". Examine it only when
          you are off the grid. The hard
          drive will protect you from any
          viral interference.

Roy SPOTS BLOOD, CASCADING DOWN Dr. Pedrosa's HAND.    Looks
around for help--

                    DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
          Roy.

Roy spins back around.   Pedrosa grabs him, SMEARING BLOOD on
ROY'S SLEEVE:

                     DR. PEDROSA (CONT'D)
          SPACECOM does not trust you. Try
          to remain as alert as possible; do
          not allow them to cloud your
          perception. And you will be
          required at times to be less than
          completely honest--but you must, to
          preserve the mission and the
          broader truth.
              (beat)
          I have faith in you.
                                                            42.


                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (ferociously; to others)
          MEDIC!

PEDROSA CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. MEDICS COLLAPSE on him as
ROY BACKS AWAY. Roy is SURROUNDED by ARMY, among them
SERGEANT ROMANO. They pull him away from the dying Pedrosa.

Roy holds the CARD in his hand, POCKETS IT.


INT. SILO ELEVATOR

The doors open, Roy exits.   OVER THIS, we HEAR:

                    A WOMAN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
          Major McBride?


INT. SUIT ROOM

Sergeant Romano hands a spacesuit to Roy:

                     SERGEANT ROMANO
          Your vitals are all here, on your
          sleeve. Standard. Pulse, oxygen,
          CO2, blood pressure, and so forth.
              (beat)
          This is your Mission Commander,
          Captain Lawrence Blunt.
              (to Blunt)
          Captain Blunt, this is Major Roy
          McBride, he'll be hitching a ride
          to Mars on the jump seat.

Nearby, three men are donning their suits and going through
their EXHAUSTIVE CHECKLISTS. They eye Roy with varying
degrees of trepidation.

Focus on LAWRENCE BLUNT--early 40s, dark wavy hair, dark
eyes, powerful physical presence.

                     CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
          Right-o.   Welcome aboard.

Blunt shakes Roy's hand.

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (CONT'D)
          Sounds like you went through some
          tough territory to get here, Major.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          We surely did. Significant force
          proved necessary.
                                                              43.


Blunt nods.    He looks through a clipboard, then:

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
          You're certified, I'm guessing.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Yes. In EVA and spacecraft
          mechanics.

ROY NOTICES PEDROSA'S BLOOD ALL OVER HIS SUIT.

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
          Terrific... This's First
          Lieutenant Scobee--our Mission
          Specialist.

He refers to DONALD SCOBEE--late thirties, brown hair in a
comb-over. He's in excellent physical condition. Looks like
old Nixon aide John Dean. He stares at Roy with his piercing
eyes as he extends a hand.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          How do you do.

A handshake.   Scobee is COURTEOUS but tough as NAILS.

                      DONALD SCOBEE
          Major.

And FRANKLIN YOSHIDA. Mid-forties. Totally remote,
taciturn, a man of science. Barely makes eye contact with
Roy.

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
          Frank Yoshida's our Medic. And Lt.
          Alan Tanner is on for navigation
          and payload.

Finally, ALAN TANNER. Early-30s.      A firm handshake and
muttered greeting. Roy responds:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Good to meet all you.

Roy tries to turn his forearm to hide PEDROSA'S BLOOD.

A young CADET walks in with food.     Blunt looks down at an
illuminated SOLAR SYSTEM MAP.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          I am headed to Helios South, on
          Mars.
                                                         44.


                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
          That's pretty close to where we're
          headed. We've got a payload for
          the North division, but you can
          shuttle South once we're there.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Will do.   Grateful for the ride.

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (re: food plate)
          Well all right then... Make
          yourself comfortable. Looks like
          there's some ginger beer and farmed
          salmon for final meal...

Roy turns to Sergeant Romano.   Sotto:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Sergeant--do we know the condition
          of Dr. Pedrosa?

                   SERGEANT ROMANO
          Yes. Unfortunately, he passed,
          Major.

Roy nods, then turns, looks through GLASS at the ROCKET THAT
will TAKE HIM TO THE STARS... THE CEPHEUS... Here, as
everywhere, ARMED MEN and WOMEN abound. Looks down at his
hand: CLUTCHING THAT DOSSIER CARD.


EXT. LAUNCH PAD

Roy, in his SPACESUIT, walks with the others holding their
airpacks into the top of the rocket.

INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

The cockpit is aglow with instruments and screens. Roy moves
past Blunt and Scobee as they are ensconced to perform final
preparations and checks.

Roy STRAPS IN.

                    CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (into the radio)
          Checklists complete. We are ready
          when you are, SpaceCom.
          Destination Helios Station North,
          Mars. Over.
                                                           45.


                    SPACECOM (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
          Affirmative, Captain. T-Minus 15
          seconds. Ready to go.

SpaceCom commences COUNTDOWN.

ENGINES ROAR to life.   The ROCKET SHUDDERS from the force.

                    DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
          Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
          ignition sequence begin. We have
          main engine start.


INT./EXT. THE CEPHEUS

The LIFTOFF TEAM scrambles to get away.    The Cepheus, barely
held to the gantry, is ready to go.


EXT. THE MOON

A great fire alights beneath The Cepheus.

                    DONALD SCOBEE (CONT'D)(V.O.)
          Three, two, one.

The Cepheus rises, shaking off its tethers.

                    DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
          We have lift off...

It explodes forward, hurtling around the Far Side.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - SEDATION AREA
Roy fights the G's.

                    SPACECOM (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
          Cepheus, you are a go at throttle
          up. Stand by for separation.


EXT. THE MOON - CEPHEUS

The Cepheus fires its BOOSTERS and explodes forward, hurtling
around the Far Side with increasing velocity. DARKNESS
returns to the launch pad.
                                                          46.


INT. THE CEPHEUS

The group settles in just a bit. The distant sounds of the
ENGINE are a soothing, rhythmic lullaby.

                     DONALD SCOBEE
          SpaceCom, we are commencing CTP
          ingestion.

Everyone TAKES A PILL which comes ejected from the console--
EXCEPT FOR ROY, who PALMS THE PILL and SLIPS it into his
pocket.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT - LATER

Roy looks at his fellow travelers, all engaged in checklist
tasks, other mundane activities:

                    DONALD SCOBEE
          Pilot report A one-niner, Mars
          trajectory... The burn was on
          time. The residuals before nulling-
          -minus 0.1...

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Captain, I think my suit's suffered
          an oxygen leak. It's going to
          require an epoxy patch.

                    LAWRENCE BLUNT
          Happy to assist, sir.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          That won't be necessary, Captain.
          Thank you. I've got it.
As Roy gets up, we SEE, to his RIGHT: "CAUTION: MANUAL
BOOSTER CONTROL".


INT. CARGO AREA

Roy floats in to a SECLUDED PART of the ship. He pulls out
what Pedrosa gave him. The DOSSIER/AMULET, a thin, silver
card. He inserts it into a slot of a small computer that is
in his sleeve. Inserts an earbud.

LASERS and OPTICS read his irises.   SCREENS on his helmet
inside display his biorhythms.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Password DAISYWHEEL. Slate 23.
                                                           47.

The password and bioscan activate the ELECTRONIC DOSSIER.
The dossier opens up on a screen before him--in what looks
like MID-AIR.

ON SCREEN: "LIMA TRANSMISSION INTERCEPT: 12/14/16.
UNTELEVISED CANADIAN BROADCASTING CHANNEL INTERVIEW: H.
CLIFFORD MCBRIDE"


INT. FIAT LUX - OCULUS BASE

PROFESSOR H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, looking into the camera.
Unlike videos from today's astronauts, these are HD, fluid
images.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
          Hello CBC...Toronto...

H. Clifford McBride is on a space station, but exactly where
is unclear. He looks haggard and unkempt. UNHINGED.

                     H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          I'd like to use this opportunity to
          reach out directly. To my son. If
          you could get this to
          him...please...
              (beat)
          Roy... Solitude has increased my
          perception... I look so far into
          the universe here, and I see how
          cruel it is in its indifference...
          So many planets potentially
          suitable for life, yet as of now we
          hear and see nothing... I've come
          to worry that our own long-term
          survival is in doubt. My death is
          not something I fear. But--the
          extinction of ALL ideas, of all
          human expression--that is the true
          terror. Our consciousness must
          extend into the future, past any
          force that renders us extinct. We
          must commit ourselves to this
          goal...
              (beat)
          And so I, I... If you see this--
          we're, we're real far away. And
          some people haven't been able to
          keep their composure...
              (looks down, avoiding)
          It's been very difficult...
                                                         48.


ANGLE ON ROY. His FACE registers that this is his father,
addressing him directly--and his father doesn't look good.
Roy looks down, at his SLEEVE. His VITALS. Over this:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          I'm sure you will have a lot of
          questions about the choices I've
          had to make. But...    Perhaps
          someday you'll understand. I do
          miss you. I'm sure you miss me,
          too.

ROY'S PULSE STARTS CLIMBING... So he has to stop watching
before the computer redflags his bioactivity...

                                                   CUT TO:


INT. CEPHEUS - CARGO AREA

Roy takes the small stick given to him by Pedrosa and puts it
in an airlock, adding the PILL they gave him to take.
Releases the lever and sends the items into space...lost
forever...

A VOICE, through radio earpiece, from another part of
Cepheus:

                     A VOICE
          Major!   MAJOR!

Roy turns, moves to


INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF CEPHEUS
SCOBEE and YOSHIDA seem to be in some kind of quiet panic.
SILENTLY attending to the equipment around them. Then
Yoshida comes to ROY/US (the camera is NOW SUBJECTIVE) as ROY
settles back into the main area of the craft. Yoshida turns
to Roy, with urgency:

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Major--we're receiving a "mayday"
          from a craft that's in our zone.
          Per regulation, it may require you
          to accompany Captain Blunt on an
          EVA.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No--we can't stop.
                                                         49.


                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
              (surprised)
          Major?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          We need to reach Mars.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
              (smiles, an uncomfortable
               laugh)
          Major, this is protocol. We have a
          mayday--

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          We can't stop!

Roy moves past Yoshida into:


INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTROL ROOM

Roy enters the CONTROL ROOM, sees that the other men have put
on their helmets.

The ELECTRONIC BEEPING alert plays, and DATA flashes across
the main MONITORS on the bridge. Lawrence Blunt to the
radio, with RADIO FILTER:

                    LAWRENCE BLUNT
          Ninety-seven hundred kilometers
          away, on the proximity alert.

ROY LOOKS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO SEE: on a panel screen: the
image of THE VESTA IX. A small, rotating station orbiting of
"Earth's second satellite," the asteroid called TORO. Roy is
agitated:
                    ROY MCBRIDE
          The Helios Station is the
          destination, Captain--why are you
          stopping?

                     LAWRENCE BLUNT
          We have a mayday, major--this is
          standard--
              (INTO COMMS)
          Vesta Nine, this is Cepheus Seven,
          United States Armed Forces Space
          Division. Do you read, over?

Roy looks impatient, unsure how to press the case:
                                                           50.


                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Other craft will be in the
          vicinity. We have our destination.

                    LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (confused)
          Major, with respect, we're
          obligated to stop. As you are
          merely a passenger, I'm not sure I
          comprehend your position.

Unable to reveal anything, Roy turns away as Tanner looks
through flight information:

                    ALAN TANNER
          The craft is registered as
          Norwegian, the Vesta Nine, orbiting
          asteroid Toro. Registered for
          biomedical research.

On another screen: A scan of the Vesta IX appears.    And on
another SCREEN, ship schematics.

                    LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (INTO COMMS)
          Vesta Nine, do you read, over?

Still nothing. Roy looks at a screen for information.    Eyes
the SCHEMATICS for the VESTA NINE.

                     LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Vesta Nine, according to the Outer
          Space Treaty we are responding to
          your distress call.
              (beat)
          Do you read?
ROY OVERHEARS:

                    ALAN TANNER
          I just accessed their log. Last
          transmission was Sept. 17, 13:37
          PM.

                     LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (to Command)
          Command, I'm going EVA. Possible
          forced entry required.
              (to Roy)
          You're the only non-essential
          member of this craft. As you know,
          protocol is for you to come along.
              (beat)
          Will this be a problem?
                                                            51.


Roy thinks for a moment, then, with thinly-veiled anger, he
starts to suit up.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - EQUIPMENT SECTION

Roy and Blunt strap on equipment and make final suit
augmentations for their EVA. Roy SEES Blunt is ARMING A
WEAPON, a GUNLIKE object.

                    LAWRENCE BLUNT
              (stares at Roy for an
               uncomfortable moment;
               then:)
          I'd advise you to arm yourself as
          well. You're no longer in a
          predictable environment.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
              (curt)
          I'm aware of that.

Frustrated, Roy turns, looks through GLASS to SEE: the Vesta
IX, about the size of the Cepheus, slowly rolling in place.
We hear Donald Scobee from the cockpit...

                     DONALD SCOBEE (RADIO FILTER) (V.O.)
          Heading three-three-four. Cannot
          confirm live contact. Range three-
          zero-seven-zero meters and closing.
              (beat)
          Reactor is still hot.
              (beat)
          Optimum approach angle, thirteen
          degrees. Coming around to three-
          three-four.
Blunt leads Roy towards the hatch...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

Roy and Blunt stand before the airlock doors... which open
into space.

Out they go...


EXT. THE CEPHEUS

A few glittering LIGHTS distinguish the Cepheus from absolute
darkness.

Roy and Blunt jet towards the Vesta IX.
                                                         52.


EXT. SPACE

They venture away from the Cepheus and frighteningly into
deep space. The Vesta is still distressingly far...

And yet, the Vesta gets closer...

And closer...


EXT. VESTA IX

And then they are upon it! Roy reaches the airlock first.
He PUNCHES BUTTONS on the DOORFRAME, to no avail. STATIC
NOISE. Blunt motions to Roy, who uses a GATLING GUN to blow
open the airlock. In SILENCE.


INT. VESTA IX - AIRLOCK

Roy and Blunt enter the craft, pulse weapons at the ready.
No one's in sight.

                       DONALD SCOBEE (V.O.)
             Gentlemen, one of you is required
             to find the flight recorder box.

Blunt points to Roy, and he and Roy move in different
directions...


INT. VESTA IX - DECK

Roy floats through the craft--it's vacant, jammed with idle
instruments, empty console chairs. It's quiet, except for an
electrical HUM. We HEAR:
                       CAPTAIN LAWRENCE BLUNT (V.O.)
             Vesta, this is Cepheus, responding
             to your mayday signal... Do you
             read...?

The ZERO GRAVITY renders a lot of things floating: PENCILS,
NOTEBOOKS, EQUIPMENT, LIT FLASHLIGHTS. They spin in the
craft.


INT. VESTA IX - LAB

Roy floats deeper into the craft. It's dark. Roy scans his
TRACKING DEVICE from side to side. The SPINNING FLASHLIGHTS
illuminate spots for brief moments. Roy grabs one as it
moves.
                                                           53.

By the looks of the LAB EQUIPMENT, it appears the craft
performs research on viruses and diseases.

Roy continues...


INT. VESTA IX - PASSAGEWAY

Roy MOVES towards an OPENING that leads to a DECK.   LIGHTS
are coming from that area.


INT. VESTA IX - ANOTHER DECK

Much CLUTTER here, lots of ITEMS floating around.

Roy moves silently. A SCREEN COMES ON. A bearded man,
grizzly and haunted. A NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT:

                    NORWEGIAN ASTRONAUT
          This is a eulogy for 12 good men...
          Men who came to space to advance
          scientific understanding of the
          universe. But... Our supply
          generator has failed... We can no
          longer see the earth--and it is not
          visible from our current
          perspective... No more earth. And
          we are adrift, without purpose...
          With no hope in sight, we have
          decided to do the only logical
          thing...

Then: something weird... CRIMSON ORBS are floating here and
there. There must be at least a dozen. Most are baseball-
sized, some are larger, some smaller.

ROY touches one. Liquid. He removes his finger, the orb
divides into smaller orbs.

Then--

Something else is FLOATING TOWARDS US...   A larger MASS...
ROY backs up--

AND bumps into a BODY.

A dead body.   He is startled.   Roy pushes past them.

MORE DEAD bodies ahead.

One body leaks BLOOD, which bubbles out of the man's torn
suit, up, down and around, in every direction, forming the
crimson orbs.
                                                                 54.

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             Cepheus, I have one expired
             individual here, no signs of anyone
             alive. I believe I've viewed a
             suicide video file of some kind.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             Copy that, Major. Uh, Major, we've
             momentarily lost contact with
             Captain Blunt here.

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             Appears I have as well.    Will
             attempt eye contact.


INT. VESTA IX - B-DECK

Roy is in the aft of the ship and is DOWNLOADING information
from a central computer shaft. PULLS OUT a BLACK BOX from
the console.

A small LIGHT on Roy's tracker FLASHES.

                         ROY MCBRIDE (RADIO FILTER)
             Captain?

No ANSWER.

Roy tenses, looks around.      Starts to float in that direction.

Roy moves between cramped rows of SHADOWED EQUIPMENT.

There's MOVEMENT in front of him.      He hesitates.    Then,
another shadowy movement...
                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
             Captain Blunt?

Again, no answer!       Roy RAISES HIS WEAPON.   MOVES FORWARD TO
REVEAL:


AROUND THE CORNER:

We SEE a truly GROTESQUE SIGHT: a BABOON DEVOURING CAPTAIN
BLUNT'S FACE!

It's a big one, a Chacma, close to 100 pounds.        It's insane
and hungry.

Roy jumps back, beyond startled.
                                                         55.

ROY'S P.O.V. -- The baboon SEES ROY, SHRIEKS (LOUDLY--but
SILENT TO US because of our helmeted P.O.V.). It knocks over
some equipment as it swims toward us in the gravity-free
space, floating towards ROY'S jugular.

BANG! ROY KILLS THE PRIMATE WITH HIS WEAPON.

It TUMBLES AWAY, dead.

Roy comes over to help. He looks in what remains of Blunt's
eyes. The pupils are not dilating. Roy PUNCHES a BUTTON on
the SIDE OF HIS HELMET. OUT OF BREATH:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             Cepheus, a research primate has
             attacked the captain. He's
             critically injured. Suggest
             retrieving the VDR and moving the
             Captain to the Cepheus as soon as
             possible. Please advise.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             We confirm, this is our view as
             well. Over.

Just then: A RUSH OF MONKEYS APPEARS, CHARGING AT ROY. HE
PULLS HIMSELF BACK, through an AIRLOCK, YANKING the SMALL
BLACK DATA BOX as well as BLUNT inside. Just in time, too,
as the MONKEYS SLAM into the AIRLOCK DOOR. Insanity.


INT. AIRLOCK - VESTA

Roy pulls out a HELMET from a ROW of them, inside the
airlock. Locking it into place on Blunt, placing carefully
it over Blunt's BLOODIED FACE.

EXT. SPACE

Roy and his cord--pulling the black box as well as an
inanimate Blunt--move back to the Cepheus.


EXT. CEPHEUS

As Roy approaches, the Cepheus is SPINNING. He gets to the
surface of the craft, waits until the AIRLOCK DOOR
approaches.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

The airlock doors whoosh open, and Roy rockets in with the
                                                          56.

equipment and Blunt's body on a tether cord. The doors close
behind him. He takes off his helmet. Yoshida helps him/them
through the airlock; PULLING OFF BLUNT'S HELMET, he's
horrified to see what's become of his Commander. Yoshida
begins immediately to work on Blunt. Roy is out of breath.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
              (to Roy)
          What the hell happened in there?!?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          It was a scientific vessel--they
          lost control somehow.
              (with gritted teeth)
          I tried to tell the Captain... ALL
          of you.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Tell us what?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          That we have a task in front of us.
          And that to stop would be a waste
          of fucking time.

Yoshida goes back to work on the unresponsive Blunt. Leaning
his HEAD IN through the corrugated arch, ALAN TANNER reaches
for the BLACK BOX. He pulls it toward him. Then, sotto:

                    ALAN TANNER
              (re: Blunt)
          What's his status?

Yoshida SIMPLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.   The CAPTAIN WON'T MAKE IT.

                    ALAN TANNER (CONT'D)
          I'll inform Don, he'll have to be
          certified for flight.

As Tanner PULLS the black box, Roy follows him into:


INT. COMMAND MODULE - MOMENTS LATER

Tanner begins to draw on the BLACK BOX data. Scobee is going
through his checklist, comparing it the BLACK BOX DATA that
is coming in on the computer. Roy moves closer.

The RADIO INTERRRUPTS:

                    SPACECOM VOICE
          Cepheus, we received your message
          concerning Captain Blunt. We have
          Cpt.
                    (MORE)
                                                        57.

                       SPACECOM VOICE (CONT'D)
             Scobee's retinal scan on file, and
             he is now in control of the craft.
             Over.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             This is Cpt. Scobee, SpaceCom.
             Roger that. Over.

Sotto, to Scobee, Roy grabs Scobee's arm:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             Mars is our assigned destination.
             That is what requires our complete
             focus.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             Understood, Major. We're on our
             way to Helios Station.
                 (louder; to Tanner)
             Prepare boosters D-6, D-9.

                       ALAN TANNER
             Boosters D-6 and D-9, roger that.

Roy HEARS something.    Turns back to SEE:


INT. NEAR AIRLOCK

The life is leaving Blunt. ROY can SEE the BODY, ENTOMBED
inside his SPACESUIT. Yoshida finishes reading LAST RITES:

                       FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
             ...I commend you to almighty God,
             and entrust you to your Creator.
             May the angels and the saints come
             to meet you, as you go forth from
             this life. May you see your
             Redeemer face to face and enjoy the
             vision of God for ever...
                 (to the men)
             Airlock engaged.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             Airlock engaged, roger that.

The AIRLOCK opens.    A WHOOOSH!


EXT. SPACE

THE CEPHEUS RELEASES BLUNT'S BODY into the VOID...
                                                           58.


Their fallen commander tumbles away, into the darkness. The
Cepheus' BOOSTER ROCKETS FIRE, and the CRAFT speeds away--
leaving Blunt's body to tumble. Forever...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. MARS - LATER

The RED PLANET, floating in space. A space elevator with a
SPINNING DOCKING STATION is tethered to the planet.

The Cepheus ARRIVES into view, its retros thrusting.


INT. CEPHEUS

The men speak:

                    DONALD SCOBEE
              (to radio)
          SpaceCom, we are approaching Mars,
          Helios North. Over.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE SPACE ELEVATOR

It slows to a stop as it DOCKS with THE DOCKING BAY connected
to MARS.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

As Roy, Tanner, Scobee, and Yoshida ready themselves to
leave: A DOWNLOAD COMMENCES.
                    SPACECOM VOICE
          Cepheus, this is SpaceCom. We have
          a secure download for passenger Roy
          McBride.

                    DONALD SCOBEE
          Send it through. Over.

The FILE DOWNLOADS.   Roy takes the chip and:


INT. SECURE CORNER

Roy downloads the chip:
                                                          59.


                       SPACECOM VOICE
             An additional message was sent to
             the moon's communications center,
             approximately seven hours after
             your departure.

ROY FOCUSES. On a SCREEN comes: THE IMAGES OF THE MEDIEVAL
CASTLE THAT ROY has OBSESSED OVER! The MUSIC is odd, a
strange "easy listening" tune...

ROY MOVES CLOSE TO THE SCREEN. Then, the IMAGERY CUTS OUT,
leaving a TEXT SENTENCE, white TEXT on BLACK SCREEN:

"ARE YOU COMING?"

NEW LINE of TEXT:

"06:10:00"

ANGLE ON ROY as we:

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. DOCKING AREA - CEPHEUS

Roy SHAKES the hands of Scobee and Yoshida and Tanner:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             My condolences for Captain Blunt,
             gentlemen. I do appreciate the
             ride and wish you the best on the
             rest of your journeys.

                       DONALD SCOBEE
             Thank you, Major. Glad we could be
             of service...

The HATCH OPENS for ROY, and he glides through.


INT. SHUTTLE

Roy is in the shuttle to Helios South.


INT. DOCKING BAY - MOMENTS LATER

He enters the docking bay of the space station. Nobody's
here to greet him, although there are cameras and active
screens. BEEEEP! ROY SPEAKS:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             McBride, Roy C. Submit.
                                                           60.


Steps forward and puts his eye in the scanner.

                      WOMAN ON A SCREEN
          Approved.

A moment, then a WHOOSH!   A LARGE DOOR OPENS TO:


INT. SPACE ELEVATOR

The CREW, entering in the elevator. Roy looks out, SEEING
THE RED PLANET'S SURFACE APPROACHING as the thing descends.


INT. HELIOS STATION - MARS SURFACE

The ELEVATOR "lands" on MARS. The LARGE STEEL DOOR UNLOCKS
AUTOMATICALLY. ROY steps out.

We don't see any people here yet. But several SIBERIAN
HUSKIES walk up and down the halls of the installation.   A
couple of them come up to our men and sniff around.

A weird SCREECHING sound pervades--as if something large deep
inside the station needs repair...or, at the very least,
WD40.

THEN: A FEW SCIENTISTS staggering down the hall, too--SINGING
some unknown song badly, somewhat drunkenly. A GUY IN ROLLER-
SKATES speeds past in the background.

A SEEMINGLY INSANE MARS OFFICER, a woman of fifty, charges to
Roy:

                    MARS OFFICER
          Did you bring us seeds?!? What
          about canned produce, did you do
          THAT?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No. I'm sorry. I don't have any.
          Sorry... Is your commanding
          officer--

Roy looks past her. It's MADNESS. More passersby, more
revelry... and the return of the Roller-Skater.

Next comes an unctuous officer named SERGEANT PETER BELLO
(fiftysomething, strangely tan) greets our man. He may not
be drunk, but it's unclear if he has his wits about him.

                    SGT. BELLO
              (with a slightly mad grin,
               too loud at times)
                    (MORE)
                                                           61.

                    SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
          Good afternoon! Or evening--or
          whatever the fuck! WELCOME TO THE
          VERY LAST MANNED OUTPOST IN OUR
          SOLAR SYSTEM! [I'm] Sergeant
          Bello... You comin' from earth, or
          the moon??? OR WHAT?!? Wait,
          whose retinal scan'd I approve?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I've been sent by SpaceCom to
          conduct an inspection near Vallis
          Marineris and I need access to the
          location as soon as possible. I
          need to see a Colonel Lipset.

                    SGT. BELLO
          Oh, I bet he's at Shunga Show,
          brother! Where we should be! Keep
          ourselves right in the head--and
          down BELOW, if you get my meaning--

ROY INTERRUPTS him.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I need to talk to him.   It's
          urgent.

                    SGT. BELLO
          Okay, cowboy... Okay...


INT. HELIOS STATION - SHUNGA PARLOR

An enormous dark space, almost like the Whale Room in New
York's American Museum of Natural History. It's lit only by
black light.

PROJECTED ALL OVER, we SEE...several physically perfect
STRIPPERS (holographic--but also totally lifelike).

ROY joins the throng of SCIENTISTS & MILITARY.   EVERYONE is
SMOKING POT and doing a lot of other stuff.

Roy walks through some of the strippers.

                    SGT. BELLO
              (excitedly)
          They keep us company! Don't
          misunderstand me, we're not
          allowed't make `em sentient,
          course. But our scientists here've
          tampered with `em--given `em a
          little more personality, we'll say!
                    (MORE)
                                                         62.

                    SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
          They're still well within legal
          A.I. cognition limits, I promise
          you!

Roy looks around him at a couple of gorgeous (fake) women,
GYRATING IN UNISON to "TALKIN' LOUD AND SAYIN' NOTHING".

Roy SEES a LARGE BUFFET TABLE with PROCESSED FOOD.

The virtual HOLO WOMEN move around Roy like ghosts.

It's James Brown night, evidently. The Godfather of Soul is
actually here in person, "on stage"--a perfect, life-like
hologram.

Roy's sort of pushing the Holo Women away, like swatting
flies. His hand just goes through them. Roy and the rest of
the crew encounter:

Sitting on a cushion, smoking a BONG and working on God-knows-
what with old-fashioned pencil and paper, is astrophysicist
SAMIR MALIK--bearded, thirtysomething, bespectacled,
hippyish. A shit-eating grin. HIS WIFE, CHERYL, is next to
him. Projected around them is a WARM SPACE, almost like a
high-end LOG CABIN. STANDING NEARBY: COLONEL LIPSET, a
grizzled man, about forty-five years old. Lined face, gaunt.
He STARES AT ROY...

                    SGT. BELLO (CONT'D)
          Sam, this guy's got orders, from
          SpaceCom. Looking for a Colonel
          Lipset.

Malik smiles broadly, holds out a hand to shake Roy's.
COMPLETELY STONED. His hand is robotic, a metallic gold (for
no explained reason).
                    SAMIR MALIK
          Samir Malik--I'm superintendant.
          With National Institute of
          Sciences. Cal-Tech Mafia! This's
          my wife, Cheryl.

                    CHERYL
          Pleased to meet you.

                    SAMIR MALIK
              (with a snort)
          Well, it's a pleasure to meet
          anybody this far out--'specially
          anybody with their heads screwed on
          straight! END of the LINE here!
                                                           63.


Awkward pause, the MEN LOOK AROUND at the surroundings.
COLONEL LIPSET is still staring. Then:

                    SAMIR MALIK (CONT'D)
              (lets out a laugh)
          Gotta maintain that human
          connection somehow...

The OFFICER REACHES DOWN to a METAL PLANK below his feet and
FLIPS a SWITCH. OFF GOES the HOLOGRAPHIC ROOM AROUND THEM,
that "HIGH-END LOG CABIN", revealing the real space around
them. Stepping forward is Colonel Lipset:

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Major, I'm Colonel Lipset.

                        ROY MCBRIDE
          Sir.   YES.

As COLONEL LIPSET MOVES to shake Roy's hand, he LEANS IN,
softly into Roy's EAR:

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          I've been fully briefed.

Straightening up, and louder:

                        ROY MCBRIDE
          Yessir.

Roy turns, HANDS LIPSET A PRINTOUT.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          My destination is these
          coordinates.
                     COLONEL LIPSET
              (looks, then to Malik)
          Dr. Malik?

MALIK LOOKS AT IT, then UP AT THEM, LIKE ROY'S NUTS.   Grows
DEADLY SERIOUS.   Turns to his wife:

                    SAMIR MALIK
          Honey, I've gotta go back to work.
              (back to Roy)
          Why don't you take a ride with me.


INT. HELIOS CORRIDOR - MONORAIL

ROY, SAMIR MALIK in a SPEEDING MONORAIL. A LIT MAP IS IN
FRONT OF THEM. With Malik is his right-hand, a woman named
KATHRYN COLLINS. COLONEL LIPSET is with them, SILENT.
                                                         64.


                    SAMIR MALIK
          The spot is in the middle of our
          complex of fission reactors. It's
          a Westinghouse design, built--I
          wanna say six earth years ago?

He looks to Collins:

                    KATHRYN COLLINS
          That's right.

                    SAMIR MALIK
          Right. Well, there was a meltdown
          in reactor three a few months after
          completion. Likely a result of
          industrial sabotage.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          What's its current status?

                    SAMIR MALIK
          Kathryn knows more than I do here.

Roy TURNS TO THE MAP IN FRONT OF THEM as it scrolls up to the
northern hemisphere, then stops. Like Google Maps' "Street
View"--a remote camera has captured the exterior of a Martian
REACTOR. Roy studies the location.

Collins points to the map, which shows a "skeleton" of the
reactor's innards.

                    KATHRYN COLLINS (CONT'D)
          This area was walled-off after the
          disaster. They poured concrete to
          prevent further contamination. And
          many of the tunnels are still
          filled with cooling water.

Roy is studying images of a large TELESCOPE ARRAY near the
reactor in Valles Marineris.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          What is that, to the right?

                    KATHRYN COLLINS
          A radio telescope. Still active.
          Which is why we're continuing to
          pump electricity, water, and oxygen
          through the reactor. No one'll
          spend the money to build a new
          telescope away from the
          contaminated area, and it needs
          those things to operate.
                                                           65.


                    ROY MCBRIDE
          So this whole zone is deserted now--
          but it still has power, that's what
          I'm to understand?

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          That is correct, major.

Everyone falls silent.   Lipset's interjection is odd.   Then:

                    KATHRYN COLLINS
          SPACECOM's using Cornell University
          to do an ongoing study of the
          disaster. One of their fellows's
          named Francesca DeSanctis. She's
          their point person.

As Roy sifts through the reactor scans:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I'd like to debrief her--if that's
          okay with you.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          We'll get her to you.

A TENSE BEAT.   Then:

                    SAMIR MALIK
          Anything we should know here?

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          I'm sorry, Doctor--how do you mean?

                    SAMIR MALIK
              (looks to Collins, then)
          Well...we had a power surge, couple
          of weeks ago, and we had a lot of
          repair work on our hands.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          I seem to recall reading that
          quakes happen here from time to
          time, maybe that was the cause.

                     SAMIR MALIK
          They do, but...
              (beat; shrugs)
          Look, we've heard rumors. About an
          explosion, off Neptune.
              (beat)
          I guess I'm wondering--should
          we...evacuate?
                                                             66.


Colonel Lipset looks to Roy, who responds "properly":

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          The mission's classified, I'm
          sorry.

Malik purses his lips.   Not the most encouraging answer.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Please find the woman.

INT. THE HELIOS - CHAPEL/LAB - CONTINUOUS

What was once solely a chapel has been converted to a lab
mixed with a weird version of a 1960's hippy ashram.
Blankets, lamps, etc. A WOMAN whose back is to us.

                    SAMIR MALIK
          Her name is Francesca DeSanctis--
          she was born here. She's part of
          the Cornell Extension program and
          had been working on the Mars
          geology project. So she's been
          researching the territory for
          years.

A CLOSE SHOT on FRANCESCA DESANCTIS, early forties, as she
turns around to us. Lovely but also fragile. Not physically
delicate, but somehow, we can tell she's emotionally
vulnerable. She is whiter than white--as if her skin has
never seen sunlight. Veins are visible beneath her temples.

She looks into the camera, then STANDS UP, walks toward us as
ROY ENTERS.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Hello.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Good evening.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
              (wide smile)
          Or morning.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
              (gentle smile in return)
          Right, yes.
              (beat)
          I'm from USSPACECOM, and I have
          some questions for you.
                                      67.

             FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
All right.

          ROY MCBRIDE
I ask you not to be concerned, I
just need to know what you know--

          FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
    (interrupting)
I'm not concerned.

          ROY MCBRIDE
Okay, that's good... Dr. Malik
informs me that you've been
studying the reactors?

           FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Yes. For about four years now, for
a SPACECOM study. I toured the
area myself before a series of
quakes hit the area. I was the
last to enter.
    (wry smile)
I guess I'm the lucky one.
    (beat)
All my records are on file, and I
have adhered most strictly to all
regulations. My scientific work is
very important. It's, it's what I
have.

          ROY MCBRIDE
    (nods; then)
You haven't noticed anything
unusual inside the reactors?

          FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
Apart from the physical activity?

          ROY MCBRIDE
What do you mean?

          FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
I informed SPACECOM about signs of
a physical disturbance inside the
reactor. Didn't they tell you?

          ROY MCBRIDE
    (thrown)
No...I, I have no information on
that matter...
                                                          68.


                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Well, it's my feeling that a person
          has been inside the core. I've
          noticed what I think are some very
          obvious signs.

ROY IS STUNNED.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          I can take you down there--if, if
          that's where you need to go. I
          know the routes and I can help.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
               (cutting her off)
          Thank you. I think I have enough
          information for now. I'll contact
          you.

INT. HELIOS CONFERENCE ROOM

Roy and Colonel Lipset are huddling.   Lipset looks at DATA
PAPERS. In medias res:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I do believe now it's possible that
          my father escaped from Neptune,
          yes. In a craft of some sort,
          perhaps--something of 3-D
          fabrication. We'd have to find out
          where he's hiding here on Mars,
          course.
                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Either that, or it's not him.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Sir, with respect, there's no one
          else who had knowledge of the
          things that have been sent to me.
          It is him.

Lipset looks up.   A beat.   Then:

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          No one's been inside there for
          years. We don't know what's down
          there.
                    (MORE)
                                                         69.

                    COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
          It could be extremely dangerous--
          the radiation, the, the self-
          replicators may still be active.
          And you don't know the
          way--

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          I would go with Ms. DeSanctis. She
          would guide me to the location and
          I could then initiate the contact
          with my father. I would set her
          free and convince him to surrender.
          You'd have continued access to my
          data, and you could speak with me
          directly through my MMU.
              (beat)
          This is the necessary mission, sir.
          And time is critical.

Lipset begins to BURN the DATA PAPERS.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          We'll have to follow you close
          behind, ready to move and hopefully
          obtain intel on the Lima Project's
          precise location off Neptune.

Roy LOOKS TROUBLED.    DOES NOT SPEAK UP.

                    COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
          Is this a problem for you?

                       ROY MCBRIDE
              (beat)
          No sir...
                     COLONEL LIPSET
          Good.   Because we're only here to
          help.

INT. HELIOS PREPARATION ROOM

Francesca is getting a SPACESUIT put on her. She's rarely
had one on before; it looks awkward, almost preposterous, on
her. She's older than Roy; she is lovely in her
vulnerability. Incredibly aware and sensitive eyes--as well
as a seemingly easygoing manner:
                                                        70.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Are you uncomfortable with the
          unit, Ma'am?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          I've grown up with these but I've
          never liked them.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          This one's considerably better than
          the earlier models. I've noticed
          increased flexibility with the
          newer MMUs. They have all our
          vitals here. And you can release
          all the nitrogen fuel at once, if
          you need to, from the pack or even
          from your boots, here.
              (beat; senses her stress)
          If you breathe normally, there's no
          cause for panic.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          That's what I try to do.
              (smiles)
          "Breathe," I tell myself. It
          should be easy. It probably is,
          for you.

She accepts that. Roy REACHES for a SMALL ELECTRONIC FLAT
SCREEN, which he unfolds:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Is this map accurate?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
              (nods; then)
          Yes. But when we get there,
          there's also a guide rope that we
          installed through the tunnels right
          after meltdown. It leads to the
          center of the core.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          Okay...
              (beat)
          And--and thank you, Ma'am. You can
          rest assured that this is of great
          importance, what you're doing. For
          the Earth.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
              (nods; then)
          I've only been to earth once,
          actually. As a child.
                    (MORE)
                                                             71.

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
           I have a tissue disorder because I
           was born here. They said I'd die
           if I tried going back, through the
           radiation belt. But they're working
           on new medications.

Unexpectedly, she stops speaking.     Looks at Roy.   Her EYES
WELL UP:

                      FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
           I remember it very well--I
           remember, it was extremely
           beautiful.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           Some parts, yes.
               (lets out a laugh)
           Other parts...not so much.

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
               (interior)
           I wish I could be there...I wish,
           more than anything else...
               (louder; eases)
           A lot of people here get lonely.
           And they break down. The mental
           hospital at Helios is always full
           of patients.
               (sotto; looks at the map)
           It's why I always thought the
           reactor crew itself caused the
           meltdown. I think they just lost
           it...

A beat.   She seems to get an idea:
                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
           Hey, I think I saw a news program
           on you, from a few years back. I
           just realized, I think I know you!

ROY IS MOMENTARILY CONFUSED:

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
           It was--it was about the Space
           Antenna!

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           Oh yes, the gravitational wave
           antenna. It's almost finished now.
           It's going to be an excellent
           project. We'll be able to hear any
           intelligent life, possibly even
           respond.
                                                            72.

                       FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
             Maybe I'll be able to go to the
             Earth and see it someday...

                        ROY MCBRIDE
             Yes, it will be completed soon.
             Our team was really working toward
             that. All of us, back home. It's
             a very worthy endeavor--
             communication with other potential
             lifeforms.

DeSanctis looks at her suit.    Then:

                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
             I think you're ready.

A BUTTON on Francesca's SUIT is PUSHED and it COLLAPSES
AROUND HER, SNUG. She looks uncomfortable--but ready. Roy
SMILES at her; he's comfortable. There's even a level of
sexual attraction, maybe. Maybe. Roy talks to his sleeve:

                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
             Doctor, Colonel--I think we're good
             to go here.

ANGLE ON ROY as he LOOKS UP. THROUGH GLASS, we SEE: SAMIR
MALIK and COLONEL LIPSET looking at them.

                                                     CUT TO:


INT. UNDERGROUND STATION

A maze-like installation.    A ROVER about to depart.


INT. ROVER

In the ROVER are Roy and Francesca.     With KATHRYN COLLINS
driving.


EXT. MARS - SHUTTLE PORT - DAY

The ground opens up and the rover emerges onto the strikingly
bright Martian terrain.


EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - LATER

The rover drives alongside one of Mars's monumental canyons,
VALLES MARINERIS. It's amazing.
                                                            73.


INT. ROVER

A wonder to behold.     ALL DIALOG IS RADIO FILTER:

                       FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
             That is Valles Marineris, over to
             your right--it's a thousand times
             bigger than the Grand Canyon on
             earth. And just about every other
             month an earthsick person throws
             himself off it.


INT./EXT. FRONT ROVER - CONTINUOUS

Francesca DeSanctis gestures to a large structure that
they're about to pass.

                       FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
             The area we're entering was self-
             sufficient at one time, with a
             greenhouse and self-replicating
             units for maintenance and repair.
                 (to Collins)
             You can take us right to that white
             circle, Kathryn.

                        KATHRYN COLLINS
             Will do.

Collins pulls the rover over to the side of the road, near a
WHITE STEEL CIRCLE TUBE in the dirt--about 10 feet in
diameter. Roy leans forward. To Collins:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             I have activated GPS so you can
             find us. When we're done. It
             reports that we have twenty-six
             minutes until we need to be inside.

                       KATHRYN COLLINS
             Roger that. We'll be more than
             happy to come pick you up on our
             Mars Taxi service!
                 (no answer from Roy, so)
             Good luck, both of you!


EXT. MARS - VALLES MARINERIS - CONTINUOUS

The rover's doors open.     Roy steps out.

Roy and Francesca are left all alone as the Rover leaves
behind a trail of dust.
                                                          74.


It's silent. The landscape is mostly barren--the greenhouse,
the radio telescope, and a few other structures are in the
distance.

A purple DUST STORM materializes, gathers, grows, approaches.

The atmosphere is obscured.

Luckily, the atmosphere is so thin that these twisters are
harmless--they just leave a RED/VIOLET HUE over Roy's and
Francesca's spacesuit and helmet.

Francesca finds a HATCH, covered in dust and dirt. POINTS TO
ROY. Roy bends down, shoves the dirt away and find a metal
protuberance. After removing more dirt, he is ABLE TO LIFT
UP THE HATCH.

DOWN THEY GO, INTO AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER.


INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER

A CONCRETE SARCOPHAGUS. A WALL. With a CIRCULAR WHEEL,
leading DOWNWARD. FRANCESCA GESTURES.

ROY TURNS THE WHEEL.   It opens, and they descend into the
DARK WATER:


INT. TUNNELS

THEY ARE NOW SWIMMING in a TUNNEL of DARKNESS. Roy and
Francesca have HELMET LIGHTS which illuminate a few feet in
front of them.

They PULL THEMSELVES ALONG by the GUIDE ROPE.
ROY'S SLEEVE BLINKS: "EXCESSIVE RADIATION"


INT. DEEPER INTO THE TUNNELS

They are dark.

Only a few feet in front of Roy is illuminated.

THE TWO PULL THEMSELVES ALONG THE ROPE SLOWLY and CAREFULLY.
INTO THE DARKNESS.

But then we see the movement of particulate in the air.
Something is causing dust to disperse in that DARK TUNNEL...

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Something appears to be moving.
                                                            75.


The breaths quicken.

TERROR on her face.    He looks down the pipeway; he can focus
on nothing else...

SOMETHING begins to appear in the darkness...

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          I just received a text message,
          imploring us not to proceed. It
          says if we do we will be
          destroyed...

SLOWLY BUT SURELY we begin to make it out...

It is a creaturelike SELF-REPLICATING MACHINE.

We've SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT before; they were working on the
tether, in the beginning of our story. But this one is
larger, somehow more unforgiving. Its HEAD is ONE HEADLIGHT;
the head looks like Odilon Redon's portrait of the CYCLOPS...

It charges at them in silence, through the dense water. It
appears to be WELDING--it has TENDRILS, like a HYDRA, which
it uses to push itself down the TUNNEL.

It gets CLOSER AND CLOSER!

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Please send it code, tell it that
          we'll proceed no further and it
          need not be concerned.

She is typing into her sleeve.   A TENDRIL REACHES OUT about
to GRAB FRANCESCA.
AND THEN IT STOPS.    STOPS PROCEEDING.

Roy steps forward. Approaches the enormous hydra, which
seems frozen and no longer threatening.

AT INCREDIBLE SPEED, he withdraws his PULSE WEAPON, FIRES AT
IT. DIRECT HIT!

It moves spasmodically for a moment after it is hit--almost
as if in physical pain.

ROY APPROACHES IT, CLOSE, FIRING THE PULSE WEAPON to the
CENTER of the EYE of the HEAD...

THE HYDRA JERKS SPASMODICALLY AGAIN.

ROY then GRABS FRANCESCA'S ARM; REACHES OVER and PULLS on
what LOOKS LIKE A RIPCORD of sorts from his MMU.
                                                           76.


THE MMU on ROY'S BACK RELEASES ALL THE NITROGEN in the PACK,
YANKING HER and ROY with TREMENDOUS SPEED PAST THE DESTROYED
HYDRA; they TUMBLE THROUGH THE WATER, BLOWING away from the
HYDRA and toward relative safety.

ROY finds the CABLE, and, holding onto FRANCESCA, he uses her
own MMU for power.


INT. TUNNEL AIRLOCK

The TWO ENTER:

Francesca leads him.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
              (to radio)
          Command, it appears we encountered
          a self-replicator of some kind,
          perhaps one meant to secure the
          structure.

                    COMMAND VOICE
          Copy that, Major. Is it still
          active?

                       ROY MCBRIDE
          Negative.     It has been disabled.

                    COMMAND VOICE
          All right, proceed to the core.
          You have twelve minutes until you
          reach the time indicated.


INT. DIFFERENT TUNNEL
The two enter a long, BLUE-LIGHT TUNNEL.    After a few steps,
Roy stops. Something's wrong:

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Major?   Are you all right?

A beat.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          My pulse is getting a little more
          rapid here.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Mine is as well. We didn't expect
          to encounter that.
                    (MORE)
                                                        77.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          The unit was perhaps agitated by
          the recent quake--disoriented by
          having to operate alone.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          No...Ma'am--that's, that's not it.
          Situations of that nature don't
          present difficulties for me.
              (checks his numbers)
          And this is indicating that my
          metabolic levels are increasing
          only now, as we approach the core.
              (beat; to himself)
          I, I have to address this...

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Should we wait to enter?
              (beat)
          Perhaps you're getting anxious
          about what you'll find there--

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (interrupts)
          No. We must enter the core.


INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

They MOVE THROUGH the corridor to:


INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - THE CORE

A massive chamber. Roy and Francesca come ACROSS THE
ENORMOUS BASE of the REACTOR. A FLICKERING SERIES of
FLUORESCENT LIGHTS illuminate HALF the ROOM. It looks almost
lived-in, frozen in time. Like there should be half-drunk
cups of coffee on the consoles.

Francesca DeSanctis's back is to ROY.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Is this it, Ma'am?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Yes.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          All right. Ma'am, I have to inform
          you, I've got an operation I need
          to conduct shortly, and it's
          classified. So...you're not going
          to be able to remain here.
                    (MORE)
                                                           78.

                       ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.

She LIFTS THE HELMET OFF HER HEAD.    We STARE FOR A BEAT at
the BACK OF HER HEAD.   Then:

                      ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Ma'am?    Did you hear what I said?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Did it--ever seem possible that you
          might find out something about
          yourself? Something that might--
          change you?

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I don't know exactly what you're
          referring to. As I said, I have
          some objectives, and our
          conversation has to be terminated
          now.

FRANCESCA REACHES OVER, HITS a LARGE KEY on a console. A
RECTANGULAR MONITOR begins to PLAY IMAGES WE'VE SEEN, of the
boy and girl at THE CLOISTERS!

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          It always felt like we were
          destined to meet again. Like it
          was fate.

THIS TIME, we SEE the ENTIRE SET OF IMAGES. A LARGE FAMILY,
at THE CLOISTERS. THE YOUNG BOY is DRAWING for a somewhat
older GIRL. A SMALL PICNIC, or PARTY... AND the GIRL MOVES
to SIT ON...

H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE'S LAP.    The BOY HANDS A DRAWING TO THE
GIRL.

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          It's the only time I saw you, the
          only time I was on earth. But--I
          feel as though I know you so well.
          Your father photographed you a lot
          as a child. And I still look at
          the pictures and the videos all the
          time. So...I feel very connected
          to you.
              (beat)
          I wish you knew about me.

ROY IS FLUSTERED.   FOR THE FIRST TIME in our STORY, HE IS
TRULY THROWN.
                                                            79.

The RADIO begins to SOUND in ROY'S HEAD:

                    COMMAND RADIO
          Major, we are registering her non-
          compliance. We are within ten
          meters, ready to engage.

She TURNS TOWARD HIM and US, HOLDING a BLACK FOLDER in HER
HANDS. She takes a step toward him. He reaches down, toward
his PULSE WEAPON.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Your father was so lonely in his
          travels. He had another life here,
          on Mars. Another family.

She smiles to him, gently--a genuine though somehow
melancholy smile.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          He is my father, too.

FRANCESCA DESANCTIS then PUSHES THE BLACK FOLDER toward ROY.
She FLIPS IT OPEN.

IT IS THE DRAWING THAT THE BOY GAVE THE GIRL in the VIDEO.

ROY LOOKS AT THE DRAWING.    It's incontrovertible.   HE
REALIZES. It's TRUE.

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          He wanted me to reach out to you.
          I was afraid you couldn't be
          trusted at first. But then I lost
          touch with him and when I saw you,
          I knew it was the right thing to
          do.
              (beat)
          I called for you, Roy. The
          messages were from me.

HE APPROACHES the SCREEN. NOW IT IS FOOTAGE OF ROY through
the YEARS, beyond the IMAGES we've seen. HIM AS A TODDLER,
AS A TEEN, AS A CADET. FRANCESCA is NOW BEHIND HIM AGAIN.

                    COMMAND RADIO
          Major, we are ready to intercede.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          What...is it you want from me...?

HIS EYES BEGIN TO WATER.    YES, WE ARE SEEING TEARS BEGIN TO
FORM IN HIS EYES!
                                                             80.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          He needs our help.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (for himself)
          Dr. McBride...abandoned me...

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          Your father went to Neptune to try
          and save us.

Now Francesca, emotional as well, her back to us again:

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          The mission went too far from the
          Earth, and many in the crew went
          insane...
              (over her shoulder, to
               Roy)
          You've seen for yourself how hard
          it becomes when the Earth is no
          longer visible. When they
          attempted their sabotage, he did
          what he had to do to continue on.
              (eyes back down to the
               floor)
          He is a truly great man. He told
          me they found antimatter, that he
          wanted to make it all anew. But
          he's gone silent now. All his
          findings have stopped being sent to
          Earth. I am concerned--I worry for
          him so much...
              (she turns to Roy)
          He needs our help. I can locate
          him. I will give that to you.

Roy STARES AT HER for a MOMENT.   Lost, almost as if he's
short circuited:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I have...my own...directives.

She approaches him:

                     FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          We're his family. He had no way
          back, but maybe you will.
              (beat)
          Please. He needs our help! He
          cared about you, he did. HE LOVED
          YOU, all this time. I know he did--
                                                         81.

HE IS SHAKING. A BEEPING BEGINS; it's his VITALS, on his
SLEEVE. THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL!

She touches his arm with tenderness.

ALL OF A SUDDEN:

The DUCTS SLIDE OPEN. STEPPING IN: TANNER and YOSHIDA, in
their suits. POINTING WEAPONS RIGHT AT HER. The THREAT is
clear. FRANCESCA is startled. To her:

                      ALAN TANNER
          Down!    On your knees! Right now!

Roy begins to approach Francesca. The others intervene. A
CHAOS BUILDS. AS TANNER PULLS OUT a STRANGE CORD:

                    ALAN TANNER (CONT'D)
          We'll handle the interrogation from
          this point forward, Major.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          She--she may well have information
          only I can access here!

                     ALAN TANNER
          Major, you are currently under no
          condition to continue this
          interview.

                    ROY MCRIDE
          That's incorrect. It's imperative
          that you interrogate her with me
          present--

AS TANNER ATTACHES IT TO HER:
                    ALAN TANNER
          Orders are now that you are to
          retrieve all relevant data and
          return to the Cepheus. There is a
          shuttle waiting for you. She'll be
          processed appropriately.

TANNER PULLS HER AWAY. SHE IS YANKED OUT OF THE SPACE, and
as she IS, SHE STARES AT ROY as the two EXIT. Yoshida
remains, with Roy.

Roy MOVES to the CONSOLE, where his FAMILY HISTORY CONTINUES
TO PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM:

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Major, we have to proceed now.
                                                            82.


Roy does not move.    LIKE A SHORT CIRCUIT.

                     FRANKLIN YOSHIDA (CONT'D)
          Major.
              (beat)
          MAJOR.
              (beat)
          YOUR ORDERS ARE TO RETRIEVE THE
          DATA CELLS AND RETURN TO THE
          CEPHEUS.

YOSHIDA DEPARTS. ROY MOVES TO THE CONSOLE and BEGINS TO
REMOVE THE DATA CARD FROM THE BOARD, UNSCREWING THE CARDS.

THE IMAGES OF HIM DISAPPEAR FROM THE SCREEN as he TAKES ALL
THE INTEL HE CAN.


EXT. MARS SURFACE - LATER

ROY EMERGES, boards the automated, driverless GPS-guided
ROVER THAT IS WAITING FOR HIM.


INT. SPACE ELEVATOR

CLOSE ON ROY...in the silent elevator car as it lifts up,
away from Mars.


INT./EXT. DOCKING PLATFORM

Roy ENTERS/FLOATS INTO the DECK, returning from the elevator.
Roy retreats inward at the sight of Colonel Lipset:

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (distant)
          The tasks are completed.
          Everything from the core's system's
          been obtained...

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          I'm sorry, Roy. SPACECOM and I
          felt it necessary to contact your
          associates from your trip to Mars.
          Your behavior with them did cause
          concern. We have fully briefed
          them now.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Concern...?
                                                           83.

                    ALAN TANNER
          You sent data into space. You also
          neglected to take your sedative
          capsule, and you protested the
          response to a standard mayday call.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (sotto)
          You know why I resisted now...

A WARNING LIGHT GOES OFF on the console.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          I'd recommend a sedative for you,
          Major.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          NO. My metabolics will return to
          normal in just a moment. The
          environment on Mars was high-
          stress, and it was a standard
          reaction. I just need to do this--

Roy ATTACHES the DATA BOX to the Cepheus.    DATA BEGINS TO
FLOW from it into the craft's computer.

Yoshida tries to hand Roy a pill and a cup of water.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Major--

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Major, take the sedative--

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.     THIS
          IS MY TASK.

Roy PUSHES THEM AWAY.   Alan Tanner looks to Donald Scobee.

Scobee moves to speak into the console as the Cepheus
DECOUPLES FROM the elevator's docking platform:

                    DONALD SCOBEE
          SpaceCom, we are ready to proceed.

ANGLE ON ROY as he is turned inward.   No eye contact with the
rest of the crew.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Major, I'm going to have to insist.
                                                           84.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (to Colonel Lipset)
          What--was the result of your
          interrogation of Ms. DeSanctis?

The men have no reaction at first.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Did you gain any further
          information from her?

Then, without a word, LIPSET REACHES OVER and PRESSES a
BUTTON ON the CRAFT'S CONSOLE MONITOR. He types in
something, and on comes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IMAGE:

THE SURVEILLANCE IMAGE is of Francesca DeSanctis, seated, in
what looks like a small white room with a dropped ceiling and
fluorescent light. We hear some MURMURING, which is
UNINTELLIGIBLE from her, and from the others who surround
her.

ROY WATCHES, IN TURMOIL.

The MEN who surround her are our team: Lipset, Tanner,
Scobee, Yoshida. They are at moments on, and offscreen,
their backs to us. They appear to be interrogating her.      We
HEAR SNIPPETS.

"What were you doing there...?"

"You are sitting there, without any..."

She isn't looking at them.   Entering the FRAME is LIPSET:

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          LOOK AT US.

After a BEAT:
                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          I won't speak to you until Major
          McBride is here. He needs to be
          present.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Major McBride is not part of this
          particular operation. So you're
          going to need to respond to us--
          right now, Ma'am.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          You don't understand. I am not
          your enemy. You're talking to me
          like I'm your enemy--and I am not.
                                                          85.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          You are admitting that Clifford
          McBride is your father, and you've
          been in contact with him. That's
          correct, is it not?

She stares at Lipset.

                    COLONEL LIPSET (CONT'D)
          You're aware he is posing a
          potentially catastrophic threat?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          I need to see my brother. Major
          McBride.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          WHAT IS THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE
          LIMA PROJECT?

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS
          I need to see my brother.

She STANDS UP. TANNER MOVES BEHIND HER with INCREDIBLE
SPEED. As this is happening--

LIPSET THROWS her BACK, to the CHAIR. VIOLENTLY. But she
still TRIES TO GET UP, so LIPSET SLAPS HER, HARD, ACROSS THE
FACE.

She FLAILS. The MEN CHARGE AT HER, and TANNER PUTS her in a
CHOKEHOLD. Francesca starts to GASP. And SHAKE.

                    FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT'D)
          I--I need help--
                    DONALD SCOBEE
          If you want help, you'll tell us--

Francesca SHAKES VIOLENTLY NOW.   Is it a SEIZURE...?

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          Hold it, hold on there--whoa--

SHE CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND, her body VIBRATING with
uncontrollable force. WEIRDLY QUIET, FAST...

TANNER PUTS HIS KNEE ON HER BACK.   We HEAR the men through
MUFFLED SOUND:

THE IMAGE ENDS.   BACK TO:
                                                          86.

INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

Where the men are now ominously surrounding Roy. Tanner at
the controls, initiating STAGE-1 liftoff away from the dock:

                    ALAN TANNER
          ...Booster looking good at 4
          minutes. Level sense arm at 8 plus
          17; outboard cut-off at 9 plus
          11...

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (disturbed)
          Where--where is she?

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          The subject is dead. She stopped
          breathing and couldn't be revived.
          But we extracted the coordinates of
          the Lima Project transmissions.
          From the Mars reactor data. We
          know where to go.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (interior)
          You...killed her?

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          It was likely some kind of
          congenital disorder.

ROY'S RAGE is building.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Major, your contribution to this
          mission has come to a close.
The ship's STAGE-1 thrusters (minor, low-velocity) are
FIRING, powering the ship away from the Helios's upper
station (the top of the space elevator).

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (reverts to form)
          What's--what's important here
          is...the mission.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          We're appreciative of your
          contributions.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          I have followed orders and
          accomplished my objective.   I need
          to brief SpaceCom.
                                                             87.

                    FRANKLIN YOSHIDA
          SpaceCom's already fully aware of
          the situation. You failed your
          last two psych-evals.

Roy stops himself. He sees them surrounding him.   Scobee is
in front of a control panel.

The Cepheus has reached a safe radius, about a mile away...
So the STAGE-2, high-power rocket thrusters now have room to
fire safely. Tanner initiates Stage-2 procedure, a COUNTDOWN
begins.

The suspense intensifies, and it's eerie, as everyone's just
floating, suspended, waiting...

Roy's FACE GOES WHITE.

                    COLONEL LIPSET
          Major. We don't want to have to
          eliminate you.

Yoshida moves towards Roy.

Yoshida continues forward, towards Roy--Roy's eyes burn with
intensity. Tanner GRASPS his PULSE WEAPON.

It's clear they do want him DEAD. Scobee APPROACHES Roy,
too. Lipset stays back. Just as Scobee is near Roy--

Roy IGNITES his MMU's BOOT JETS, which blow Scobee back
against the opposite wall with such force that Scobee's
KILLED instantly, and he CRUSHES AND KILLS Lipset--behind him-
-as well by the force of his body.

The OTHERS MOVE TO ROY, who--PULLS DOWN on a THRUSTER on the
CONSOLE of the CRAFT.

The ENTIRE CRAFT BEGINS TO REVOLVE, MAKING A FULL REVOLUTION
every SECOND.

The CENTRIFUGAL FORCE PUSHES EVERYTHING to the SIDES of the
craft--all the CLIPBOARDS, FLIGHT PLANS, PENS, PROCEDURE
BOARDS, etc. STICK TO THE WALLS.

The MEN are all SHAKEN up.   Completely DISORIENTED for a
moment.

Tanner is shaken loose and hit hard, but he's only stunned.

By this point, Yoshida ATTACKS Roy with vicious BLOWS.

Roy LURCHES TOWARD the WALL of the CAPSULE; HE PULLS a small,
metal CANNISTER that is strapped to the wall near him.
                                                            88.


He swings the cannister at Yoshida and connects with
Yoshida's skull. Yoshida tumbles away.

Now, it's just Roy and Tanner. Roy is bleeding. Tanner is
holding a PULSE WEAPON. All Roy has is the cannister. But
with the CRAFT SPINNING, it's virtually impossible to AIM.

Tanner pulls the trigger--the weapon BLASTS.

Roy manages to twist out of the way of what was bad aim due
to the spinning. The BLAST barely misses him.

ROY GRABS a PEN from the SIDE OF THE CRAFT.

He STABS YOSHIDA in the NECK. YOSHIDA'S BLOOD BLOOMS.     This
FORMS GLOBULES of BLOOD in the WEIGHTLESSNESS!

Roy uses the moment to EVADE Tanner. Utilizing the
NETTING/WIRING along the side of the ship, Roy scrambles
away.

The SUNLIGHT COMES THROUGH the WINDOWS FLASHES AS FAST AS A
STROBE LIGHT...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Roy moves around a CORNER, disappearing into a DARKER area of
the ship...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT -

Tanner PULLS the REENTRY LEVER over his head. The CRAFT
STOPS SPINNING. HE wraps YOSHIDA'S WOUND with a TOWEL, to
stop the blood. He TURNS BACK AROUND to FOLLOW/KILL ROY.

INT. THE CEPHEUS - ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Tanner pursues Roy.

Tanner presses a BUTTON to OPEN the fairing door, and leans
into that section, when...

Suddenly, Roy emerges from the tangle of WIRES AND OTHER
MATERIAL against the wall where he'd been hiding, and SHOVES
Tanner deep into the fairing section.

And Roy presses the button to CLOSE the fairing section
door. He's trapped Tanner in this part of the ship.
                                                          89.


The Stage-2 COUNTDOWN approaches liftoff, and Roy hurries to
the safety of a harness just in time. He holds onto the
harness as the Cepheus EXPLODES FORWARD.

As the STAGING occurs, and the INTER-STAGE FAIRING SECTION
and ROCKET ENGINE beneath it can be seen through the window
below Roy, falling away into the void.

NOTE: The physical environment in the ship is now especially
CHAOTIC and MESSY: Wiring, equipment, debris, balls of blood
and sweat... all criss-crossing this way and that in the zero-
g...


INT. THE CEPHEUS - COCKPIT

Roy moves into the cockpit.

He check's Yoshida's pulse. Nothing. Yoshida is now DEAD.
Roy eyes the floating CORPSES of former crewmates Scobee and
Yoshida.


INT. THE CEPHEUS - AIRLOCK

Roy prepares the two bodies with none of the ceremony or
religion that were afforded to Blunt. He leaves them in the
airlock and steps out, back into--


INT. THE CEPHEUS - OUTSIDE AIRLOCK

He presses a button to open the airlock to the void.


EXT. SPACE - THE CEPHEUS
THE SHIP RELEASES THE TWO BODIES as the Cepheus speeds
away...


INT. COCKPIT

Roy grabs a fresh helmet and moves into the cockpit. A man
ALONE. He PAUSES FOR A MOMENT; his HANDS are BLOTCHY and
BLEEDING...

                    ROCKET COMPUTER VOICE
          Significant damage to rocket
          staging capability... Reentry
          protection in section THREE
          DESTROYED...
                                                             90.


EXT. THE CEPHEUS - SPACE

The spaceship is moving at such a terrific velocity that
there's PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT in the surrounding field of
stars: APPROACHING STARS appear blue, RECEDING STARS become
amber. (This is the "red shift" effect.)


INT. COCKPIT

Roy is seated at the fore of the ship. He's still BLEEDING
PROFUSELY. He goes through a MEDICAL KIT, applies GELS to
his wound. He's trying to stem the seeping tide of blood.

He is ghostly and alone in the ship's DARKNESS.      And outside
of the ship's darkness: INFINITE PITCH BLACK.

But... finally... a slight GLOW appears from the COCKPIT
MONITOR...

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             Destination, Neptune Moon Galatea
             coordinates.

                       COMPUTER VOICE
             Length of journey: 19 days, 4
             hours, 8 minutes. Sedation is
             advised.

Roy HOOKS HIMSELF UP to a FEED TUBE, into his arm. He
BUCKLES HIMSELF IN, and straps start sending ELECTRICAL
PULSES to his body, to keep his muscles in some sort of tone.

Roy SETTLES IN, and the ROCKETS ALIGHT...    He is on his
way...
                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE

The craft PASSES an UNMANNED SPACE PROBE...

A distant ASTEROID FIELD...    JUPITER, distant...


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy examines the view outside his window.    He grows AGITATED.

ALL OF A SUDDEN, BLOOD STARTS POURING INTO THE CRAFT, from
EVERY WALL!

It FILLS THE CAPSULE!
                                                              91.


YOSHIDA and SCOBEE are BACK, INSIDE.    They ARE ASSAULTING
ROY!

THE CAPSULE BEGINS SPINNING AGAIN!

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

And then--

THROUGH THE SPINNING--he REACHES over to the console and
injects something into his arm.

Within moments, the craft is no longer spinning.       THE
ASTRONAUTS ARE GONE.

HE WAS HALLUCINATING...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - SATURN - LATER

The giant gas planet SATURN looms magnificently against the
black backdrop. Its RINGS look like thin ribbons encircling
the planet. So perfect is this gas giant, so symmetrical and
flawless in its geometry... it almost looks UNREAL.

We TILT DOWN to SEE the Cepheus PASS US BY.


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy's EYES ARE HALF-MAST. His P.O.V.: A WATERY surface over
his eyes causes a slight oblong, double-vision VIEW of the
CAPSULE CONSOLE.
                       COMPUTER VOICE
             Now passing final unmanned outpost,
             Trojan QF99. Conserve oxygen and
             food supply if possible--

ROY CLOSES HIS EYES.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - URANUS

The planet, in the distance.    Roy's spacecraft passes it...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
                                                           92.


INT. CEPHEUS

SOUNDS. It's a 1930's RADIO SHOW that somehow his craft has
picked up. ROY'S EYES OPEN.

A STRANGE and NATURAL and UNEXPLAINED SPACE PHENOMENON
OCCURS.

What looks like FIREFLIES FLOWS through the CAPSULE. It's
HALLUCINATORY and ROY SEES THEM through SEDATED EYES.

He REACHES UP to TOUCH THEM; the SPARKS SEEM TO FLOAT RIGHT
THROUGH his HANDS. (These unexplained phenomena do exist.)

His BODY BEGINS TO LIFT UP, OUT OF THE SEAT.   He STAYS in
PLACE because of the seatbelts.

His BREATHING BECOMES HEAVIER.    Close to some kind of panic.

Roy starts to HYPERVENTILATE, STRUGGLING.   He INJECTS
something into his arm. As we:

                                                    CUT TO:


EXT. SPACE - NEPTUNE

The BLUE PLANET.   STILL.   EERIE.


INT. CEPHEUS

A CHIME:

                      COMPUTER VOICE
            Task Load Index completed.
ROY UNBUCKLES HIMSELF.

MOVES back to the PILOT'S SEAT.


EXT. SPACE - NEAR NEPTUNE

Now: Roy's spaceship, the Cepheus, comes into view, its RETRO-
THRUSTERS firing on full blast (in utter silence) to slow its
velocity.

NEW ANGLE

More prominently now, THE RINGS OF NEPTUNE.

CLOSER ANGLE
                                                          93.

On one of the OUTER RINGS.   The Cepheus is tiny against the
magnificent vista.


INT. CEPHEUS

Roy PILOTS the CRAFT as it nears the EDGE of the rings, and
keeps pace with the speed of the rings' orbit.

Roy LOOKS DOWN at the CONSOLE.     BLINKING:

"CRAFT OXYGEN LEVEL: 12 PERCENT"

He LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW and is momentarily energized by
Neptune's BLUE GLOW. The rings are more visible now. They
are magnificent, comprised of various-sized ROCKS of dirt and
ice that circle around us, almost like cars on a racetrack.

Roy looks at the control panels, the monitors.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Locate signal source.

                    COMPUTER VOICE
          The source is [scientifically
          correct location, tbd].

He PULLS a LARGE SWITCH.

The cockpit board flashes: "AUTOPILOT ENGAGED".

ROY PUNCHES THE GALATEA COORDINATES into his SPACESUIT
SLEEVE.

A BLINKING RED LIGHT on the CONSOLE.
He REACHES OVER, TOGGLES THE SWITCH:


EXT. THE CEPHEUS - CONTINUOUS

Roy EMERGES from the craft, in his suit. He REMAINS TETHERED
TO THE CRAFT. The CRAFT, moving along with the orbiting
rings of detritus, begins to move closer to the rings...

CLOSER TO THE RINGS

He maneuvers his way BEHIND THE COCKPIT SECTION of the craft,
so he is protected FROM the DETRITUS of NEPTUNE'S RINGS by
the CRAFT'S BODY ITSELF.

He REMOVES a SMALL SOLAR PANEL--ABOUT FIVE FEET IN LENGTH,
and about THREE FEET IN WIDTH--from the SIDE OF THE CEPHEUS.
                                                           94.

He CLIMBS to the ROTATING ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY WHEEL.

He GRABS ONTO ONE OF THE SPINNING WINDMILL-LIKE BLADES.

HE UNHOOKS HIS TETHER.

HE HOLDS ON.

SPINNING AND SPINNING. DIZZYING.

HE LOOKS AT HIS SLEEVE. A COMPASS NUMBER KEEPS SCANNING
different DIRECTIONAL COORDINATES.

AND THEN--at JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT--

HE LETS GO.

HE IS PROPELLED THROUGH SPACE, without his TETHER.


EXT. THROUGH THE RINGS

He enters the rings. Miniscule particles begin to hit the
SOLAR PANEL that ROY USES AS HIS SHIELD.

Some come insanely close to ROY, to his HEAD, to puncturing
his SUIT.

The SOLAR PANEL is GETTING NICKED and DAMAGED by the
PARTICULATE, but it protects Roy.


EXT. CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE

He TUMBLES FURTHER, now ENTERING THE CLOUDS OF NEPTUNE.

The CLOUDS are DENSE, like bad CLOUD COVER during an airplane
flight. EXCEPT--THEY ARE A RICH, INTENSE BLUE.

As Roy TUMBLES, the SHADE OF THE CLOUDS goes from that BLUE
to a BEAUTIFUL and BEYOND-THIS-EARTH PINK, then to a DEEP
MAGENTA.

AND THEN IT BEGINS TO APPEAR, EVER SO FAINTLY.

A SPACECRAFT.

It is TETHERED to the slowly ROTATING MOON CALLED GALATEA
which orbits NEPTUNE inside Neptune's atmosphere.

It is THE LIMA PROJECT.

CLOSER AND CLOSER it comes to us.   ROY SEEMS SPINNING TOWARD
IT, OUT OF CONTROL.
                                                            95.

And then he THROWS the THRUSTER in his PACK.     His tumbling
GRADUALLY GETS UNDER CONTROL.

He STOPS. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION. IN the
DISTANCE: a SYMMETRICAL SERIES of SCANNING MIRROR TELESCOPES.
In a LATTICE.

NEW ANGLE OF ROY - behind him, in the deep distance, is
Earth, a tiny pinprick of light 900 million miles away.    (See
recent Cassini photograph.) Then, CUT TO WHAT HE SEES:

Hovering over the station, still far away from Roy, are:

ASTRONAUTS. Appearing as figures on the dark blue horizon,
levitating over NEPTUNE.

THE LINE OF ASTRONAUTS FLOATS, STILL.

ROY PUSHES a BUTTON on his WRIST.   We HEAR STATIC.

                     ROY MCBRIDE
           LIMA PROJECT. This is Major Roy
           McBride. I have taken control of
           the Cepheus, United States Armed
           Forces Space Division. I am
           attempting to reach Dr. Clifford
           McBride. Over.

Static.   No movement.

                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
           Repeat: Lima Project, this is the
           Cepheus, of the United States Armed
           Forces Space Division. I am
           attempting to reach Dr. McBride.
           Do you read.

NO RESPONSE.

ROY TURNS his RIGHT WRIST OVER.

"MMU OXYGEN LEVEL: 21 PERCENT"

"THRUST LEVEL: 39 PERCENT"

HE MOVES toward the SURFACE of the LIMA PROJECT STATION. As
HE DOES, he LOOKS to his RIGHT to SEE, maybe a mile away
(hard to tell relative direction here), the very BEGINNINGS
of a graphene arc.
                                                           96.

EXT./INT. LIMA PROJECT STATION

Roy "floats" inside.    The Craft/Station has a kind of LARGE A-
FRAME.

Roy VENTURES through the CENTER of the STATION.

HUGE SPACES filled with SELF-REPLICATORS that do not resemble
anything anthropormorphic, but rather look like the kind of
machines which make AUTOMOBILES. WE HEAR Roy's BREATHING.

ROY'S P.O.V. - The robots are in repose, ready to be
awakened. WE CONTINUE TO HEAR Roy's BREATHING...

He passes the anthropoid robots, and enters another, even
larger, area.

ROY'S P.O.V. - A flurry of automated activity, as we pass
EVERY SPECIES OF ROBOT, from giant vehicles to small, squat
machines, gliding to and fro. Some are fitted with grabs and
manipulators and cutting/welding equipment.

Again, no sign of humans. The robots move slowly, with
secret purpose, WARNING LIGHTS whirling for the benefit of
the unseen humans.


INT. INNER SANCTUM

ROY now ventures to SEE, on both sides:

WINDOWS, through which we can spot the INTERIOR of the LIMA
PROJECT.

As Roy makes some final adjustments to his equipment, we
notice one of the very small robots on the side of the A-
Frame. A CAMERA mounted on it silently ROTATES towards Roy,
and a RED LIGHT blinks on next to the camera. It knows Roy
is here. Roy LOOKS RIGHT INTO IT:

                       ROY MCBRIDE
             I am Major Roy McBride. Do you
             read. I am attempting to reach Dr.
             McBride.

AGAIN, no ANSWER. ROY PLACES EXPLOSIVE CHARGES on the
DOORFRAME of the LIMA STATION.

They BLOW.

Just then, an APERTURE on the station opens up.   ROY VENTURES
INSIDE. LIKE HE IS ENTERING A DREAM.
                                                           97.

INT. LIMA PROJECT - DORMITORIES

HUMAN BODIES are FLOATING, gravity-free.   The FLUORESCENT
LIGHTS FLICKER.

We STILL HEAR ONLY ROY'S BREATHING.   LOUD, PRESENT.   We ARE
COMPLETELY INSIDE HIS HEAD.

Roy finds himself inside a KITCHEN-TYPE area, which is housed
somewhere within a laboratory. There are machines and
equipment and tables and sinks, but no people besides Roy.

There's ZERO GRAVITY here.

ROY'S POINT-OF-VIEW:

A DOOR IS OPEN, revealing a dark PASSAGEWAY lit only by BLUE
LIGHT.


INT. PASSAGEWAY

Roy enters/floats into it. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALL THE MONITORS
on each side--and there are several--switch on. THE LIGHTS
BRIGHTEN. ON THE SCREENS: ROY'S FATHER! DR. H. CLIFFORD
MCBRIDE. Roy HALTS:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
          This will be the final message
          recorded by the Lima Project. Our
          efforts have come to an end, and
          its entire story must be told in
          the hopes that someday it will be
          known.

ROY MOVES CLOSER TO THE SCREEN.   It is his FATHER, virtually
seeming to speak from the dead:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          We came here to pursue mankind's
          most noble goal: the search for
          intelligent life beyond the Earth.
          But our telescope has repeatedly
          confirmed only the singular
          importance--and ephemerality--of
          our moon, oceans, and magnetic
          field. After extensive analysis,
          we now confirm that we are entirely
          alone in the reachable universe.
          We shall no longer honor false
          gods; there is no intelligent life
          elsewhere, and the rage of the
          cosmos will destroy us in time.
                    (MORE)
                                                           98.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          For this reason, we on the Lima
          Project had begun to devise a plan
          for a new system--with galaxies,
          stars, and planets. We dreamed to
          be the first lifeform to make the
          universe anew.

CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY MCBRIDE.

                                                     CUT TO:


INT. NARROW STAIRWELL

Roy CLIMBS the STEPS.   We STILL HEAR, CONTINUING:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O)
          With the vast stores of antimatter
          we have discovered here, our
          research focused on the creation of
          a new big bang. Such a project
          would take perhaps several thousand
          years to develop. But only such a
          bold, long-term endeavor would
          untether us from the earth and
          ensure the permanent survival of
          our species.


INT. CONTROL CENTER - STATION

Roy FLOATS TOWARD the Control Center. Like the Control Tower
of a large airport, it's somewhat dark--but everything is ON.
Multiple MONITORS, SCREENS, GAUGES, etc., all like a symphony
of blinking, fluttering color and light.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O)
          Our research is contained on the
          onboard VD recorder. It is the
          most extensive set of data ever
          assembled about the visible
          universe. This must be brought
          back to Earth so that our
          scientists can be convinced to act.
          However, our computer system is
          currently preventing all outside
          communication. As it is charged
          only with the continued pursuit of
          intelligent life, it has been
          unable to adapt to our changed
          prerogatives. All attempts to
          reprogram it have failed. With no
          alternatives, we sought to return
          to the Earth.
                                                          99.

Roy looks around at the many screens in front of him; they
are like SECURITY CAMERAS, constantly cutting from one angle
to another. ONE ANGLE REVEALS:

A SPACECRAFT, with a GANTRY. MODEST SIZE. CLOSE SHOT ON
ROY. THEN CLOSE SHOT ON IMAGE OF SPACECRAFT. THEN:

ROY SCANS THROUGH BASIC BLUEPRINT PLANS of the LIMA PROJECT's
CRAFT.


INT. DATABANKS - LIMA PROJECT

It is ROWS of DATA, stored.   A CLOUD for all the information
collected by the Project.

Roy FLOATS THROUGH IT, approaching TWO LARGE ORANGE STEEL
CANNISTERS: "VOYAGE DATA RECORDER" He PULLS THEM OUT FROM
THE FRAME. Over this, we STILL HEAR:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          A craft was assembled from 3-D-
          printed parts, piece by piece, out
          of view of the onboard system. But
          it was recognized upon completion,
          and our nuclear fuel has been
          intentionally destroyed by the
          system. This resulted in the
          catastrophic destruction of moon
          Larissa. All of us have suffered
          severe radiation poisoning. Brain
          death is imminent. The onboard
          system will likely maintain only
          our organ function in order for it
          to remain operational.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS

CLOSE SHOT: "DR. CLIFF MCBRIDE". A PAPER TAB, HANDWRITTEN.
On the DOOR of his LIVING QUARTERS.

Roy FLOATS INTO/ENTERS the LIVING QUARTERS.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.)
          We hope we will be mourned by a
          Mother Earth that dared send so
          many of her sons and daughters into
          the unknown. In ancient days,
          human beings looked at stars and
          saw their heroes in the
          constellations. In modern times,
          our heroes have become creatures of
          flesh and blood.
                    (MORE)
                                                          100.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Others will follow us, and surely
          find their way home. Our mission
          must not be denied.

HE LOOKS AROUND. He SEES the SPACE. It is MODEST, with
SCIENCE BOOKS, and DIARIES, and FAMILY PHOTOS everywhere,
pinned on the WALLS. Then we HEAR Francesca's VOICE, more
PRESENT than CLIFFORD McBRIDE'S had been:

                     FRANCESCA'S VOICE
          "The brain is wider than the sky,
          for, put them side by side, the
          other will include, with ease, and
          you beside..."
              (beat)
          It's so beautiful... Do you want
          to hear another one...?

Then, APPEARING: FRANCESCA! SEATED, SOMEHOW STILL OBEYING
GRAVITY as ROY FLOATS! She STARES, saying nothing.

Roy doesn't know what to do, or say.   He STOPS HIS MOVEMENT.
He lifts his ARM toward her...

She GETS UP, begins to WALK TOWARD ROY!!

NEAR HIM NOW, HE REACHES OUT, and...

HIS HAND AND ARM GO RIGHT THROUGH HER!!!!    SHE WALKS RIGHT
THROUGH HIM, sits down at the other end.

Roy LOOKS AROUND THE SPACE and SEES NOW that it's like his
home where he grew up, his home from pictures.   PROJECTED.

IT'S ALL HOLOGRAMS.

He SEES: HIMSELF, as a CHILD, on the FLOOR, PLAYING WITH
TRUCKS. And his MOTHER, LEANNE, YOUNGER. His HAND can go
right through them, too.

(As ROY FLOATS, these HOLOGRAMS remain "earthbound"; that is,
they seem to have "gravity".)

Roy TURNS BACK to LOOK AT FRANCESCA. She is in conversation
with someone "offscreen," smiling, looking lovely and warm
and everything an idealized version of her would be.


CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY.

We HEAR the PITTER-PATTER of RAIN.   RAIN?   ALL OTHER SOUND
DROPS OUT. And we:

                                                    CUT TO:
                                                        101.


EXT. NEW YORK - THE CLOISTERS - RAINY DAY

A lowered gray sky. Deserted. A monastery on the UPPER WEST
SIDE of NEW YORK'S MANHATTAN ISLAND. A PORTCULLIS.
COBBLESTONES. The VIDEO we saw, yes, but now we are "here,"
in the space.

A GROUP of children PLAY. ADULTS speak to each other,
standing behind the children, watching them play, making
small talk. The scene has a strange, dare we say, unearthly
quality to it. There is a distance to it; not an emotional
distance, but a visual distance. A haze, almost. A
dreamlike quality.

A SMALLER GROUP of adults, and two children, are here, too.
They are nearby and yet somehow apart.

We SEE: ROY'S MOTHER, LEANNE. Much YOUNGER. She seems
PREOCCUPIED, though she smiles a lot as she attends to the
children. Also here is some other woman we don't know, about
Leanne's age. She is completely quiet, almost nervous, as
she watches the children play.

Then there is H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, who is involved with the
children, making hats for them, drawing for them, joking with
them.

AMONG THE CHILDREN: the young ROY. And the young FRANCESCA
(though she is older than Roy--she seems around 16 or 17, he
around 8). She has a grin from ear to ear; Roy does not,
instead dedicated to whatever he seems to be DRAWING.

H. Clifford McBride stops clowning with another child and
moves to Roy's side. Warmly:

                          H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
          Roy?
                 (beat)
          Roy?
              (to Young Francesca)
          He gets very involved in what he's
          doing.

                     YOUNG FRANCESCA
              (a laugh; a smile)
          It's okay.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
          Sweetheart, I need you to listen to
          me for just a moment--you can go
          back to your drawing very soon.

Roy finally looks up--for just a brief beat.
                                                           102.


                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          This is Francesca.

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA
              (ebullient)
          Hello!

                      ROY MCBRIDE
                (back to his drawing)
          Hi.

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE
          She's someone...very close to me,
          someone I really care for. I want
          you to meet her--I think you'll
          really like her.

Roy keeps drawing--AND THEN TURNS HIS BACK TO HER A BIT.

                     H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          It's not so easy for Roy to meet
          new people. It's something we're
          trying to work on with him.
              (quieter)
          We're hoping he'll break through it
          someday...

Clifford approaches Roy. Not unsympathetically, he touches
his son and attempts to communicate an important lesson about
human interaction:

                    H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
              (to Roy)
          When someone talks to you, you say
          hello, you look them in the eye.
          You listen, and you ask how they
          are--you don't want them to think
          you don't care about them.

Roy REACTS IMMEDIATELY. He starts to get teary out of
embarrassment and awkwardness. Sensing this, she moves to
comfort him:

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA
          It's okay, you can go back to your
          drawing. He just wanted us to
          meet.

Roy then eyes her directly, and without a word.     She looks at
his drawing. Warmly:

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT'D)
          That's a wonderful picture. Is
          that a rocket?
                                                         103.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (nods; then)
          My father goes into space.

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA
          That's where I'm from.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
              (looks up, interested now)
          Where?

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA
          I'm from Mars. Which is really,
          really far.

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Yeah. Sometimes it's more than 140
          million miles away. But right now
          it's only 80 million miles.

                    YOUNG FRANCESCA
              (again with a laugh)
          I didn't know that!

                    ROY MCBRIDE
          Are you by yourself there?

                     YOUNG FRANCESCA
          No, but it feels like that
          sometimes. That's why I'm so glad
          I met you.

UNEXPECTEDLY, responding to her kindness to such a degree he
can overcome his shyness, he hands his drawing to her.
Francesca looks at the drawing and she is very moved. TEARS
OF HAPPINESS come to her eyes. Roy STARES at the tears as
though they are foreign objects. The SWELL OF EMOTION from
her is as strange as anything he has seen.
                    YOUNG FRANCESCA (CONT'D)
          Oh--thank you so much! That's so
          sweet of you! It's beautiful!

She gives him a BIG, TENDER HUG.   Roy ALLOWS HIMSELF to be
"crushed" by the hug.

Roy's FATHER BEAMS...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:
                                                           104.

INT. HULL OF CRAFT - CORNER OF MCBRIDE RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS

A chamber that appears almost like an old "Iron Lung"
machine. Roy APPROACHES IT.

CLOSE SHOT: "MCBRIDE, CLIFFORD, 788919-0323"

It's a small, illuminated medical identification card.    WIDEN
TO REVEAL:

ROY, COMING UPON his FATHER'S BODY, inside what looks like a
kind of ELECTRONIC SARCOPHAGUS.

Dr. H. Clifford McBride exists in a vegetative state, resting
in a large silver CASE. Through glass, we can SEE that his
EYES ARE slightly OPEN, his BODY HOOKED UP to LIFE SUPPORT
SYSTEMS.

MONITORS around the case MEASURE his PULSE and other VITAL
SIGNS. He is KEPT COLD.

ROY moves to it, OPENS THE SARCOPHAGUS.   STARES AT HIS
FATHER'S LOBOTOMIZED FACE.

He LIFTS his FATHER'S STIFF, LIFELESS BODY out of its
electronic SARCOPHAGUS, pulling off the DIODES and IVs which
keep him "alive".

When the body EMERGES from the SARCOPHAGUS, it seems almost
to FLOAT STANDING STIFFLY UPRIGHT. It starts SPINNING IN THE
WEIGHTLESSNESS.

ROY GRABS the SPINNING BODY, in a way that becomes an
EMBRACE. PULLING THE BODY WITH HIM, he FLOATS BACK OUT...

                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE LIMA PROJECT STATION - IN SPACE

ROY releases his FATHER'S BODY INTO SPACE, PUSHING IT TOWARD
the SURFACE of NEPTUNE.

IN the DISTANCE, WE SEE H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE'S BODY drift
TOWARD a RING AROUND NEPTUNE.

The BODY comes in contact with a SMALL ICE ROCK. It SHATTERS
INTO A MILLION PIECES. LIKE BROKEN WINDSHIELD GLASS.

Almost at the VERY INSTANT that H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE's BODY is
destroyed, LIGHTS COME ON in a formerly DARKENED SECTION of
the LIMA CRAFT.
                                                         105.


EXT. SPACE - NEAR THE LIMA CRAFT - OUTSIDE 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

A spacecraft which remains DOCKED. It has been constructed
for Dr. Clifford McBride's return, presumably. It NOW HUMS
WITH LIFE.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy enters the cockpit, HOLDING the ORANGE VDR ("VOYAGE DATA
RECORDER") CANNISTERS.

Examining the craft's SYSTEMS, he and we recognize that it is
astonishingly similar to the Cepheus. (The spacecraft are
all constructed by 3-D PRINTER, and there is a uniformity to
their design and construction.)

The entire SYSTEM of the CRAFT COMES TO LIFE, ONLINE.

AS DOES: RADIO STATIC FROM THE EARTH!   Communication has been
restored:

ROY PRESSES THE RADIO BUTTON, TURNS DIALS FOR A CERTAIN CODE:

                     ROY MCBRIDE
          SpaceCom. This is Major Roy
          McBride. I have taken it upon
          myself and have reached the Lima
          Project; all crew are deceased. I
          have recovered significant material
          for analysis, which I am now in the
          process of forwarding to you. The
          self-replicators here malfunctioned
          and must be destroyed to prevent
          any unforseen further catastrophe.
          Therefore, I'm inputting target
          coordinates 34.34 North, 81.92 West
          from Earth standard vector 100.
              (beat)
          I'm going to attempt a return to
          the earth now. The onboard system
          indicates I'll be arriving in
          approximately 41 days and 9 hours.
          My journey will have kept me in an
          isolated state for a considerable
          period by that time. I...I am very
          much looking forward to the day
          that solitude ends. Over.

He FLIPS OFF THE RADIO.

He PULLS DOWN on a LARGE LEVER which looks almost like the
kind of control switch for a 747 airplane.
                                                        106.


He moves around the CAPSULE, OBSERVING a PRINTED CHECKLIST.
Adjusts SEVERAL SWITCHES.

MOMENTS LATER

Roy is SETTLING IN to his COCKPIT SEAT. He is about to PUT
an OXYGEN MASK ON. He activates the CRAFT's GYROSCOPES and
CONTROL STICK.

Then:

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Outgoing mail. McBride, Roy M.
          Send to Leanne McBride.

He SEES an IMAGE of HIS MOTHER. It's a photo of her, with
him as a little boy. A little ANIMATED BEE flies around the
picture, making a PUTT-PUTT SOUND.

                    ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Record voice message.

After a BEEP--Roy begins to record his message. As we know,
he's not much one for communicating--especially when emotions
are concerned. But here...

                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
          Mother, I'm on a classified mission
          right now.
              (beat)
          I am by myself.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY--almost imperceptively so--PUSHES INTO HIM:

                     ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
              (equivocating; then he
               steels himself)
          I am attempting now to return to
          the earth. In the event I cannot,
          I don't want you to wonder about
          me.
              (beat)
          I'd like to express to you that I
          realize that you gave me an
          excellent childhood. I am grateful
          to you now for attempting to
          nurture friendships and other
          relationships. Perhaps you don't
          think I remember much, but I do.
          Sometimes the smell of certain
          foods will bring back exceedingly
          pleasant memories... On this
          mission I've encountered people who
          knew father.
                     (MORE)
                                                         107.

                      ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
            I don't know how much you know
            about this, but it appears he had
            another child, a daughter named
            Francesca. We both met her once.
            She and I talked. She informed me
            that father acted out of the
            noblest principles. And that he
            sacrificed himself in the name of
            science.

He stops.   TEARS WELL UP AGAIN. He CLOSES HIS EYES and BOWS
HIS HEAD.   Then begins to speak again:

                      ROY MCBRIDE (CONT'D)
            Mother, I, I was unable to protect
            her. I regret this--terribly.
            Even worse than I regret any
            negative feelings toward father.
            It's led me to commit acts that you
            would condemn--but were required by
            circumstance. It has forced me to
            be alone, a situation I now find
            unacceptable.
                (exhales; regroups)
            But I have succeeded in my mission.
            I want to say goodbye now, and
            whatever occurs on my return, I am
            forever your loving son.

He SHUTS OFF the RECORDER.   ANGLE ON THE FROZEN IMAGE of
ROY'S MOTHER.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

The Craft's GANTRY RELEASES the ship.   Slowly.
The CRAFT begins to move, its ROCKETS FIRING.

Almost at the same time: A BEAM, HIGH-INTENSITY, HITS A PART
OF THE STATION.

It EXPLODES! In SILENCE. The colors of the explosion, set
against the DEEP BLACKNESS of SPACE.

Then another SILENT and COLORFUL EXPLOSION.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy looks through his windows to SEE:

A SERIES OF LASERS HITTING VARIOUS PARTS of the STATION and
TELESCOPE.
                                                        108.

In SILENCE, the EXPLOSIONS ARE VAST, FEROCIOUS, and somehow
oddly BEAUTIFUL.

They ILLUMINATE the dead BLACKNESS of SPACE even as they are
utterly destructive, devastatingly so.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy's ROCKET starts to STAGE, AFTER its initial BURST. It
leaves the CONTINUED DEVASTATION of the LIMA PROJECT in its
wake as it PROPELS FORWARD.


INT. 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

Roy's HEAD SHAKES TO AND FRO; the ROCKET'S FORCE is
ASTONISHING.


EXT. SPACE - 3-D PRINTED CRAFT

The CRAFT FIRES a NEW SET OF ROCKETS. It moves on, deeper
and deeper and deeper toward the earth. The RADIO PIPES UP,
and it's in the most straightforward, almost banal, tone
imaginable:

                     SPACECOM VOICE
          Major McBride, this is SpaceCom.
          We have verified the authenticity
          of your coordinates and have begun
          to target sites accordingly. Upon
          reentry to earth's orbit, we will
          intercept your craft and you will
          be debriefed. However, we do
          acknowledge the potential of your
          data files to transform rather
          radically our view of what the
          universe may hold.
              (beat)
          We wish you godspeed on your
          journey homeward. US SPACECOM out.

Finally, Roy's ROCKET disappears from our view, hurtling back
toward the EARTH.


                        THE END
