                             a screenplay by

                    Patrick Melton & Marcus Dunstan



                                                             11-20-06

                         OVER DARKNESS :
          Nothing. A void of darkness and silence. And then--
          INSERT TITLE : "He who has a why to live can bear with almost
          any how." --Friedrich Nietzsche
          The TITLE begins to fade out as--

                         OVER DARKNESS :
          TAPE HISS... then a familiar VOICE.
          JIGSAW (V.O.)
          I'm the only person who knows where
          your daughter is.

                         (BEAT)
          She only has a limited supply of
          air... and if you want her back...
          you'll have to play a game.
          The tape hissing continues.
          Then, a low murmur. It's a man sobbing. His sobbing grows
          into a POWERFUL SCREAM from the bottom of his soul...

                         FADE INTO:
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE SICK ROOM -- NIGHT
          Back with JEFF. He's splayed out on the floor. His body
          twisted. His eyes covered with ash.
          His headless wife, LYNN, slumps against a wall. He's stares.
          AMANDA lies nearby. Blood still pulsating from her neck.
          And on the table. There he is. Blood oozing from his cut
          neck. It's JIGSAW. Dead. His eyes still open, though.
          Staring right at Jeff.
          Jeff mumbles, reaching a hand out to his wife, but he
          retracts. He can't do it.
          Grief flows through his body. Rising, he moves to one of
          the doors leading out. He yanks on the door.
          Nothing doing. He begins ramming it, screaming.

                         JEFF
          Come on! Come on, goddamn it!
          Jeff looks for any type of crack in the locked door. Nothing.
          2.
          Then, his eyes shift to the table filled with SURGICAL
          EQUIPMENT and MEDICATION. He spots something.
          CLOSE ON : A CROWBAR. Definitely out of place.
          Jeff moves to grab it. But it's CONNECTED TO A METAL WIRE.
          And the second he pulls the crowbar...
          THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM GO OUT.
          Pitch dark. All that's heard is Jeff's FRANTIC BREATHING.
          Then, it's seen. On the far wall.
          A GLOWING X on the tile wall.
          Jeff moves to it. He pushes at it. Nothing doing.
          He uses the crowbar. Smashing the wall. Over and over.
          It eventually crumbles. There's a small CRAWL SPACE.
          It's the only way out. Jeff drops the crowbar, gets on his
          knees, and enters the crawl space...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- CRAWL SPACE -- MOMENTS LATER
          A dark, small, cob-web infested space. Jeff moves blindly.
          CLOSE ON : A row of RUSTED NAILS stick up from the floor.
          Jeff unknowingly crawls right on to the nails, his HAND
          sinking right down into one...

                         JEFF
          Jesus!!!
          Jeff retracts, gasping in the pain. Blood oozing.
          He's able to crawl around them, avoiding any more by looking
          much closer at where he crawls.
          Jeff comes to a CROSSROADS. He can either go RIGHT or LEFT.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Corbett!
          He's screaming for his daughter.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Corbett!!!
          Jeff's head sways. He's losing it. Blood streaking his
          face. He's about to collapse when...
          3.

                         CORBETT

                         (VERY FAINT)
          Daddy?
          Jeff's head whips up. That was his daughter. And it was
          coming down the right crawl space duct.

                         JEFF
          Corbett! It's okay! Daddy's coming!
          Daddy's coming! You stay right there!
          CLOSE ON : RUSTY NAILS stick out from the side and top of the
          crawl space now.
          But it doesn't matter to Jeff. He's moving with vigor.
          He's going to save his daughter.
          Jeff rounds a corner and...

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Corbett?! Say something, baby. Say
          something! Daddy needs to hear you.
          FROM JOHN'S P.O.V. : There's a LIGHT. Just ahead. It's very
          bright. Making him unable to see past it.
          Jeff keeps moving towards the light. He begins to squint.
          The light becoming brighter.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Corbett!

                         CORBETT
          Daddy! Daddy! Help me!
          His daughter's getting louder. He's getting closer.
          CLOSE ON : Jeff's knee plunges right on to a nail.

                         JEFF
          Ahh...It's gonna be okay...Daddy's
          almost there!
          He fights through it, leaving a blood trail.
          Closer... closer...closer...

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Corbett! I'm here! I'm right here...
          Then, getting past a mounted FLOODLIGHT, Jeff sees it.
          CLOSE ON : It's a SPEAKER. And a MICROPHONE.
          4.

                         CORBETT

                         (THROUGH SPEAKER)
          Daddy! Where are you? Where are
          you, Daddy?

                         JEFF
          You motherfu -
          CRASH! A trap door in the floor gives way. Jeff DROPS...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- DUEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          WHAM! Jeff lands face-first in a large, bell-shaped glass
          container. It's raised off the ground.
          The container narrows at the base where a clear, plastic
          plate supports Jeff.
          Underneath the plate are TWO ROTATING BLADES.
          The entire device looks like a GIANT BLENDER.
          If the blades spin and the plate parts, Jeff will be pureed
          within seconds.

                         JEFF
          Oh god...
          Jeff claws at the sides of the container, but they've been
          GREASED. If he tries to crawl up, he'll slide back down.
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          You son of a bitch!
          Jeff's eyes turn.
          A MAN is strapped to a metal throne. His wrists and ankles
          held down.
          Before the man, there is a bank of MONITORS.
          CLOSE ON : The monitors show the series of rooms that Jeff
          went through in Saw 3. The final one is of the SICK ROOM.
          And it currently shows LYNN. Headless. Dead.
          MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
          You killed her... you stupid
          asshole... you killed her...
          Jeff gawks. He might not recognize him, but we do...
          INT. CONDOMINIUM -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          CHRIS lies in the bed staring up at his lover, Lynn.
          5.

                         LYNN
          What is it that you want from me,
          Chris?
          Chris, almost ashamed - the words near impossible to say.

                         CHRIS
          A divorce.
          His words hit Lynn like a punch to the gut and...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- DUEL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Yes. It's CHRIS in the chair. Lynn's SECRET LOVER.

                         JEFF
          Who are you...
          ZZCCCCCHHH !!!
          A square of STATIC explodes to life on a TV in the corner.
          It cuts to an image. A face.
          The bone white, wooden face of a HARLEQUIN PUPPET. It's
          slotted jaw moves, omitting a heavily distorted VOICE.

                         DOLL

                         (FROM SCREEN)
          Hello Chris... I want to play a game.
          This game involves the simple decision
          to either allow the man before you
          to live... or die.

                         (BEAT)
          Forgiveness is all that separated
          Jeff from his family. He chose
          vengeance. It cost him the wife he
          ignored... the woman you loved.
          Jeff heard that. His chest heaves.

                         DOLL (CONT'D)
          Now, you both grieve with this loss,
          but Chris, will you be able to do
          what Jeff was unable to? Will you
          be able to forgive?

                         (BEAT)
          There are two keys in this room.
          They both lead to your freedom, but
          each will lead you on a very different
          path.

                         (BEAT)
          The first key unlocks the device
          that holds Jeff. It represents his
          life, and your forgiveness.

                         (MORE)
          6.

                         DOLL (CONT'D)
          The other unlocks the door out of
          here. It represents his death, and
          your loss.

                         (BEAT)
          Have you learned the lesson that
          Jeff couldn't, Chris? Or will you
          continue the cycle of vengeance?
          You have thirty seconds to decide.

                         (BEAT)
          Live or die, Chris... make your
          choice.
          The screen cuts to static.
          Behind Chris, a DIGITAL CLOCK counts down from THIRTY.
          The metal restraints on Chris's hands and ankles spring open.
          He is free to stand.
          The blades underneath Jeff's feet start to ROTATE.

                         JEFF
          Hey! Hey!
          Jeff frantically looks around.
          There's a METAL TUBE below the blender device. It leads to
          a KEY. But to get to it, Chris will have to stick his entire
          arm through the tube filled with METAL SHARDS, RUSTED NAILS,
          and BARB WIRE.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Here! Over here!
          Chris's eye are on the door out of the room. There's another
          METAL TUBE with a KEY at the end. This metal tube, however,
          is attached to a CHAIN that vanishes into the darkness above.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Here! Right here!
          Chris turns to Jeff. Jeff frantically points to the metal
          tube.
          Twenty-five seconds... twenty-four... twenty-three...
          Chris looks between the door key and Jeff's key.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          For christ's sake, think of my
          daughter! She doesn't have to lose
          both her parents!
          Chris locks eyes with Jeff.
          7.
          He nods, moves to the metal tube and freezes a second.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Help me! Do it! Help me!
          Chris just gazes at Jeff.
          He looks back to the metal tube. There's a thin piece of
          GLASS he has to punch through to get his hand into the metal
          tube.
          There's a PHOTO of him and Lynn. Taken recently. Of Chris
          sneaking a kiss from Lynn in public.
          Eighteen... seventeen... sixteen...

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          My daughter! Help me save my
          daughter!
          Chris PUNCHES through the piece of glass, sticking his hand
          through the metal tube.
          He cringes, his arm being ripped apart by the sharp elements
          within.
          Chris pulls out the key, his arm now CUT TO SHIT and covered
          in BLOOD.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          It's right here! The lock's right
          here! Quickly! Come on!
          Jeff points to a square pane on the side of the glass
          container. There's a PADLOCK. Open it, and Jeff slides out
          to freedom.
          Fourteen... thirteen... twelve...
          CLOSE ON : The key is thrust into the padlock.
          But Chris freezes. The image of the HEADLESS LYNN strobes
          in Chris's mind.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Goddamn it, come on! Come on! Come
          on!
          Chris is face to face with Jeff.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Open the fucking lock!!!
          Any sympathy within Chris slowly turns to rage. Chris burns.
          8.
          Ten... nine... eight...
          Jeff SLAMS on the glass, right in Chris's face.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Goddamn it, you fuck!!! Open the
          fucking lock!!!
          Chris pulls the key out of the lock.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          He's got my daughter!!! Think of my
          daughter!!!
          Jeff furiously hits the glass.

                         CHRIS
          I'm doing her a favor.
          Chris tosses the key over the lip of the blender device. It
          comes down, hitting the plate at Jeff's feet.

                         JEFF
          You fuck!!! You're killing me you
          fuck!!! Fuck you!!! Fuck you!!!
          Five... four... three...

                         CHRIS
          You killed them all... and you killed
          her. You deserve this.
          Two... one... ZERO--
          EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS IS SHOWN IN HYPER CUTS.
          The plate slides apart underneath Jeff. His legs are eaten
          up to the knee in an instant. He's spun. Jeff howls.
          Chris shuts his eyes, moving towards the door.
          Jeff's entire body is MULCH from the blender device.
          The only sound is the spinning of the blades.
          Chris comes to the metal tube by the door, sticking in his
          arm in to grab the key.
          The second he yanks off the key--
          The metal tube CONSTRICTS. The rusted nails SINK into his
          arm. The barb wire TIGHTENS.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
          No! No! No!
          9.
          The chain attached to the metal tube TIGHTENS. And Chris is
          YANKED UP TO THE CEILING AND BACK ACROSS THE ROOM--
          FROM CHRIS'S P.O.V. : He sails through the air, being pulled
          up and then back down into the BLENDER DEVICE--
          Chris screams as he falls face-first into the blender device
          and is ground up into a BLOODY MULCH within seconds.
          The blender grinds Jeff and Chris into a PUREE.
          Then, at the bottom of the device, the result is seen.
          A clear PLASTIC TUBE. The RED LIQUID fills it. Dropping
          down the tube. The tube leading down into the floor...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- HOLDING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          The tube flows down from the ceiling. Along the wall. And
          into a GLASS JAR.
          The rest of the room is seen. It's a small room with two
          doors. One leads out of the building, and other leads to
          the holding room with CORBETT in it.
          The jar fills with blood to the top, and a lever with BALLOON
          on the end rises, flipping a SWITCH.
          The holding room door SPRINGS OPEN, as does the door leading
          out of the building.
          BRIGHT SUNLIGHT crushes in from the outside.
          Corbett emerges from the holding room. She tip-toes out.
          The light embraces her.

                         CORBETT
          Daddy?
          Corbett exits the building in the blaze of dawn's first rays.
          CUT TO BLACK:
          INSERT TITLE : SAW 4
          EXT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- DAY
          An abandoned WAREHOUSE. Police cars and ambulances are parked
          outside. It's a crime scene.
          HOFFMAN removes a filthy pair of LATEX GLOVES. He wipes
          some sweat off his brow and tosses the latex gloves into a
          pile of other soiled gloves.
          10.
          The officers have been here a while. A mixture of stress
          and anxiety crosses all their faces.
          Corbett, still trembling underneath a blanket, sits at the
          back of a parked ambulance.
          Hoffman looks at the little girl, but Corbett is in shock.
          She sees nothing.
          A burly SWAT commander, RIGG, steps forward.

                         RIGG
          Does he know yet?

                         HOFFMAN
          We're still trying to reach him.
          Anything on Kerry?

                         RIGG
          No. We're still working the access
          door on the lower-level. Maybe
          something's in there.
          Hoffman stares at the warehouse. He begins to slide his
          hands into a fresh set of latex gloves.

                         HOFFMAN
          Nobody touches John Kramer or Amanda
          Denlon . Those bodies are to be left
          idle until my order.

                         RIGG
          Understood.
          A black sedan glides to a stop at the perimeter of the crime
          scene. A wake of dust envelopes the TWO DARK SUITS that
          emerge from the car.

                         RIGG (CONT'D)
          Who are they?
          A DUTY OFFICER approaches the two dark suits.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fresh authority.
          FROM HOFFMAN'S P.O.V. : A man raises his FBI I.D. BADGE.
          This is FBI AGENT PETER STRAUM (40s). He has slits for eyes
          and a strong build that is hidden under his perfect black
          suit.
          The second agent steps forward, she shakes the Duty Officer's
          hand. This is FBI AGENT LINDSEY PEREZ (late 20s) with her
          tightly pulled back hair and plain black suit she tries to
          hide her beauty, but it's the first thing most notice.
          11.
          The Duty Officer turns and points to Hoffman.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)

                         (TO RIGG)
          Get back to that access door and let
          me know the second we can pop it.

                         RIGG
          Yes, sir.
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Detective Hoffman?
          Hoffman turns, seeing the two FBI agents.

                         HOFFMAN
          Yeah.

                         STRAUM
          This is Special Agent Lindsey Perez,
          and I'm Special Agent Peter Straum.
          Perez extends her hand to Hoffman. They shake. Straum makes
          no such offer. Instead, he "clicks" a PEN over and over.

                         PEREZ
          Captain Chang spoke very highly of
          you. We're both looking forward to

                         WORKING--

                         STRAUM

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          Where are the bodies, Detective?
          Hoffman takes a look between Perez and Straum.

                         HOFFMAN
          Inside. Did the Captain inform you
          of what we found?

                         STRAUM
          Yes.
          Straum turns, moving towards the building. Perez sort of
          shrugs to Hoffman, offering a crooked smirk.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER
          Hoffman leads Strum and Perez down a corridor. Forensics
          and duty officers move about. There are BODIES or PIECES
          being pulled out of the many rooms.

                         HOFFMAN
          You both are familiar with the case,
          right?
          12.
          Hoffman turns, a gurney slides his way. It is the thawing
          body of DANICA (from the freezing room).

                         PEREZ
          Yes. The Bureau has been following
          it for some time.

                         HOFFMAN
          And have you ever seen anything like
          quite like this before?
          Danica's blue arm drops from the body bag. A LAYER OF ICE
          slides off her flesh like a crystal sleeve.

                         STRAUM
          One case comes to mind. Some
          similarities.

                         HOFFMAN
          Similarities how?
          Rigg's voice breaks over Hoffman's walkie-talkie.
          RIGG (V.O.)

                         (FROM WALKIE-TALKIE)
          The access door is about to open,
          sir.

                         HOFFMAN

                         (INTO WALKIE-TALKIE)
          I'm coming, hold right there.
          Hoffman turns, leading the way. But Straum and Perez duck
          their heads into the room where Danica's body was taken out
          of.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE FREEZER -- CONTINUOUS
          The abandoned meat locker is a thawed wasteland of milky
          vapor and dirt-packed slush. The apparatus that held Danica
          glimmers.
          Straum and Perez give the crime scene a once over before
          ducking out again.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE KILLING FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS
          Hoffman's pace accelerates. Straum and Perez keep up. Their
          eyes burn from the pungent odors of the pig remains.
          Straum is absorbing every inch of the journey. He keeps
          "clicking" his pen.
          13.

                         HOFFMAN
          You may want to hold your breath.
          This next room...

                         STRAUM
          We've done this before.

                         PEREZ
          Thank you, Detective.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE RACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          The mechanical cross that recently twisted TIM apart limb by
          limb stands silently. It is crusted with Tim's fluids.
          Most of Tim has been removed from the device. Most of him.
          Perez blinks away a gut-churning reaction. Straum keeps
          pace. Nodding a little to himself.

                         STRAUM
          Interesting.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS
          Hoffman turns on a flashlight and slips down a dark narrow
          stairway. Perez and Straum are right behind.

                         HOFFMAN
          Watch your step.
          The lights of Rigg's team glow at the base of the stairwell.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Rigg?
          Rigg stands before the ACCESS DOOR. It has been cut at the
          hinges. Pried at the top and bottom.

                         RIGG
          On your command, sir.

                         HOFFMAN
          Take it down.
          The access door hits the ground. Dust and steam dissipate.
          Hoffman boldly steps through the armed SWAT team...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS
          Kerry's dead body. Greatly DECAYED. Many months. Rib cage
          ripped open. A skeletal angel, rotted from the wings down.
          Hoffman takes in the scene. Straum and Perez step in behind.
          14.

                         RIGG
          Is it her?

                         HOFFMAN
          Yes.
          Straum stops "clicking" his pen.

                         STRAUM
          Kerry Sayer?

                         HOFFMAN
          Yes. Missing six months.
          Hoffman stares at his colleagues dead body.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          She was our best shot at catching
          Jigsaw.

                         STRAUM
          Well, you got him now.

                         HOFFMAN
          Yeah.

                         RIGG
          Sir, should we attempt to inform him
          now?
          Hoffman's eyes move to Rigg. And he turns away from Kerry's
          body.

                         HOFFMAN
          No, not just yet. He'll want to see
          her, and I'm not going to let him
          see her like this.
          Hoffman turns, moving to the exit when--
          PEREZ (O.S.)
          She didn't have a chance, you know.
          Hoffman turns back to Perez.

                         PEREZ (CONT'D)
          The lock's open. She got out. But
          this was built for her execution.
          It belied the rules.
          They all look to the trap.

                         HOFFMAN
          It's sadistic.
          15.

                         STRAUM
          Where's the accomplice?

                         HOFFMAN
          In the back room.
          Hoffman motions with his head, leading them out.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE SICK ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          Hoffman, Perez and Straum absorb the room. The blue prints,
          the instruments, the bodies of the final showdown lay still.
          A CORONER stands by. The body bags ready to be filled.
          Amanda still holds the handgun. Her body slumped.
          Perez kneels next to Lynn's headless body.
          Straum moves about the room with latex gloves on. He looks
          to all the dead bodies, examining them.

                         STRAUM
          Alright, where is he?

                         HOFFMAN
          Who?

                         STRAUM
          Jigsaw's accomplice. Captain Chang
          said Jigsaw's accomplice was here as
          well.
          Hoffman eyes shift to Amanda's dead body.

                         HOFFMAN
          You're standing right next to her.
          Straum looks to Amanda. His eyes then glance to Perez.

                         PEREZ

                         DETECTIVE--
          Straum motions to Perez, stopping her. He moves closer to
          Hoffman, snapping off his latex gloves.

                         STRAUM
          We both saw your colleague Kerry
          strung up in the other room, right?
          Hoffman nods.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          And you can see the bedridden cancer
          patient lying dead behind me, right?
          16.

                         HOFFMAN
          You want to get to your point, Special
          Agent?

                         STRAUM
          Take a look at Jigsaw's "accomplice."
          Hoffman looks to Amanda.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          How much do you think she weighs?
          Hundred? Hundred ten pounds?
          Hoffman doesn't reply.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Well, you want to tell me how a
          hundred ten pound woman is able to
          carry a person more than her body
          weight and hoist that person precisely
          onto a rack of hooks?
          (off Hoffman's gaze)
          And I haven't even mentioned the
          physical strength needed to develop,
          construct, and operate the museum of
          death and dismemberment we just walked
          through.
          Straum is nearly nose to nose with Hoffman.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Now, let me ask you. Where is
          Jigsaw's accomplice?
          There's a beat between the two men.

                         HOFFMAN
          There's something you should see,
          Special Agent.

                         STRAUM
          Show me.
          Hoffman breaks the gaze, turning and exiting the room. Straum
          and Perez exchange a look. She follows Hoffman.
          Straum drops his gloves, stepping towards Amanda and leaning
          down and ripping the KEY from around her neck.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- MONITOR ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          Hoffman stands over a stack of MANILLA FOLDERS laid out on
          the desk. They're the research files for all the CURRENT
          VICTIMS in the lair (Tim, Danica , Holden , etc.).
          17.

                         HOFFMAN
          Each victim was studied, abducted,
          and put into a game of death.

                         (BEAT)
          As of today, there are an additional
          sixteen individuals classified as
          "missing" throughout the city. These
          individuals could have skipped town,
          fallen off a pier, or passed out
          drunk in some alleyway.
          Hoffman glances to Straum.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Or, these individuals could be in
          similar predicaments as the victims
          here. We don't know.
          (beat, motioning)
          John Kramer and Amanda Denlon are
          back in that room dead. But you
          suspect that there is an additional
          accomplice out there? Maybe there
          is, Agent Straum.
          Hoffman pulls out a FOLDER from underneath the pile. It's
          the FOLDER and PHOTO for SPECIAL AGENT PETER STRAUM.
          Straum and Perez stare at the folder.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          And perhaps you're the man who's
          supposed to find out.
          INT. LAW FIRM -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATE DAY
          A well-groomed man with fashionable glasses and slick suit
          sits at a desk covered with papers and files. This is
          ATTORNEY BROWN (50s).
          Mr. Brown is lax, needling as he lazily flips papers.
          ATTNY. BROWN
          With the completion of these documents
          the division of assets can commence.
          In this case however, without
          substantial assets to divide, we
          would focus on the outstanding debt
          that was accumulated while the
          marriage was in effect.
          Mr. Brown is talking with a blond woman with mismatch clothes,
          bags under her eyes, and hair that hasn't seen a stylist in
          months. This is GLORIA (30s).
          18.

                         GLORIA
          Division of debt? Are you serious?
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          And how do you earn ten percent of
          nothing?
          Both eyes in the room turn to the familiar voice.
          And we get a look at him. Pale skin, gaunt, unshaven. This
          is what's left of DETECTIVE ERIC MATTHEWS .
          He's twitchy, sitting in a chair, huddled to one side and
          unable to keep still.
          ATTNY. BROWN
          Well, Mr. Matthews , that depends.
          Your son, Daniel, is enrolled in a
          private school. That tuition could
          be used to--

                         GLORIA
          That's not going to happen. It's my
          mother's money that pays for Daniel's
          education. It won't be touched.

                         ERIC
          What do you propose, Mr. Brown?
          Want me to just take it on? Is that
          my role in this? Is that why I am
          here today? Why not? Alimony not
          cutting it? Like I need more of
          this shit.

                         GLORIA
          Oh, god.
          Gloria unconsciously rolls her eyes and grabs her pack of
          cigarettes from her oversized purse.
          ATTNY. BROWN
          There's no smoking in here, Mrs.
          Matthews .
          RING-RING-RING! Eric's CELL PHONE rings on his hip. He
          instantly stops his conversation and reaches for it, checking
          the number.

                         GLORIA
          That's right, Eric. Take the call.

                         ERIC
          Get off my back, would you? I'm
          doing everything I can here.
          19.
          Gloria's about to burst. And not being able to smoke is too
          much. She stands, moving from the office.

                         GLORIA
          Yeah. And that's not much. Fuck
          you, Eric.
          Eric rises to stop her.
          ATTNY. BROWN
          Mr. Matthews , I don't mean to intrude--

                         ERIC
          Then don't!
          Eric's tone, stops Mr. Brown. Eric's eyes drop to his cell.
          He doesn't answer.
          Eric collects himself.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Look...just don't move.
          Eric bolts from the room.
          EXT. LAW OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
          Gloria barges from the law office, moving quickly. Eric is
          right behind, grabbing her shoulder as she clears the doorway.

                         ERIC
          Gloria! Gloria, stop--
          She pushes him away.

                         GLORIA
          Don't! Don't you touch me!

                         ERIC

          Gloria's about to storm away, but she doesn't.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          I don't want to fight with you. But
          these people...
          He motions back to the office.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          They pit us against each other.
          They take what's already difficult
          and just ram it down our throat.
          20.

                         GLORIA
          Is it them, Eric? Is it always really
          them?

          Baby...

                         GLORIA
          I can't do this. Every time I see

          I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I don't
          want it to be like this either.
          Eric moves closer to Gloria, putting his arms around her.
          She isn't so sure at first, but she eventually lets him.

                         GLORIA
          You still think about her, don't
          you?
          Eric stammers.

                         GLORIA (CONT'D)
          Don't you?

                         ERIC
          Please... just try to--
          Gloria leans her head into his chest and then, she pushes
          him away, shaking her head.

                         GLORIA
          No. No. No. You're always sorry.
          I'm always sorry. We're just damaged.
          And the more time we spend together
          isn't going to fix that. It won't.
          Gloria holds up her hands, keeping him away.

                         GLORIA (CONT'D)
          It's not...
          Gloria turns, moving away.

                         ERIC
          Where are you going?

                         GLORIA
          I'm going to my home, Eric.

                         (BEAT)
          Danny's calling tonight. Someone
          has to be there for him.
          21.
          Eric moves to follow her. But stops. He settles.
          Eric turns to reenter the law office when a MAN bursts through
          the doors and BUMPS RIGHT INTO HIM.
          Eric nearly falls over, and the man keeps going.

                         MAN
          Watch it.
          Eric can't see the man's face with a skull cap on and jacket
          collar turned up.

                         ERIC

                         HEY--
          RING-RING-RING! Eric's cell phone rings again. He's
          distracted, looking to the number.
          He looks back to his distancing wife. Too far gone. Eric
          answers the phone.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Yeah, what is it?!
          Eric's eyes slowly change from anger to concern as he listens
          to the person on the other end.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- HALLWAY -- LATER
          CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP! A brown boot and a heavy METAL FOOT make
          their way down a dank hallway.
          It's Eric. And the results of his time with Jigsaw are seen.
          He uses a cane, and his metal foot hitting the floor declares
          his entrance anywhere.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric peaks around the corner to the examination room. Straum,
          Perez, and the Coroner stand around a body on a table.
          Hoffman, holding a CELL PHONE, tries to get reception.

                         HOFFMAN
          Hello?
          (re: cell phone)
          Damn it...
          Eric takes a step into the room, being spotted by Hoffman

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Eric.
          22.

                         ERIC
          Did you find her?
          Hoffman's face sinks. He nods.

                         HOFFMAN
          Eric. You don't want--

                         ERIC
          Is that her?
          A body bag sits on a slab. Kerry's name is visible.
          Straum and Perez watch Eric.
          Eric softly touches Kerry's body bag. A strand of hair pops
          up through the zipper.
          Eric raises his head. He sees Amanda's body. Just ahead.
          Under a sheet.
          Eric shambles forward. He's rattled.

                         HOFFMAN
          Eric...
          Eric puts a finger up to silence Hoffman.
          Eric pulls back the sheet. Amanda's corpse looks up at him.
          His face is a plague of horrid memories.
          Straum loudly exhales. His pen "clicks." Perez nudges him.

                         ERIC
          Does someone want to tell me who the
          fuck is staring at my back?

                         HOFFMAN
          This is Special Agent Straum and
          Special Agent Perez from the FBI.

                         ERIC
          Yeah, I could tell from the suits.

                         HOFFMAN
          They're here to help out, Eric.
          A CORONER in scrubs clears his throat and looks to Eric.
          They've been examining JIGSAW'S BODY.
          Eric looks to Jigsaw. His eyes tighten. It's the man who
          nearly took his son. His life.
          23.

                         ERIC
          This is a cleanup job now, what do
          we need help for?
          Straum exchanges a look with Perez. He steps forward, pulling
          back the sheet over Jigsaw's torso.
          CLOSE ON : In black paint, there's a QUESTION MARK, and written
          below it is, " MATTHEWS ."

                         STRAUM
          You tell us, detective.
          Eric gulps.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          The Coroner does the delicate work.
          CLOSE ON : The scalpel cuts into Jigsaw's torso.
          The Coroner fishes around, letting his hands do the searching.
          Then, he pulls something out.
          It's a small WAX BALL.

                         CORONER
          This was in his stomach.

                         PEREZ
          What is it?

                         CORONER
          Wax.

                         HOFFMAN
          Why would he swallow wax?

                         ERIC
          To protect what's inside from stomach
          acid.
          Eric slides a ZIPPO LIGHTER from his pocket.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          We gotta melt it out.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          CLOSE ON : The Zippo fires to life. The Coroner holds the
          wax ball, gently burning it down.

                         HOFFMAN
          Careful, doc.
          24.
          All eyes stay on the melting wax ball.
          RING-RING-RING! Hoffman's cell phone goes off. He looks to
          it, moving away to answer.
          Straum looks to Eric. Their eyes connect. And neither looks
          away.

                         STRAUM
          Why you?

                         ERIC
          Because he's a sick fuck--

                         PEREZ
          Or because you didn't finish your
          game. He didn't "fix" you.

                         ERIC
          Oh no?
          Eric's gaze drops to his METAL FOOT.

                         STRAUM
          What happened, Detective Matthews ?
          Why'd he spare your life?
          Eric's eyes twitch ever so slightly and...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- SEWER (FLASHBACK)
          THE FOLLOWING IS A HYPER CUT NIGHTMARE.
          Amanda, bloodied and overcome with rage, moves back to Eric.

                         ERIC
          You're not Jigsaw, bitch--
          She pummels him with furious blows.
          Amanda handcuffs Eric's arms around a pipe, hitting him one
          last time for good measure. She spits on him.

                         AMANDA
          Enjoy the ride down, cocksucker ...
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATE DAY

                         PRESENT

                         ERIC
          I... I don't know.
          25.
          HOFFMAN (O.S.)
          Goddamn it.
          Eric looks to Hoffman. Hoffman lost his call and he's trying
          to find a spot where his cell works.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Reception down here is for shit.
          Eric tosses his CELL PHONE to Hoffman without missing a beat.
          The focus shifts back to the melting wax. The wax is coming
          off, and it's revealed as a MICRO-CASSETTE TAPE.

                         CORONER
          It says, "Play Me."
          The Coroner grabs the MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER over his
          examining table and puts in the tape.
          Tape hiss crackles to life. Every eye in the room dances
          between the recorder and the people standing opposite them.
          That bone-chilling rasp fills the air.
          Jigsaw.
          JIGSAW (V.O.)

                         (FROM TAPE)
          Greetings, and welcome. Some in
          this room are no longer of this world.
          While others wish they had gone long
          ago. Now, there's a final game to
          be played to determine which path we
          all will take, and at the end, an
          understanding will be reached. An
          understanding you will know by the
          trail of the dead.

                         (BEAT)
          All the pieces will soon come
          together, and the purpose, the reason,
          will soon be understood. But with
          clarity will come sacrifice, a
          sacrifice that not all will be able
          to make.

                         (BEAT)
          Detective Matthews , your participation
          has been integral. In our time
          together, you came so far, but you
          didn't fully learn to cherish what's
          so precious in life. You still harbor
          your rage, and you still push away
          those that try to help you.

          26.
          JIGSAW (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                         (BEAT)
          Today is your second conception.
          You will reach an ultimate
          comprehension, and we'll both be
          able to finish what we started so
          many years ago.
          The tape hiss returns... until it finally clicks to a stop.
          Straum and Perez glare into Eric. But Eric's head swims.
          So many memories bombarding his brain.
          It's all coming back. The terror. The suffering. The pain.
          Eric turns, grabbing his cell phone back from Hoffman and
          exiting the office.

                         ERIC
          Bury this fuck, his bitch, and his
          goddamn tapes. I'm going home.
          Straum "clicks" his pen as Eric limps out.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          Eric moves down a dingy street on the way back to his
          apartment. Jigsaw's words still buzz in his ear.
          A LIGHT RAIN falls.
          Eric's eyes flutter, and his mind takes him back to...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- SEWER (FLASHBACK)
          Eric's beaten to a pulp. Left for dead. His arms stuck in
          the handcuffs. His head hanging. Blood flowing down his
          face.
          Then, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's JIGSAW.
          Jigsaw kneels by Eric, pulling back his black hood, exposing
          his own beaten face.

                         JIGSAW
          It's not yet your time, Detective.
          Jigsaw, John Kramer , grabs Eric by the busted ankle.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric moves across the street to enter a FOUR-STORY WALKUP,
          having to step over some BUM lying in the doorway.
          27.
          INT. POLICE STATION -- CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
          A large, bulldog of a man, CAPTAIN CHANG (40s), sits behind
          a desk decorated with medals and plaques.
          Straum and Perez stand, moving around the room. The walls
          are glass, looking out into an officer bullpen.

                         PEREZ
          Jigsaw's talking directly with him,
          Captain.

                         STRAUM
          If he isn't brought in for his own
          safety then he ought to be brought
          in for questioning.

                         CHANG
          After what he's been through, to

                         EVEN SUSPECT--

                         PEREZ
          We understand that, and that's why
          we came to you first. But it's on
          the tape, Captain.

                         STRAUM
          And there are still three days
          unaccounted for that Detective
          Matthews and Jigsaw spent together
          at a location that has yet to be
          discovered.

                         CHANG
          He's told us everything he can
          remember.

                         PEREZ
          Captain, how did he return?

                         CHANG
          He didn't return...
          EXT. POLICE STATION -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)
          A large, blood-stained burlap sack sits out front the police
          station.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          He was delivered.
          Rigg and his team approach. A bomb squad is right there.

          Stand down! Stand down!
          On top of the sack, Eric's POLICE BADGE glimmers like a
          greeting card.

                         RIGG (CONT'D)
          We need an ambulance!

                         CHANG
          I don't know what's left of the former
          Detective Eric Matthews . Not much.
          INT. HOSPITAL -- OPERATING ROOM -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)
          Eric is rushed into a room of doctors. LYNN pushes through
          the doors, scrubs on.

                         ERIC
          Daniel... Daniel...

                         LYNN
          I need you to calm down. You're
          going to be okay.

                         (TO ANESTHESIOLOGIST)
          We need to stabilize...
          Eric head sways back and forth.
          FROM ERIC'S P.O.V. : The doctors and nurses are all wearing
          PIG MASKS.

                         ERIC
          NO! GET BACK!
          ERIC'S body surges. Lynn holds him.

                         LYNN
          Keep him down!

                         PRESENT

                         CHANG
          The day Detective Matthews returned
          was also the day his colleague, Kerry,
          was abducted. When he finally came
          to it was the first thing he heard.
          29.
          INT. HOSPITAL -- ROOM -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          Chang stands with head dropped. Eric smashes up the room.
          He's adrenalined . An animal.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          Detective Matthews was first held at
          a different location. He thought
          that if he could just get us there,
          to where he was, Kerry could be saved.
          EXT. THE HOUSE (FLASHBACK)
          Eric leads the way. SWAT, officers, the works...charge in.
          INT. THE HOUSE -- WAKE-UP ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          The bodies of the previous players decorate the location.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          But it wasn't the right location.
          INT. BATHROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Xavier's rotting body. Jeff's foot. Adam's corpse. A
          gruesome mosaic of lost life.
          Eric can barely look into the room.

                         ERIC
          She has to be here... she has to....

                         CHANG
          It was but another mausoleum. And
          it could be anywhere out there.
          This city's been dying for decades.
          We've got buildings rats won't even
          shit in all over this town.

                         (BEAT)
          And any place could have been the
          next crypt.
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- STAIRWAY -- NIGHT
          Eric climbs the stairs to the THIRD FLOOR, huffing for air.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          That was six months ago. Since then,
          Detective Matthews has stuck pretty
          close to his desk, pouring over the
          files.
          30.
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- OUTSIDE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric moves down the hallway, towards his apartment, limping
          with every step.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          I hope today represents the end of
          this whole goddamn mess.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- BODY STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT
          There's a long, thin hallway with stark white lighting. A
          gurney is wheeled down the hallway.
          The Coroner is doing the pushing. Taking his own sweet time.
          CHANG (V.O.)
          I see that tape as a remnant of a
          bygone time. A curio.
          The long hallway opens up to the room for storing the dead
          bodies. The walls are dotted with METALLIC PULLOUT DRAWERS.
          The Coroner opens one, transferring JIGSAW'S BODY from the
          gurney to the pullout metal drawer.
          He closes the drawer, slamming closed the door. With a BLACK
          MARKER, he writes the name on the outside card.

          Jigsaw, as we knew him, is now but a

          So how did Jigsaw get his information?
          How did he know so much about the
          victims?

                         STRAUM
          He had access to classified

          You think Detective Matthews is

          NED is strapped to the chair as two drill approach his neck.
          SING, in a standoff with TAPP and Jigsaw, shoots the two

          Ned Baker. Petty car thief. Addict.
          Typical lowlife scum.

          Not worth the loss of a good cop.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR UPPER LEVEL (FLASHBACK)

          Missing. Just like sixteen others.
          Chang to the officer bullpen.
          There's an entire wall dedicated to the sixteen missing people
          Hoffman spoke of. SIXTEEN MUGSHOTS stare back at Straum and

          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
          The door opens, casting light into Eric's spartan apartment.
          Eric enters, closing the door behind him.
          CLOSE ON : His feet move along the floor, passing a slack
          METAL TRIP WIRE across the living room floor entryway.

          Eric moves down the hallway towards the kitchen.

          Eric enters, moving towards the refrigerator and opening it.
          CLOSE ON : Inside the fridge. Not much.
          Eric grabs a carton of orange juice, tipping it back and
          takes a drink.
          Eric's eyes rise to the ceiling, seeing something along the
          crease of the ceiling and wall.
          He lowers the orange juice carton, looking.
          CLOSE ON : It's the thin metal trip wire. Running along the
          crease, almost invisible in the dark room.
          On the wall behind Eric, there's a mounted CROSS BOW-like
          device pointing back down the hallway towards the front door.
          But before Eric can turn and see it--
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)

                         (FAINT)
          Ahh...
          Eric flinches, DROPPING the juice carton on the floor.
          He instinctually grabs his HANDGUN from his shoulder holster,
          looking towards the living room.
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
          Eric eases down the hallway, his handgun leading the way.
          He looks for anything out of place.
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)

                         (DISTORTED)
          Help...
          33.
          Eric's handgun aims into the living room.
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          The walls are papered with JIGSAW NEWSPAPER ITEMS. Not a
          spot of paint. But that's not what gets his eye.
          It's a rail-thin businessman with white hair and reddish
          face. He's bound to a chair with a strap across his forehead
          holding his head against the chair back.
          This is BERNARD (40s).
          Bernard's mouth is held wide open by a DENTAL DEVICE. Metal
          wires zig-zag between his teeth, connected to a trip wire
          that is connected to METAL COLLAR DEVICE.
          The collar device is like a CIGAR CUTTER. Yet, in this case,
          the cigar is Bernard's neck.
          Currently, the blades on either side of the device are open.
          But trip the wire, the blades will snap together and pop off
          Bernard's head.

                         BERNARD
          Help... help... help...
          Eric takes a step towards Bernard, snagging a TRIP WIRE. It
          runs to a TV in the corner of the room.

                         ERIC
          Fuck!
          ZZCCCCCHHH !
          The TV flashes to life. And from the static comes an image.
          The doll.

                         DOLL

                         (FROM SCREEN)
          Hello, Eric. And welcome home.
          (an ironic chuckle)
          Now, the clock starts ticking on
          your final game. Before you sits a
          man deserving of death. A disgraced
          man convicted of peddling what he
          was once trusted to prescribe.

                         (BEAT)
          He's but a stop in the road for you.
          His life means nothing. But within
          him is the key that you'll need to
          advance. This man is but one of
          four obstacles that you will have to
          overcome in order to succeed.

                         (MORE)
          34.

                         DOLL (CONT'D)

                         (BEAT)
          Look closely, Eric.
          ON TV: The doll image flashes away. It's replaced with a
          woman standing on a BLOCK OF ICE with NOOSE around her neck.
          It's GLORIA. Eric's ex-wife.
          Eric's eyes strain.

                         ERIC
          You fuck...
          ON TV: Back to the doll.

                         DOLL
          Your ex-wife, Gloria, has ninety
          minutes before the block of ice she
          stands upon melts and she hangs to
          death.

                         (BEAT)
          You have a choice, Eric. You can
          either let the man in front of you
          die, collect the key within him, and
          move on to the next location. Or
          you can try to save him, and lose
          precious time in the process.

                         (BEAT)
          However, saving him will take a steady
          hand. The wires within his mouth
          are live. If touched, the device
          around his neck will be sprung. The
          only way to free the man... the key.
          The only clue to the next location...
          the key. The only chance to save
          your wife... the key.

                         (BEAT)
          Are you a killer or are you a hero,
          Eric? The choice is yours.
          The image cuts, and the TV goes black.
          POP-POP-POP! Eric jerks back as a row of CHERRY BOMBS ring
          out like gunshots and destroy the TV.
          Behind Eric, a SINKER AND LINE drops into place across the
          front doorway.
          Eric sees the trip wire by the living room entryway floor.
          It's now tight. Active.
          Eric's eyes rise to above the door.
          THREE SPIKED MACES are held into place with a SPRING TRAP.
          Trip the wire and it's a spiked mace to the face.
          35.
          On the far wall, there's a MOUNTED CAMERA. Next to that is
          a DIGITAL CLOCK. It turns on and the clock reads down from
          NINETY MINUTES.

                         ERIC
          No... no... no...
          The smoke from the cherry bombs and the busted TV drift up
          to a SMOKE ALARM.
          It rings out.
          Eric grips his head, his emotions overwhelming.
          He rips out the smoke alarm and hurls into the clock. The
          clock shatters.

          Chang shakes his head, looking at the files in front of him.

          Eric screams at the top of his lungs, hitting the pictures

          Bernard stares, trying not to move his mouth and set off the
          collar device.

                         ERIC
          Fuck... fuck... fuck...

          CLOSE ON : A KEY hangs from the back of Bernard's throat.
          From the UVULA. But it's jailed by the many wires.
          Bernard mumbles, trying to will Eric with his eyes to do the
          right thing and help him.
          Eric grabs the TWEEZERS placed on the top of the chair. He
          eases it towards Bernard's mouth but--
          HIS HANDS SHAKE LIKE HELL.
          Bernard mumbles. Eric recoils and swings at the air.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Fuck!!!
          Eric keeps his back to Bernard, trying to settle himself.
          And after a beat--

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          I'm going to save you, okay?
          Bernard doesn't make a peep. Eric turns.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Okay?
          Bernard mumbles, as if saying "okay."
          Eric moves forward again, raising the tweezers and moving
          them towards Bernard's mouth.
          It's like a game of OPERATION. Touch the metal, and the
          buzzer goes off.
          Eric's hand trembles, but he's able to keep the tweezers
          steady. It slides between two wires and into Bernard's mouth--

          A half dozen cop cars screech to a halt in front of Eric's

          Two arrows plunge into the SWAT body armor. But one of the

          Rigg pulling him back to safety.

          The two remaining SWAT members train their rifles on Eric,
          the RED LASER DOTS bouncing off his face.
          Eric stands with his hands inches from Bernard's trapped
          face.

          Too late. The trip wire is pulled. And the THREE MACES
          swing down, smashing the faces of the two SWAT members.
          Instant death as they fall back, letting off a few rounds.
          BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The errant shots plunge into the CEILING,
          causing the ASBESTOS CEILING to crumble and come down like a
          DUSTY SNOW. The mounted camera blows into smoke and sparks.
          Eric moves and--
          The collar device CLAMPS TOGETHER, popping off Bernard's
          head.
          Bernard's body slides out from the collar device, falling to
          the floor.
          BLAM-BLAM! Two more errant shots from the SWAT members.
          They miss Eric as he falls back.

          She'll be dead by the time you

          Eric dives for Bernard, rolling him up--
          BLAM-BLAM! Two shots plunge into Bernard's dead body.
          Straum stumbles over the two dead SWAT members on the floor.
          The only way out of the living room is past the six people
          in the entryway.
          Eric grabs the key. Hoists up Bernard and he sprints for
          the WINDOW ON THE FAR WALL.
          BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Shots ring out at Eric. But they hit
          Bernard, Eric's human shield.
          Eric rams through the LARGE GLASS WINDOW with Bernard's body

                         AND--

          BAM! Eric and Bernard both land on the roof of a PARKED
          CAR, Eric using Bernard's body as a landing cushion.
          The windows of the car BLOW OUT in a glass explosion, and
          the roof COLLAPSES.

          They barrel towards the shattered window.

          Eric's alive. Beat to shit. But alive. He's able to roll
          from the smashed in car roof, still holding the KEY in hand.
          STRAUM (O.S.)
          Don't move!
          Straum hangs out the window, his handgun aimed.
          But Eric's already on the move, sprinting down the alley as
          best he can with one good foot.
          BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Bullets pepper the cement. But none connect.
          And Matthews is gone around the corner.
          Straum steams, glaring as the drapes flutter in the wind.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
          Matthews moves down the street, ducking in an alleyway. He
          slides off his blood-stained shirt, hiding it in a trash
          can.
          In the distance, the sound of POLICE SIRENS are heard.
          He has to move. The rain's coming down heavier now.
          Eric's eyes drop to the KEY. It's a simple door key. And
          there's a STAMP on it with a NUMBER
          CLOSE ON : The stamp reads, "ALEXANDER MOTEL - #17."
          Eric knows the place. It's nearby.
          41.
          He moves to a SLEEPING BUM covered by makeshift cardboard
          awning, protecting him from the rainy elements.
          Eric coyly grabs a JACKET, moving as the Bum wakes.

                         BUM
          Hey...
          INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
          A lone light bulb swings from a cord in the barren room. No
          windows. Just a metal door with DIGITAL LOCK.
          In the corner, someone sitting in a chair. But upon closer
          look, it's not a person. It's a HARLEQUIN DOLL. Bone white.
          Red circles on the cheeks.
          Of screen, there's a SOUND of whimpering. It's a MAN. And
          he's in bad shape. But he remains UNSEEN.
          The Unseen Man frantically puts on a DIGITAL WATCH.
          Then, the lock on the door POPS OPEN, and the door swings
          open a bit, letting the outside light shoot into the room.
          The Unseen Man rises, moving to the doll and stuffing it
          into a large back pack.
          It's noticed that as the Unseen Man moves, there's a sound
          of METAL CLANGING together.
          The Unseen Man cautiously approaches the door. He peeks out
          and then exits.
          On the floor, there's a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER.
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
          Now a crime scene. Drenched in blood. Bodies under white
          sheets. Forensics already takes pictures.
          Rigg walks up as Straum looks at the many newspaper items on
          the wall.

                         RIGG
          An all points bulletin has been
          issued, he can't get far.

                         STRAUM

                         (TO RIGG)
          You staying on?

                         RIGG
          I've got five dead men. I'm on.
          42.
          Straum turns, lowering his voice and leans into Perez.

                         STRAUM
          You okay?
          Perez nods, and then points to the traps around the apartment.

                         PEREZ
          Why does a guy rig his own apartment
          with traps?

                         STRAUM
          In case it's raided.

                         PEREZ
          But he doesn't have an escape?

                         STRAUM
          (re: busted window)
          He improvised alright.
          Perez sighs.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          We don't know. This could have been
          prep work. Or practice. He could
          be the accomplice or a copy cat. Or
          maybe even, it's revenge. All I
          know is that he didn't stick around
          to fill us in.

                         PEREZ
          He said something about his wife.
          (trying to remember)
          "My wife... my wife... he has my
          wife."

                         RIGG
          Gloria. We've been unable to locate
          her. And Detective Matthews was
          talking about Jigsaw.

                         STRAUM
          Jigsaw is dead.
          Straum points to a GROUP OF PHOTOS. All of the SAME WOMAN.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          I want to see her...
          It's a blond. Pretty. Natural. The woman from Jigsaw's
          SAW 3 flashback. The woman Jigsaw loved. HIS WIFE.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          I want to see Jigsaw's wife.

                         (MORE)
          43.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)

                         (TO RIGG)
          Have Detective Hoffman meet us. I
          need that 20 right now. We are
          rolling.

                         RIGG
          Copy that.
          (into shoulder walkie )
          I need Hoffman ASAP.
          INT. HOFFMAN'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER
          RING-RING-RING! A cell phone rings. Hoffman's quick to
          pick it up off screen.
          HOFFMAN (O.S.)
          Yeah. Alright. Alright.
          Hoffman enters frame, exiting the bedroom and closing the
          door behind him. He's cleaning off his hands.
          He moves down the hallway moving towards the front door.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          I'll be there in ten minutes.
          In the reflection of a HALLWAY MIRROR in an unlit room, a
          PIG MASK WATCHES.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric, with dirty jacket on and hood up, blends into the
          decrepit surroundings.
          It's urban squalor. He fits right in.
          He sees a crummy motel that might have been alright back in
          its heyday, but that was about seventy years ago.
          CLOSE ON : The key. ALEXANDER MOTEL.
          It's a match.
          Eric steps off the curb, but he turns instantly as a POLICE
          CRUISER comes up the street with TWO COPS glaring out.
          Eric hides his face, moving back under an awning with several
          other loitering LOWLIFES.
          The cops look to the line of lowlifes, but they don't even
          notice Eric, moving on down the block.
          Eric steps from the awning, keeping his head down.
          44.
          INT. MOTEL -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER
          Dirty. The decay of little or no maintenance eats at the
          wall. A hanging light flickers.
          Eric stops at ROOM 17. Looks familiar. Didn't Dr. Gordon
          come here in SAW 1?
          He pulls out his HANDGUN from his shoulder holster and tries
          the key.
          CLOSE ON : The key enters the lock. Perfect fit. It turns...
          Unlocking the door.
          Eric looks left to right and pushes on the door. But it's
          STUCK. Clearly, nothing good is going to come from him
          forcing the door.
          He doesn't have a choice. Eric grips his handgun, takes a
          deep breath, and PUSHES OPEN THE DOOR...
          INT. MOTEL -- ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          BANG! The florescent light on the ceiling pops on,
          illuminating the room.
          The walls and ceiling are covered with SOUND FOAM. In the
          corner is a TV. A MOUNTED CAMERA hangs from the ceiling.
          And a DIGITAL CLOCK is on the wall.
          CLOSE ON : The clock reads 72:18 minutes and dropping...
          A MONITOR sits on a stand. It shows Gloria with noose around
          her neck, standing on the melting ice block.
          Eric's eyes turn to a scraggly man bound in a large chair
          that resembles an electric chair. He has a BALL AND GAG in
          his mouth. He's twitchy. His eyes bugged. TRACK MARKS
          cover his arms.
          This is IVAN (40s).
          But Ivan isn't what catches Eric's eye.
          It's the walls and floor. THOUSANDS OF RUSTY METAL SKEWERS
          of all shapes and sizes stick out.
          It's like a minefield of skewers.
          Eric can't get too close to any wall. He watches each step.
          Ivan starts squirming and making noise. So, Eric's forced
          to close the door, locking it.
          45.
          Eric eyes Ivan. His ARMS and LEGS are bound to the chair
          with BARB WIRE, the blood oozing from his wounds. His head
          is pulled to the chair back by a CHAIN around his neck.
          There's a LOCK holding it in place.
          ZZCCCCCCHH !
          The TV pops on to static. Then, an image comes on. It's
          the doll, turning to look at Eric.

                         DOLL

                         (FROM SCREEN)
          Hello, Eric. I congratulate you on
          the resourcefulness of being able to
          traverse the urban squalor that the
          depraved and addicted call home.
          Appropriately, one wrong step and it
          could be your last.

                         (BEAT)
          The man before you comes from the
          field of listening and helping the
          mentally ill. However, to feed his
          own chemical desires, he's destroyed
          more than he could ever save. He's
          a felon. A pariah. Ruining his own
          life and every other life he's ever
          touched.

                         (BEAT)
          Hidden within this man lies another
          key with dual purposes. It opens
          the lock around his neck, and it
          leads you to your next obstacle.
          Your time should not be spent saving
          him, for he'll kill you if given the
          chance.

                         (BEAT)
          Sixty seconds from now, this man's
          head will be crushed, and his pathetic
          existence will be brought to an end.
          All that will be left is a key, and
          you'll be one step closer to success.

                         (BEAT)
          So, Eric. Will you show pity to the
          incorrigible? Or will you turn a
          deaf ear? The choice is yours.
          The image on the TV goes to static. Then to black.
          An ENGINE, encased in metal, roars to life. It's loud, but
          the sound foam on the walls keeps it exclusive to this room.
          TWO METAL PLATES on either side of Ivan's head start to come
          together. It's a VISE. And it's going to crush Ivan's head.
          46.
          Eric steps forward, avoiding the skewers on the floor. He
          looks to Ivan's head, seeing blood trickling down an EAR.
          THE KEY IS INSIDE.
          Eric takes off Ivan's ball and gag. Ivan coughs, looking to
          the man before him.

                         IVAN
          Are you a cop?

                         ERIC
          Yeah.
          Ivan's eyes widen and strain a bit.
          The vise tightens... close... closer...

                         IVAN
          Okay... okay... Get me out of here!
          Please!
          Eric touches Ivan's bloody ear, causing Ivan to flinch.
          Eric looks around. He needs to move. Eric bends down,
          pulling a SKEWER from the floor.

                         ERIC
          This is going to hurt.

                         IVAN
          Okay... go... go...
          The vise gets closer... closer... closer...
          Eric jams the skewer into Ivan's bloody ear, causing Ivan to
          SCREAM.
          CLOSE ON : The skewer digs into the flesh.
          Eric tries to use a finger, spreading apart the hole.
          Ivan cries horribly.
          The vise tightens... closer.... closer...
          Ivan's head is going to be crushed.
          CLOSE ON : The skewer hooks the key.
          Eric sees it, he digs for it, but the vise is getting too

                         CLOSE--

                         IVAN (CONT'D)
          Come on!!!
          47.
          Eric digs for the key...
          The vise is going to crush Ivan's head when--
          Eric raises his leg and JAMS HIS METAL FOOT BETWEEN THE VISE.
          The engine churns, trying to move but Eric's metal foot is
          keeping it from advancing.
          Eric gets out the key.
          It's bloody as hell, SLIPPING and FALLING ONTO THE FLOOR.

                         ERIC
          Fuck!!!

                         IVAN
          Get it! Get it! Get it!
          Eric leans back, keeping his foot in place. He's barely
          able to grab the key with his outstretched hand.
          But something catches his eye.
          Under the chair, a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER lies covered in
          blood. Discarded. Clearly, Ivan was once holding it.
          Eric reaches for it, but--
          The engine emits a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE. The vise begins to

                         SHAKE--
          Eric scoops up the key--
          He fumbles with the lock--
          Smoke billows from the SCREAMING ENGINE--

                         IVAN (CONT'D)
          Come on!!!
          Eric undoes the lock, yanking Ivan's head forward and his
          foot out of the vise as--
          WHAM! The vise SLAMS TOGETHER, causing the engine to cut
          out.
          The two men gasp, looking to each other.

                         IVAN (CONT'D)
          Thank you... thank you...
          Eric nods, sliding the key into a pocket and untwisting the
          barb wire that binds Ivan's arms and legs to the chair.
          48.

                         ERIC
          I need your help.
          Eric's eyes rise to the clock.
          CLOSE ON : 69:54 and dropping...

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          You have to go to the police. Right
          away. And you have to tell them
          that I helped you. They think I'm
          doing this.
          Eric finishes with the barb wire, totally freeing Ivan. He
          turns and rises, moving for the door.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          I need you to tell them that we're
          both in this game.
          Eric pulls out the KEY, looking to it. It's a brass key.
          No markings. No nothing.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Shit...
          Behind him, Ivan rises. Quivering. Not relieved.
          Instead, Ivan's about to burst. He's clocking Eric.
          Ivan's chest heaves. He touches his back pocket, pulling
          out a STEEL BLADE.
          He's almost shocked to see it. And his bugged eyes rise
          again to Eric.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Hey, there was a tape...
          Eric turns, but Ivan is already LUNGING AT HIM WITH THE BLADE.
          The two lock up. Eric drops the key. They stumble back
          into the door, just missing a SKEWER.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          What the fuck are you doing!?
          Ivan doesn't reply. He's a man possessed. His eyes bulge.
          And he tries to THRUST the blade into Eric's face.
          The blade is pushed closer. Closer.
          Ivan's strong. Incensed.
          49.
          And he pushes the blade within centimeters of Eric's face

                         WHEN--
          Eric spins, using Ivan's own weights to push him into the

                         DOOR SKEWER--

                         IVAN
          Ahh!
          Blood SQUIRTS from Ivan's chest wound.
          Ivan swings the blade back at Eric, but Eric jerks him,
          causing Ivan to stumble backwards and to fall onto a BED OF
          SKEWERS.
          Ivan gasps in pain.
          The skewers jamming into his torso, legs, arms, and the back
          of his head.
          Ivan gargles blood, reaching out for Eric.
          And then, Ivan's life slips away.
          Eric pants, regaining his breath, looking to the BLOOD
          covering his clothes.
          He shakes his head. What the fuck was that?
          Eric's eyes rise to the MOUNTED CAMERA. The red light almost
          mocking him.
          He grits his teeth and moves to the MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER
          under the torture chair.
          Eric grabs it. Presses REWIND and PLAY.
          Tape hiss, and then the familiar distorted voice comes on--
          JIGSAW (V.O.)

                         (FROM TAPE)

          five years to life.

          Make your choice.
          The tape hiss returns. And then it cuts out.
          Eric THROWS the micro-cassette recorder at the mounted camera,
          SHATTERING the recorder into pieces.

                         ERIC
          Fuck you!!!
          Eric then moves to the fallen KEY, picking it up.
          He turns to Ivan, pulling Ivan's WALLET from the back of his
          pants.
          In the wallet, Eric sees a DRIVER'S LICENSE. And Eric now
          has Ivan's home address, and his NEXT LOCATION.
          Eric looks to the mounted camera again.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Try to trick me?! Huh, you fuck?!
          Well, I beat you! I beat your fucking
          game!
          Eric turns, moving to exit the room.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          A square room. The walls and ceiling are COPPER. Only door
          into the room. The floor is COPPER GRATING.
          In the middle, Gloria stands on a BLOCK OF ICE. There's a
          NOOSE around her neck. The ROPE leads to the ceiling.
          On the ceiling, there are a CIRCLE OF BURNERS.
          51.
          Gloria's HANDS are bound behind her back. And she has a
          small CLICKER in her hand.
          She hits the clicker, and the burners TURN ON.
          Gloria tries to move her body so that the rope gets close to
          a burner, but her FREEZING FEET SLIP, and she almost slides
          off the ice cube.

                         GLORIA
          Goddamn it!
          She cries, frustrated. Her emotions flowing.
          With the burners raising the room temperature, the ice cube
          MELTS just a little bit faster.
          Now we understand why the room is copper. Copper is the
          most conductive metal there is. Once the temperature rises,
          it stays there.

                         GLORIA (CONT'D)
          What the fuck are you doing?! Huh?!
          Huh, you crazy asshole?!
          Gloria's yelling to someone in the corner of the room. The
          PERSON sits in front of a BANK OF MONITORS.
          CLOSE ON : The person puts a finger to their lips as if to
          say, " Shhhhh ."
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          Eric exits the motel, putting up his hood to protect his
          face, and to protect it from the raining elements.
          He notices his bloody covered hands, stuffing them into his
          pockets. Eric moves.
          EXT. ALLEYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric ducks down an alleyway. He kneels by a puddle of water,
          hastily rinsing his hands free of the blood.
          As he rises, shaking his hands dry, his eyes connect with a
          FEMALE PASSERBY.
          The Female Passerby stares to Eric. She has a cell phone to
          her ear. She's seen the blood. She's shocked, whispering
          something to the other person on the line.
          Eric turns, seeing a MALE STORE OWNER. The Male Store Owner
          has been watching Eric from his front stoop. He quickly
          turns, reentering his business.
          52.
          Eric turns back down the alley, running.
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
          This isn't Jigsaw's home, it's John Kramer's home. An upper
          middle class home with furnishing from Pier 1 and the like.
          It's a testament to a life of hard work with a touch of class.
          Along the mantle, several photos sit in frames. They're of
          John and his ex-wife, JILL, in happier times. Vacations.
          Family gatherings. Friends. The norm.
          However, no kids.
          There are several framed NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS featuring John.
          He seems to have been a rather prominent person in the past.
          In a chair, Jill sits. Her hands in her lap. Her head
          lowered. An emotional wreck.
          Perez sits close, but Straum moves around the room looking
          at photos and other things.
          Rigg and a few other UNIFORMED OFFICERS hover by the front
          door, their radios squawking.

                         JILL
          I don't know what kind of questions
          you could possibly have now, but
          I've been over this with you all a
          million times before--

                         STRAUM
          Not with us.

                         PEREZ
          Mrs. Kramer --

                         JILL
          It's Jenson . I took back my maiden
          name after the divorce.

                         STRAUM
          Then why keep up all the photos?
          Jill drops her gaze again.

                         PEREZ
          Ms. Jenson , we're concerned for your

                         SAFETY--

                         JILL
          John's dead. (MORE)
          53.

                         JILL (CONT'D)
          And besides, he never would have
          hurt me. He wasn't the monster the
          papers made him out to be.

                         STRAUM
          I've seen a dozen disfigured, burned,
          and dismembered people who would
          disagree with you.
          Jill blinks back a flush of emotion.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          He was a repellent creature printed
          on skin. We want to know why.
          (pointing to a photo)
          Now, who's this guy?

                         JILL
          His old business partner.
          Perez shoots Straum a look like, "shut up." A bites his
          tongue, looking back to the photos.

                         PEREZ
          Ms. Jenson , we're concerned about
          this man.
          Perez pulls out ERIC'S PHOTO.

                         PEREZ (CONT'D)
          Does he look familiar to you?

                         JILL
          I've seen him in the papers.

                         PEREZ
          Besides that. Did your ex-husband
          know him before?

                         JILL
          No. Other than the papers, I've
          never seen him before in my life.

                         PEREZ

                         I SEE--

                         JILL
          John was a loving, gentle man. I
          just don't see how he could have
          done all those things...
          Jill trails out as the corners of her mouth quiver ever so
          slightly. And she looks away, dropping head again.
          54.

                         PEREZ
          Ms. Jenson , you met in college,
          correct?

                         JILL
          Yes. He studied engineering--

                         STRAUM

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          We want to talk about you.
          Jill's nostalgic gaze drops. Being under such pressure is
          new to her.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Tell me about the clinic where you
          used to work. Jigsaw didn't like
          it, right?

                         JILL
          John. His name is John.
          Straum shrugs. Jill takes a moment, gathering her thoughts.

                         JILL (CONT'D)
          He supported me, if that's what you're
          asking, but he was protective, and
          the people there... you know.
          INT. JILL'S CLINIC -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          A chaotic, crowded, non-profit clinic holding on by donations
          and a staff kind enough to give their time.
          Jill's the ring leader, wearing a HEAVY COAT at this point.

                         JILL

                         (MOVING)
          Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
          A NURSE jumps in front of her.

                         NURSE
          Jill, where are the finger splints?

                         JILL
          (pointing and moving)
          Cabinet. Bottom left drawer. Make
          sure to mark it for inventory.
          As Jill turns, wrapping her neck with a scarf, she runs right
          into a YOUNG MOTHER and her LITTLE BOY.
          55.

                         YOUNG MOTHER
          Ma'am, can you help me? My son needs
          his asthma meds and County says I've
          reached my max for the month.
          Jill's eyes move to the waiting area. She sighs.

                         JILL
          No problem.

                         (POINTING)
          That's the sign-in desk, just put
          down your name and someone will be
          right with you.

                         YOUNG MOTHER
          Thank you, thank you so much.
          The Young Mother leads her WHEEZING little boy towards the
          sign-in desk.
          The waiting area is thirty deep. The Young Mother isn't
          going to get help for at least three hours.
          Jill knows it. She turns, seeing the person waiting for
          her.
          It's JOHN.
          He looks good. Healthy. And he wears a smirk. He's been
          watching her.
          In his nicely pressed oxford shirt, blazer, and overcoat,
          he's clearly out of place amongst the uninsured seeking free
          medical treatment.
          Jill stands, her eyes drifting back towards the wheezing
          little boy.
          She looks back to John, her heart breaking for the little
          boy.
          Jill doesn't have to say a word. John knows the routine.
          He smirks, nodding for her to go help him.
          A smile crosses Jill's face, and she mouths, "I love you,"
          blowing him a kiss.
          She moves back to help the little boy.
          John's smile glows, but it lowers as he watches Jill walk
          away.
          Around John, waiting for treatment, a few familiar faces are
          seen.
          56.
          XAVIER with a bloody hand. LAURA. JONAS. None of them
          know each other at this point. Why would they?
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          Jill's head tilts, remembering.

                         PEREZ
          So your marriage fell apart because
          of your job?

                         JILL
          No. John just never understood why
          I'd give so much to people who didn't--

                         STRAUM
          "Cherish their lives?"

                         (BEAT)
          Not exactly the traits of a "loving,
          gentle man," huh, Ms. Jenson ?

                         JILL

                         (STERN)
          He's dead now.
          She stares to Straum, calming herself.

                         JILL (CONT'D)
          You didn't know him. He loved me.
          You don't know half the good he did.
          (off Straum's glare)
          Go ahead, though. Make your analysis.
          Read me. Take that condescending,
          self-righteous tone and classify
          John all you want. You didn't know
          him. You never will.

                         (A BEAT)
          Stop insulting me.
          There's a tense beat as Jill lowers her head again. Perez
          and Straum exchange a look and--

                         RIGG

                         (HUSHED)
          He's been spotted. Downtown.
          Straum moves. Perez puts a hand on Jill's knee.

                         PEREZ
          Thank you for your time, Ms. Jenson .
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          Eric moves down the street. He glances at Ivan's wallet
          once again.
          57.
          He then looks to a DIGITAL CLOCK on the side of a building.
          Eric crosses the street and down some stairs, passing a sign
          that reads, "SUBWAY."
          INT. SUBWAY STATION -- MOMENTS LATER
          It's a sparsely filled platform. Some going home from work.
          And others heading out for the night.
          Eric stands at the end. His hood up. His eyes watching the
          platform for anything threatening.
          All is fine until--
          A UNIFORMED COP comes down the stairs. His radio squawks.
          Clearly, he's looking for someone.
          Eric backs up, hiding himself behind a pillar, watching the
          cop out of the corner of his eyes.
          CLOSE ON : Eric's hand instinctually reaches inside his jacket,
          gripping his shoulder harnessed handgun.
          As Eric's eyes turn away from the cop, there's a TEEN GIRL
          staring right at him. She sees the HANDGUN.
          Her eyes are wide.
          Eric moves away, anxiety now rushing in.
          The cop slowly moves down the platform. He looks to all the
          people, looking under the slickers and rain hats.
          Eric keeps at a distance, trying to coyly move past the cop
          on the opposite side of the platform.
          As the cop moves down the platform, Eric moves up, staying
          behind the pillars.
          Eric's eyes glance back. The Teen Girl is still watching
          him. But she's now whispering to someone else, nodding to
          Eric.
          That person looks to Eric as well.
          Eric has to get the hell out of here. And he knows it.
          He stays behind the pillars, only moving when the cop isn't
          looking. They're about even now.
          Eric holds still, looking back to the Teen Girl. She's
          watching his every move. Her eyes drift to the cop.
          As the cop moves towards the Teen Girl, Eric moves.
          58.
          He doesn't stop this time.
          He keeps his head down, moving for the stairs up to the
          street.
          There's some COMMOTION behind Eric.
          The Teen Girl moves up next to the cop, pointing in Eric's
          direction.
          The cop is suddenly AWARE.
          Eric's close to the stairs. Closer. Closer. Closer.
          He's within ten feet when--
          COP (O.S.)
          Freeze!!!
          Eric stops.

                         COP (CONT'D)
          Do not move! Do not move!
          Eric still has his back to the cop. He raises his hands,
          and he slowly turns around.
          The cop moves up, his hand moving to the walkie-talkie on
          his shoulder when--
          A SUBWAY train barrels into the station.
          A gust of WIND. TRASH fills the air. A strobe of subway
          lights off Eric's face.
          The cop moves closer, barking out orders.
          The PEOPLE on the platform begin to panic, moving away from
          Eric.
          Then, the subway stops.
          And DOZENS OF PEOPLE exit the train, oblivious to what's
          happening on the platform.
          They pass between the cop and Eric.
          And that's all Eric needs--
          He BOLTS for the stairway.

                         COP (CONT'D)
          Hey!!!
          The cop can't shoot. He yells into his walkie-talkie.
          59.
          INT. SUBWAY STATION -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER
          The cop moves through the corridor in chase.

                         COP

                         (INTO WALKIE-TALKIE)
          Officer 1502 in pursuit of Eric
          Matthews coming up from the State
          Street subway station to--
          He takes a corner and--
          WHACK! Eric clobbers him with a fist to the face.
          The cop crumbles to the ground. And before he can recover,
          Eric takes his handgun and handcuffs him to a utility pipe.

                         ERIC
          Do not chase me! I'm in a game!
          (he takes a breath)
          He has my wife, and he's going to
          kill her.
          Eric's eyes rise. There's a CLOCK right over his head.
          Tick-tick-tick.
          Eric rips out the cop's walkie-talkie, throwing it to the
          ground. He tucks the handgun into his waistline, moving
          down the corridor.
          EXT. SUBWAY STATION -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric comes up from the stairs, instantly turning and joining
          a CROWD OF PEOPLE moving along the sidewalk.
          He gets about twenty feet away when two POLICE CRUISERS come
          to a stop at the subway station entrance.
          FOUR COPS jump out, running down the stairs with handguns
          pulled.
          Eric takes a corner, vanishing.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The DIGITAL CLOCK is at 57:46 and dropping.
          Gloria squirms on the block of ice. She has to alternate
          raising her feet so that they don't go totally numb.
          The block of ice is lower. Melting away. And the noose is
          tight now.
          At the bank of monitors, the person sits. There's a HANDGUN
          on the table.
          60.
          And this time, the BLACK CLOAK with RED TRIM is noticed.
          Yet, the person has a CAST cover their entire forearm. Like
          for a broken bone.
          INT. MOTEL -- ROOM -- NIGHT
          The second trap scene. Cops everywhere. Forensics looking
          for clues, carefully making a path free of the skewers.
          The MONITOR with Gloria on it is now a black screen.
          Perez kneels next to Ivan with Rigg over her shoulder.

                         RIGG
          We're sweeping the downtown subway
          stations. No visuals as of yet.
          Straum nods, looking to Perez.

                         STRAUM

                         (RE: IVAN)
          Who is he?

                         PEREZ
          Don't know. But for an innocent
          man, Detective Matthews sure is
          leaving a lot of dead bodies in his
          wake.

                         STRAUM
          If he's tying up loose ends why go
          through the whole routine? Why not
          just put a bullet in the guy's brain?

                         PEREZ
          Creating an alibi?
          Straum nods, motioning to the trap.

                         STRAUM
          This trap mean anything to either of
          you?
          Rigg and Perez both look, shaking their heads.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Jigsaw's used it before. It was in
          the sketches taken from his lair.
          (looking at trap)
          What do you wanna bet there's a sketch
          just like the device in Detective
          Matthews's apartment too?
          61.

                         RIGG
          So why are they showing up now?
          Straum shakes his head as Perez holds up Ivan shirt.

                         PEREZ
          What about this?
          CLOSE ON : A JIGSAW piece taken out of his stomach skin.

                         RIGG
          Trophy, that's what he does.

                         STRAUM
          But why? Why a piece of skin?

                         PEREZ
          My point is that he takes the pieces
          after victims die.

                         STRAUM
          This is Matthews's doing.

                         RIGG
          Or maybe Jigsaw took the piece before
          he died.

                         PEREZ
          No. That'd betray Jigsaw's rules.
          (looks to Rigg)
          What if the victim gets out?

                         STRAUM

                         (TO RIGG)
          Check the guy from Matthews's place.
          See if there's a piece taken.
          Rigg nods, raising his walkie-talkie and moving to the
          hallway.
          Straum stands, rubbing his head and staring at the trap.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          So, if Matthews isn't the accomplice,
          then who is?
          INT. CAR -- NIGHT
          Windshield wipers work overtime to part the heavy rain. A
          HAND sits on the steering wheel, nervously tapping.
          It's the UNSEEN MAN.
          Outside the front windshield, the MOTEL is seen.
          62.
          Several emergency vehicles are lined up on the curb. As is
          Straum and Perez's FEDERAL CAR.

                         UNSEEN MAN

                         (HUSHED)
          There you are.
          The Unseen Man checks his digital watch. His face remains
          hidden, but in the rear view mirror a BLACK CLOAK and METALLIC
          COLLAR DEVICE with DIGITAL CLOCK are seen.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          The streets flood from the rain, and the sewers are backed
          up.
          Eric stands outside a long neglected brick building likely
          once used as a factory. Today, loft apartments.
          A dripping gutter gains Eric's attention. He stares at the
          water, taking his mind back to...
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE SICK ROOM -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          CLOSE ON : A running faucet. A rag is wetted.
          It's Jigsaw. He carries the wet rag over to Eric.
          Eric's on a gurney. His eyes struggling to stay open. The
          rag is put to Eric's bloodied face.

                         ERIC
          Daniel... Daniel...

                         JIGSAW
          He's safe. And you'll see him soon
          enough.
          Eric's head sways, looking down to his FOOT. It's twisted
          in a horrific direction.
          Jigsaw notices.

                         JIGSAW (CONT'D)
          That's not what concerns me, Detective
          Matthews .

                         (TOUCHING HEAD)
          It's what's up here that needs fixing.
          I just hope we'll have enough time.
          Eric's eyes turn, seeing a SCALPEL. He tries to grab it,
          but he's so discombobulated Jigsaw's easily able to block
          his attempt to stab him.
          63.

                         JIGSAW (CONT'D)
          Now you're just being rude.
          Jigsaw plunges a SYRINGE into Eric's arm, making his head
          sway even more and fall back onto the gurney.
          There's a sound of a DOOR OPENING off screen. Jigsaw quickly
          pushes Eric on the gurney in the opposite direction.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- ENTRYWAY -- CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
          Amanda enters holding a half of the METAL RIB CAGE DEVICE
          that will eventually kill KERRY.

                         AMANDA
          It's about ready, John.
          (looks to sick room)
          John?
          Hearing no answer, she turns and moves towards the monitor
          room.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric snaps out of it. He looks back to the building, moving
          across the street.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric steps into the main entryway. He holds out the key,
          looking to the steep stairs that rise into a dark hallway
          one story up.
          He pulls his handgun, climbing the stairs.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric gingerly steps down the hallway, coming to the door
          that is Ivan's loft apartment.
          He holds the key, putting it in the lock.
          But Eric doesn't turn it.
          He knows what lies on the other side of the door. He's done
          this too many times before.
          A decision.
          Eric pulls out the key, bolting back down the hallway.
          64.
          EXT. ALLEYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric's looks up to the windows. He tracks them with his
          eyes, figuring out which one is Ivan's.
          He finds the window. Right next to a FIRE ESCAPE.
          Eric moves to the fire escape ladder, climbing.
          EXT. BRICK BUILDING -- FIRE ESCAPE -- MOMENTS LATER
          Eric crouches by the window. He tries to look in, but the
          drapes are drawn.
          Looking closely, he cases the window border for any type of
          trip wire or whatever.
          There doesn't look to be anything.
          Eric pulls his handgun, BREAKING the glass with the butt.
          He looks around. No lights come on. No one on the street
          to call the cops.
          Eric reaches in, unlocking the window and opening it. He
          slides into the apartment...
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- IVAN'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
          Pitch dark. Only the light from the outside street lamps
          offer any hint at what awaits Eric.
          But Eric isn't stupid. And he's not about to trip some timer
          or death device by turning on the lights.
          He takes out his CELL PHONE from his pocket, turning on the
          LCD SCREEN.
          It offers the SLIGHTEST BIT OF LIGHT.
          Eric takes a step into the sprawling loft apartment and--
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Don't move!
          A scratchy voice nearly causes Eric to discharge his handgun.
          Eric's head whips around to the source of the sound.

                         ERIC
          Who's there?!

                         MALE VOICE
          Eric, it's me, it's me.
          65.
          Eric's eyes tighten, trying to see into the darkness. He
          holds up his cell phone, seeing the outline of a familiar
          face.
          It's HOFFMAN.
          And he's in a trap. His ARMS and LEGS are stretched out and
          chained to a BED FRAME without a mattress.
          His head is held back by a DUAL-ENDED MINI PITCHFORK about
          eight inches long that's jammed into his chin and his upper
          chest.
          It keeps his head back, and it keeps him from turning his
          head.

                         ERIC
          What are you doing here?

                         HOFFMAN
          I'm wondering the same. Get the
          lights.

                         ERIC
          But the trap--

                         HOFFMAN
          The timer's on the door.
          Eric turns, moving for the door.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Careful, Eric. The floor.
          Eric leans down, using the cell phone light to reveal a zig-
          zag of METAL TRIP WIRE.
          He carefully steps over and between the trip wire.
          At the wall, Eric flips a switch, revealing the loft of
          horrors.
          Attached to the metal trip wire are dozens of AX HEADS on
          PENDULUMS held into place on the walls.
          Trip the wire, the ax heads swing down from the twenty-five
          foot ceilings, smashing into your head.
          But that's not what catches Eric's eyes.
          It's Hoffman's trap.
          It's a metal bed frame. There are TWO METAL SLOTS attached
          to the middle of the frame.
          66.
          They rise to the ceiling. And at the top, a GUILLOTINE as
          wide as Hoffman's body is held in place.
          Open the door, the pin is pulled and the TIMER starts.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Hurry, please hurry.
          Eric steps forward. It's almost surreal.
          The trap is yet to be sprung. Everything still.
          The TV in the corner doesn't flash to life.
          The MONITOR with Gloria still black.
          But the MOUNTED CAMERA with red light on sees Eric.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Get me out of this thing.
          Eric turns, stepping through the trip wire.
          He stands next to the bed frame.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Do it fast.
          Eric reaches down to pull out the pitchfork device. Hoffman
          strains, anticipating the pain.
          Eric pulls Hoffman's head back, TWISTING out the pitchfork
          from his chin, and then YANKING it out of his chest.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Jesus fucking christ!
          Hoffman GASPS, the blood SQUIRTING from his two wounds.

                         ERIC
          Where's the key?

                         HOFFMAN
          I don't know... I don't know...
          There's blood covering Hoffman's STOMACH and pooling on the
          floor under the bed.
          Eric pulls back Hoffman's shirt, revealing a JIGSAW PIECE
          taken out of his flesh. It's new. And it's oozing BLOOD.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          67.

                         ERIC
          A jigsaw piece.

                         HOFFMAN
          Jigsaw's dead, who the fuck is doing
          this?

                         ERIC
          I don't know, but he has Gloria.
          Hoffman looks to Eric, shocked.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          I have to get her.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck, man.

                         ERIC
          You don't remember anything?

                         HOFFMAN
          I was at my place. Got jumped... I
          think... I don't know... I hit the
          floor and woke up here.
          There's a beat as Eric looks over Hoffman's body. Hoffman
          looks to Eric.
          Suddenly, Hoffman doesn't know if he trusts Eric.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          How'd you know not to come in through
          the front door?
          Eric looks to him. It's a loaded question.

                         ERIC
          Because I've fallen for that twice
          already today.

                         HOFFMAN
          The person who's doing this has your
          wife. Why am I here?

                         ERIC
          I'll figure that out after I find
          the key.

                         HOFFMAN
          Just shoot off the fucking locks.

                         ERIC
          It'd need more than a 9mm bullet.
          68.
          Hoffman nods, his heart beginning to race as his eyes rise
          to the guillotine high above him.

                         HOFFMAN
          Come on, come on.
          Eric looks to the open wound where the pitchfork was stuck.
          There's something in there.
          Eric leans in.

                         ERIC
          Hold your breath.
          Hoffman nods, holding his breath. Eric moves closer to pull
          out the pitchfork when--

                         HOFFMAN
          Ahh! Goddamn it!

                         ERIC
          What? What?

                         HOFFMAN
          Something pricked my back!
          Eric looks underneath Hoffman. There is a SYRINGE. Stuck
          into Hoffman's back.
          It's attached to a TRIP WIRE that leads all the way to the
          front door. Eric's foot inadvertently pushed it and sprung
          it.

                         ERIC
          Fuck.
          Eric pulls out the syringe, tossing it on the floor.

                         HOFFMAN
          What? What is it?

                         ERIC
          A syringe.

                         HOFFMAN
          What's in it? What the fuck, Eric?

                         ERIC
          Just let me get you out of this thing.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck, Eric! What the fuck was in
          that syringe?!
          69.

                         ERIC
          Relax, man. Relax.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck, man! Come on, come on!
          Eric SHOVES his fingers into the wound. Hoffman GASPS. The
          pain EXCRUCIATING.
          Eric digs for the key.
          And it's too much for Hoffman.
          He lets out an AGONIZING SCREAM.
          Eric's able to pluck out the key. He quickly opens each
          lock on Hoffman, freeing him.
          Hoffman jerks back, covering up and trying to catch his
          breath. He touches his wounds, trying to look to the prick
          in his back.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Goddamn it.
          Eric pulls his handgun, pointing it to Hoffman

                         ERIC
          Don't move.

                         HOFFMAN
          What're you doing, man?

                         ERIC
          Just don't move.
          Eric looks around the bed frame looking for a micro-cassette
          recorder.
          He finds nothing.
          But he still keeps his handgun on Hoffman.
          Eric moves to the front door, pulling the pin.
          The DIGITAL CLOCK turns on. 37:24 and dropping.
          Eric keeps his eyes on Hoffman. His handgun pointed.
          And within a second--
          ZZCCCHHHHHH !!!
          The TV pops onto static. And then an image comes on. The
          doll.
          70.

                         DOLL

                         (FROM SCREEN)
          Hello, Eric. If you've made it this
          far then you're more than halfway to
          achieving your goal.

                         (BEAT)
          You know the man before you. Also a
          detective, he's your partner in crime.
          Over the years, he and you have
          amassed quite a reputation for making
          charges stick even when the evidence
          suggested otherwise.

                         (BEAT)
          Now, you're loyalty to your colleague
          will be put to the test. He has
          been injected with a deadly nerve
          agent and his only chance of survival
          is your ultimate success.

                         (BEAT)
          Within him is the key that you need
          to continue. But move quickly,
          because you have only sixty seconds
          before your relationship will be
          severed for good.
          The TV turns to static again. And then cuts to black.
          The timer on the top of the guillotine instantly STARTS.
          Hoffman simply stares at Eric.
          Eric lowers his handgun.

                         ERIC
          Sorry, had to make sure.

                         HOFFMAN
          A fucking nerve agent?

                         ERIC
          He wants you to come with me.

                         HOFFMAN
          Why?

                         ERIC
          I don't know... we'll find out.
          Eric pulls out the HANDGUN he took from the cop, handing it
          to Hoffman.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          I need you with me.
          71.
          Hoffman looks at the handgun, his hand unconsciously rubbing
          his back where the syringe went in.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck, man.
          Hoffman makes a decision and takes the handgun.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Yeah. Yeah, of course.
          Hoffman tries to offer Eric a smirk, but it's tough under
          the circumstances.

                         ERIC
          Good.
          The two men turn when--
          WHAM! The guillotine slams down.
          Hoffman jumps, his eyes looking at what would have cut him
          in half.
          He exchanges a look with Eric, and they head towards the
          exit.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- ENTRYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
          Next to the front door, there's a FIRE ALARM. Eric pulls
          it, and a BUZZER rings out.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The clock ticks down from 32:19.
          The cloaked figure is now pacing the floor. It's a man.
          But it's impossible to fully see his face.
          He holds the handgun. Looking between the monitors and the
          clock.

                         GLORIA
          He's going to kill you! He's going
          to kill you, you fuck!
          The cloaked figure moves close to Gloria. He puts the handgun
          to her face, causing her to lurch back a bit.
          Her feet slide ever so slightly.
          Then, the cloaked figure lowers the handgun, simply giving
          her a SHOVE--
          The noose TIGHTENS around Gloria's neck.
          72.
          Her feet struggle to get back on the ice block. But they
          SLIP and SLIP.
          Her face REDDENS. The veins in her forehead BULGING.
          She finally gets a foothold, regaining her balance on the
          block of ice.
          But the noose is still tight.
          The cloaked figure reaches out his black gloved hands,
          loosening the noose a bit.
          CLOAKED FIGURE.
          Now shut the fuck up.
          He turns, sitting back down in front of the monitors.
          EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The latest key. A small key. Like for a locker.
          Eric and Hoffman both crouch under an awning, protected from
          the rain. They study the key.

                         ERIC
          What is it?

                         HOFFMAN
          Looks like a door key.

                         ERIC
          To where?

                         HOFFMAN
          Someplace old. Downtown maybe.
          A POLICE SIREN rises in the distance, taking their attention.
          After a beat, a POLICE CAR flies past the alleyway and further
          down the block. No harm to them.
          Eric's eyes return to the key.
          Rain falls from broken overhead gutter, coming down in a
          heavy splatter. Eric looks to the water, his eyes fluttering.

                         ERIC
          No. I remember it.

                         (BEAT)
          The smell.
          Eric's eyes twitch, taking us back to...
          73.
          INT. FISH PACKING PLANT -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric's in a walk-in cooler formally used for holding fresh
          fish. He's still strapped to a gurney. His eyes fluttering.
          Barely conscious.
          Jigsaw's standing over him.

                         JIGSAW
          I need to deal with one of your
          friends who's gotten a little too
          smart for her own good.
          Eric can't respond, but he stares right at Jigsaw.

                         JIGSAW (CONT'D)
          You'll be safe here in the meantime.
          Jigsaw smirks to Eric, moving to the door and turning before
          he exits.

                         JIGSAW (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, Eric. I'm not going to
          let what happened to me, happen to
          you.
          The door is slammed shut--
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          They're walking now. Fast. The direction dictated. They
          keep their heads low, their voiced careful.

                         ERIC
          It was near the water. I could smell
          the fish.

                         HOFFMAN
          The wharf.
          Hoffman nods, looking back over his shoulder for anyone
          following them.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Who is it? Who's doing this?

                         ERIC
          I-I don't know...

                         HOFFMAN
          Before me, there were traps?
          74.

                         ERIC
          Two.

                         HOFFMAN
          There were people in them?
          A nod.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Who?

                         ERIC
          I don't know.
          Eric tries to think, then he remembers the WALLET, pulling
          it out. He reads the name on the driver's license.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Ivan Smith. That was his apartment
          back there. Something about drugs...
          and listening...to the mentally ill.
          Hoffman looks to the driver's license. He tilt his head.

                         HOFFMAN
          Psychiatrist. Three years ago.
          Dealing meds. Remember?
          Eric's eyes flutter. He does.

                         ERIC
          Yeah, yeah. He got off. Busted for
          trafficking two months later.

                         HOFFMAN
          Lost his license.

                         (BEAT)
          What about the other person?

                         ERIC

                         (THINKING)
          Uh, a peddler... prescriptions or
          something.

                         HOFFMAN
          A doctor?

                         ERIC
          No, no...
          INT. ERIC'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          Bernard sits in the chair with his mouth wide open. He
          squirms as Eric is about to pluck out the key.
          75.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          Eric places him.

                         ERIC
          A pharmacist. Insurance scam. Robbed
          his own store, collecting on the
          insurance, and then resold the stolen
          meds on the street.

                         HOFFMAN
          So their connection is you?
          Eric thinks, and then it hits him like a ton of bricks.
          EXT. LAW FIRM -- LATE DAY (FLASHBACK)
          Eric turns to reenter the school when a MAN bursts through
          the doors and BUMPS RIGHT INTO HIM.
          Eric nearly falls over, and the man keeps going.
          Everything slows in this moment. And the man briefly looks
          back. Eric makes eye contact. The man has dark hair.
          Scraggly black facial hair.
          But it's his eyes. He knows his eyes.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric stops, his eyes wide.

                         ERIC
          I know him.
          INT. POLICE STATION -- BULLPEN -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          Eric. Younger. Healthier. He stands near Kerry. Hoffman's
          in the background at a desk.
          They stare through some glass into an interview room.

                         ERIC
          Does Tapp have this guy or what?

                         KERRY
          I don't know, doesn't exactly fit
          the profile. But he doesn't have an
          alibi.
          FROM ERIC'S P.O.V. : DR. GORDON stands with his back to Eric.
          Dr. Gordon's lawyer, BRETT, talks with his client.
          76.
          INT. POLICE STATION -- INTERVIEW ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Brett sits. His face looking familiar now.

                         BRETT
          As your lawyer and not as your friend,
          my advice is to bite the bullet and
          give them your alibi now - because
          no one is going to believe you later.
          Go for a truthful defense and wrap
          this up.
          Brett's eyes lower, gazing outside the room.
          INT. POLICE STATION -- BULLPEN (FLASHBACK)
          Eric's world slows as his eyes meet with Brett's.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric has slowed to a stop, remembering.

                         ERIC

                         (A WHISPER)
          The lawyer.
          EXT. LAW FIRM -- LATE DAY (FLASHBACK)
          In SLOW MOTION, the man looks right to Eric.

                         MAN
          Watch it.
          Same eyes. The same person. BRETT.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric looks to Hoffman.

                         ERIC
          Lawrence Gordon's lawyer. Ivan
          Smith's lawyer. Bernard Sloan's
          lawyer. Brett Conroy . Lawyer to
          the rich.

                         HOFFMAN
          Brett Conroy ? We set him up.
          77.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          A BLACK CONVERTIBLE PORSCHE 911 sits on the curb with three
          POLICE CRUISERS surrounding it. Their red and blue lights
          flashing.
          Brett, looking drunk, is escorted in handcuffs from the
          Porsche back to a police cruiser.
          Eric passes him, their eyes connecting for a second.
          EXT. PORSCHE 911 -- MOMENTS LATER (FLASHBACK)
          Eric digs in the trunk, pulling out a LARGE BAGGY OF COCAINE.
          He spins, looking back at the other cops, Hoffman being one
          of them.
          A smirk crosses Eric's face.
          FROM ERIC'S P.O.V. : Brett glares at him from the back seat
          of the police cruiser.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Hoffman stares at Eric.

                         HOFFMAN
          Did six months and got disbarred.
          Last I ever heard of him.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          Jigsaw and Eric are nose to nose.

                         JIGSAW
          You know who you are - you're the
          type of person who guns down unarmed
          suspects. The type of person to
          plant evidence to get a conviction.
          The type of person whose wife leaves
          him and son hates him.
          Eric shoots out of his chair, grabs Jigsaw by the throat,
          and cocks his fist back to him...
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric now understands who and why.

                         ERIC
          This is personal.
          78.
          Hoffman takes it in.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          There was someone else at the wharf.

                         HOFFMAN
          Who?
          INT. FISH PACKING PLANT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric props up his head, looking to John as he leaves. There's
          someone just past John. Looking in at him.
          BRETT.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric looks to Hoffman.

                         ERIC
          Him. It's him. It's how Jigsaw got
          his information. Brett was inside.
          Access to the files. Everything.

                         HOFFMAN
          We're gonna need help at the wharf.

                         ERIC
          No, I can't risk them slowing us
          down.

                         HOFFMAN
          They won't. I guarantee you. I'll
          corroborate everything and put myself
          between them and you if need be.
          Eric isn't so sure.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Come on, Eric. We need the help.
          Eric nods, handing over his CELL PHONE as the two quickly
          continue to the wharf.
          Hoffman coughs and stutters steps. He takes his hand from
          his mouth and it's PEPPERED WITH BLOOD.
          Eric sees it.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          I'll be fine. Let's just go.
          Eric nods, unsure. But he can't do anything but continue.
          79.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- IVAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          Ivan's apartment. Now flowing with police and forensics.
          But because of the trap nature, they're all being extra
          careful, trying to de-rig the trip wire along the floor.

                         STRAUM

                         (TO ROOM)
          Extra careful, everyone. Most of
          these traps are still live.
          Perez is already examining the bed frame trap.

                         PEREZ
          Matthews pulls the fire alarm, drawing
          us here, so what's he want us to
          see?

                         STRAUM
          No dead body.

                         PEREZ
          So he's not the killer. Mounted
          camera, so he's being watched. Jigsaw
          tape still intact, so Matthews knows
          the victim. What else?

                         STRAUM
          The trap.
          They both look.
          But what they don't see, we do. A FEMALE FORENSICS worker
          is kneeling near the bed.
          She's reaching for something, and her shift cuff jiggles the
          still live trip wire.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)

                         (RE: TRAP)
          It's the second trap Jigsaw created.
          The mouth device. The head crusher.
          The guillotine. They're winding
          down backwards in chronological order
          to the first trap he created.

                         PEREZ
          Which is?

                         STRAUM
          Woman in a noose standing on a block
          of ice.
          A revelation.
          80.

                         PEREZ
          Who's the woman?

                         STRAUM
          Detective Matthews's wife.

                         PEREZ
          And the accomplice?

                         STRAUM
          Someone Jigsaw trusted.

                         PEREZ
          Like a friend.

                         STRAUM
          Or a business partner.
          CLOSE ON : The Female Forensic worker's cuff SNAGS the trip
          wire as she retracts her hand and--

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          So the grieving wife knows more than
          she's letting on.
          Perez stands right as a swinging ax head from the ceiling

                         GIVES WAY--
          FROM AX HEAD'S P.O.V. : Attached to a metal wire, the AX HEAD
          swings down going right for Perez's face, but Straum pulls
          her back, and the ax head hits--
          THWACK! The Female Forensic Worker right between the eyes,
          SPLATTERING BLOOD five feet in all directions.
          The room GASPS as the woman falls back, DEAD instantly.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Get the goddamn paramedics! Now!
          Now! Now!
          Other officers converge on the accident, and Perez stands
          stunned, Straum having just saved her life.
          EXT. BRICK BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER
          The PARAMEDICS charge into the building with gurney in tow.
          Straum leads Perez out, her eyes drifting to the gurney that
          could have been hers.
          Straum isn't stopping to reflect. He doesn't have time.

                         STRAUM
          Drive!
          81.
          He tosses the keys to the unmarked car to Perez.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Rigg! Round it up!
          In the distance, Rigg perks his head up.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Two teams of three! Now!
          Rigg nods, leading his tattered men to their vehicle.
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          The cloaked figure sits before the monitors.
          Gloria whines, her feet freezing. The noose tightening.
          The cloaked figure turns, and we see that it is indeed BRETT.
          Scraggly facial hair.
          He looks to Gloria and then to the digital clock that reads,
          23:14 and dropping.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          The UNMARKED FBI CAR leads the way, followed by a SWAT TRUCK
          and TWO POLICE CRUISERS.
          Their sirens wail. Lights flashing.
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          Perez drives, running something in her mind. Straum's next
          to her, watching the road.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The FBI car charges through an intersection, forcing
          pedestrian cars to stop.
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          Perez looks over.

                         PEREZ
          Where's the home base?

                         STRAUM
          What?

                         PEREZ
          The lair. Where's the lair?
          82.

                         STRAUM
          Raided. Doesn't exist.

                         PEREZ
          The little girl was freed, Jigsaw
          wanted us to find that place.

                         STRAUM
          So what?

                         PEREZ
          So where's the new game being played
          from?
          INT. CAR -- NIGHT
          FROM BINOCULAR P.O.V : Straum and Perez's Federal car rounds
          a corner.
          The binoculars are lowered, revealing the hands and black
          cloak of the UNSEEN MAN. His hands quiver as he raises a
          CELL PHONE. Dials a number--
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          Perez frequently looks between the road and Straum.

                         STRAUM
          Abandoned building. Sewer. You
          name it.

                         PEREZ
          Yeah, but where?

                         STRAUM
          Downtown. Fits the pattern.

                         PEREZ
          Jigsaw created patterns to break
          them.
          Perez offers Straum a disapproving glance.

                         PEREZ (CONT'D)
          Hand me the map in the back.
          Straum turns, reaching into the back. But he stops.
          Something catching his eye.
          It's the DOLL. A GLASS JAR filled with RED PAINT and NAILS
          connected to a crude CELL PHONE TIMER DEVICE sits in the
          doll's lap.
          83.

                         GET DOWN--
          Straum tries to stomp on brake and pull down Perez's head,

                         BUT--
          BLAM! The jar EXPLODES in a wave of NAILS and RED PAINT
          blowing out all the windows--
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The FBI car swerves, crossing an intersection and into the
          oncoming lane when--
          INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          An OLDER WOMAN sees the FBI car swerving and coming right
          for her. She slams on her brakes but--
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The Older Woman's car smashes and spins the FBI car, causing
          the FBI car to roll to a stop on the curb.
          The SWAT truck and two police cruisers slam on their brakes,
          swerving to avoid the crash.
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          The interior is doused in red paint. SMOKE fills the cabin.
          The back of the seats are torched and shredded to shit.
          A mixture of blood and red paint covers Straum's forehead.
          Perez's bloodied head leans against the dashboard.

                         STRAUM
          Perez...
          Straum grabs her, pulling her back. She gasps.

                         PEREZ
          Ahh...
          She's alive, her eyes fluttering open.
          Straum kicks open his door and tries to pull out Perez, but
          her leg is stuck underneath the dashboard.
          84.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The officers and SWAT members barrel out of their vehicles,
          running to the aid of the crash victims.
          Rigg pulls out the Older Woman who accidentally hit the FBI
          car right as--
          A FLAME rises from underneath the car hood and--
          KA-BLOOM! The car's gas tank EXPLODES, sending an orange
          bal of flame into the air.
          The people on the scene all jump back, protecting themselves.
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          Straum instinctually puts his body over Perez's head,
          protecting her from any debris.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The flames shoot out from the car, igniting spilled gasoline
          on the pavement...
          WHOOSH! The flame streaks ACROSS THE PAVEMENT...
          Rigg has his body over the Older Woman, but he SEES the fire
          heading towards THE SOURCE OF THE GASOLINE...
          THE SMASHED UP FBI CAR...

                         RIGG
          (to Straum and Perez)
          Get out of there!!!
          INT. FBI CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          Straum's eyes bug. He sees it. An instant to react. He
          YANKS on Perez with all his might...

          The flame shoots across the pavement and up into the FBI car
          gas tank...

          Come on!!!
          85.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          Straum yanks out Perez right as--
          KA-BLOOM! The gas tank on the FBI car EXPLODES, flipping
          over the car and sending a plume of smoke and fire into the
          air.
          Straum keeps his body over Perez as the DEBRIS rains down on
          top of them.
          It's chaos.
          The officers and SWAT members pull Straum and Perez further
          away from the flames.
          OTHER CARS have lined up at this point.
          Officials SCREAM into their walkie-talkies for backup.
          Straum rolls back, looking to Perez. She's in bad shape,
          but she's alive.

                         PEREZ
          The wife knows.

                         STRAUM
          What?

                         PEREZ
          She knows. Don't let the accomplice
          get away. Go. Go.

                         STRAUM
          I'm not going to leave you...

                         PEREZ
          You're on the list, not me. Go, or
          more will die.
          (nodding to Rigg and

                         OTHERS)
          Take them. Find the accomplice.
          Finish the game.
          Straum leans back. The world spins. Perez is about to faint.

                         STRAUM
          I need help, here! Move it!
          Straum rises as two uniform cops assist in helping Perez.
          Straum locks eyes with Rigg.
          They're both beaten. Tired. But still poised.
          86.

                         RIGG
          On your command, sir.
          INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
          The familiar hand of the Unseen Man sits on the steering
          wheel. In the distance, the chaotic crash scene unfolds.
          After a beat, the Unseen Man checks his digital watch.
          He sighs in pain, checking his collar device in the rear
          view mirror. Again, his face remains a mystery.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          The Unseen Man's car pulls away from the curb, does a U-turn ,
          and heads back towards the buildings of downtown.
          EXT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- MOMENTS LATER
          The SWAT truck and a police cruiser screech to a stop in
          front of the modest home.
          Straum's the first one out, having been driving the police
          cruiser alone.
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- MOMENTS LATER
          Straum pushes through the doorway, not even allowing Jill to
          get out of her chair. He grabs a framed newspaper clipping
          off the mantle and gets right in Jill's face.

                         STRAUM
          I want to know the whole fucking
          story. And I want to know about
          this guy.
          CLOSE ON : A newspaper photo of John and Brett shaking hands
          in front of a building in the background. The caption reads,
          "CREATING A BETTER LIFE ONE BUILDING AT A TIME."
          Jill's eyes strain as her mouth goes agape.

                         JILL
          I already told you--

                         STRAUM
          You didn't tell me shit. You got
          bitched up and quiet. You're gonna
          talk. You're gonna tell us everything
          or an entire precinct will pull it
          from your fucking throat!
          Straum's tone takes Jill aback, she tries to get up out of
          the chair, but he shoves her back down.
          87.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Right now!!!
          Straum kneels, getting right in her face.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Everything about John Kramer .
          Jill looks to Rigg and the SWAT team. They're not helping.
          Straum SLAPS Jill.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)
          Talk!
          Rigg and his men turn away, taking a step from the room.

                         JILL

                         YOU MOTHERFUCKER--
          Straum slaps her again.

                         STRAUM
          Talk!!!
          Jill's jarred back into looking at Straum. He's about to
          blow. Her face is red. Her eyes wide.
          Straum's got her. And he's not letting her go. Slowly,
          Jill calms herself, and her mouth opens to talk...
          EXT. PARK -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          It's a sunny day. John records Jill with the video camera.

                         JOHN
          I love you.

                         JILL
          I love you.
          They kiss.
          Then, John's hand lowers, TOUCHING JILL'S STOMACH. It's not
          protruding, but she's certainly PREGNANT.
          Jill's gaze wanders. John notices.
          They both turn, seeing OBI. Strung out. Twitchy. Going
          through a trash can. Looking for a meal.

                         JOHN
          Today's for us.
          88.

                         JILL
          It breaks my heart.
          John knows he can't stop Jill. He nods, kissing her.
          Jill leaves their embrace, moving to help Obi.
          INT. JILL'S CLINIC -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          Jill, now really showing, moves through the overcrowded

          As is ADDISON (Saw 2 house). LAURA (Saw 2 house). PAUL
          (Saw 1 razor room). And MARK (Saw 1 glass room).
          Jill's doing her usual work of keeping the doctors and nurses
          happy and moving along the patients who have been waiting
          for up to four hours.
          Then, a FIGHT BREAKS OUT in the waiting area.
          Jill's the first to jump into the fray, trying to break up
          the TWO BATTLE MEN.
          WHAM! She's pushed, back FALLING into her side, hitting her
          PREGNANT BELLY hard on the floor.
          INT. JOHN'S OFFICE -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          A posh ENGINEERING OFFICE in a high-rise. A group of well-

          John's amongst them. He turns, answering his cell phone.
          His smile drops the instant the person on the other end starts
          talking.
          INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          John storms into the sterile white emergency room and steps
          to the front of the line at the nurses station.

                         JOHN
          My wife... my wife was brought in

          Sir, you're going to have to--
          John moves past the station, and into the ER.

          John enters. A NURSE IN SCRUBS moves to stop him.

          What's going on?! What are you doing
          to my wife?!

                         NURSE
          Sir, you can't come in here--
          John's eyes shoot to the operating table. TWO DOCTORS in
          scrubs and masks operate on Jill.

                         JOHN
          Is the baby hurt?!
          TWO SECURITY GUARDS from outside enter, pulling out John.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          What's going on! Talk to me! Someone
          talk to me!
          John's yanked out kicking and screaming.
          INT. HOSPITAL -- HALLWAY -- LATER (FLASHBACK)
          John stands looking in through a window. His eyes are puffy
          from crying. He has zero expression.
          FROM JOHN'S P.O.V. : His baby. Months premature. Hooked up
          to tubes. Struggling for life.
          INT. HOSPITAL -- ROOM -- LATER (FLASHBACK)
          John enters a dark room with a lone bed in the middle. Jill's
          there, sleeping. She too has tubes sticking out of her.
          John's head lowers, and he moves to a chair opposite her,
          sitting. John eyes rise to his unconscious wife.
          Then, his head drops into his hands. The tears come. And
          he cries.

          It was never the same after that.
          90.
          INT. JOHN'S HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY (FLASHBACK)
          John sits in a chair, watching TV. He has the expression of
          a comatose patient in a mental ward
          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          I'm sorry...
          John's eyes shift. On the couch, leaning forward is Brett.

                         BRETT
          But we need to talk about the
          properties...

                         JOHN
          Do what you want with them.
          John's gaze returns to the TV.
          Brett sighs. He rises, crossing the room and moving to the
          kitchen.
          INT. JOHN'S HOME -- KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
          Jill's at the table. She has a cup of tea in front of her,
          and she's doing the same thing as John, staring into oblivion.
          Brett sits next to her.

                         BRETT
          You doing alright, beautiful?
          Jill's gaze rises. Brett's genuine smile makes her smile
          just a bit.
          INT. JOHN'S HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
          John turns to the kitchen.

          John gets up slowly. He follows a nurse into an office and
          she closes the door.
          The words stenciled on the door read, "DR. LAWRENCE GORDON -
          ONCOLOGY."
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- DAY

                         PRESENT
          Jill lowers her head, shaken.

                         JILL
          That was the last time I ever saw
          him.
          EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING (FLASHBACK)
          A cold autumn day. Grey skies. A stiff wind.
          John, his torso wrapped and his arm in a sling from his car
          accident, stares at the ground. At his DEAD CHILD'S GRAVE.
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Straum sits back, rising and giving Jill her space.

                         STRAUM
          What was your child's name?

                         JILL
          Gideon .
          Straum nods, sitting down on the couch next to Jill. He
          moves close.

                         STRAUM
          Brett. He was John's business
          partner. And his best friend.
          Jill replies, but--
          RING-RING-RING! Our attention is taken away from the
          conversation.
          Rigg turn, answering his cell phone.
          92.

                         RIGG

                         (INTO PHONE)
          This is Rigg.
          His head nods. And the turns.

                         RIGG (CONT'D)
          Matthews called in. We're tracking
          his cell.
          Straum looks over in mid-conversation.

                         STRAUM
          Alright.
          Straum wraps it up with Jill as Rigg and his men exit.

                         STRAUM (CONT'D)

                         (TO JILL)
          I'm sorry.
          She nods. And he exits.
          EXT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- MOMENTS LATER
          Straum comes down the stairs, moving to his police cruiser.

                         STRAUM
          Where to?

                         RIGG
          Follow us, he's on the move.
          Rigg turns, but then he turns back

                         RIGG (CONT'D)
          Hey. The guy in the first place.
          Jigsaw piece taken from his thigh.
          Straum nods, diving into his car.
          INT. POLICE CRUISER -- CONTINUOUS
          Straum fires up the engine. The SWAT truck in front of him
          PEELS OUT from the curb.
          Straum follows but then slams on the brakes.
          His eyes widen. He's running something in his head. And

                         THEN--
          EXT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- CONTINUOUS
          The SWAT truck is gone up the block. Straum exits his car
          and runs back into John's old home.
          93.
          INT. JOHN'S OLD HOME -- CONTINUOUS
          Straum enters. Jill turns to him.

                         STRAUM
          What was your child's name again?

                         JILL
          Gideon . Why?
          Straum grabs the framed newspaper photo of John and Brett
          shaking in front of a decaying building.

                         STRAUM
          Where is this building?
          CLOSE ON : In the background, on the building, in faded paint,
          a sign reads, " GIDEON - FISH PROCESSING."
          EXT. NEW LAIR -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The key sinks into the lock, turning.
          The door opens. Eric looks to Hoffman. Hoffman is now PALE.
          His eyes DARKENED. He nods to enter, their handguns leading
          the way.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- ENTRYWAY -- CONTINUOUS
          It's a thin hallway with cobweb-covered ceilings. RATS and
          PIGEONS scurry about, startled by the intruders.
          The rain knocks against the tin roof.

                         ERIC
          Prop the door.
          Hoffman nods, grabbing a nearby piece of debris, propping
          open the door.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck...
          Eric looks back to Hoffman. Hoffman stands back up, BLOOD
          runs from his nose.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Keep moving.
          Hoffman runs his sleeve over the blood. The two men advance,
          seeing a DIGITAL CLOCK. Completely out of place.
          It's reads, 8:43 and dropping.
          Eric leads the way through a doorway when--
          94.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALL OF HORRORS -- CONTINUOUS
          WHOOSH-WHOOSH-WHOOSH! A series of SPOT LIGHTS turn on one
          after the other.
          There are cages on either side of the hallway. And within
          each cage, highlighted by a spotlight, are the traps of
          Jigsaw's past.
          Some are familiar (reverse bear trap, Venus fly trap, the
          rack) while others have yet to be seen in action.

                         HOFFMAN
          You trip something?

                         ERIC
          No.
          Eric sees a remote MOTION SENSOR on the far wall.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Somebody's got a few new toys.
          There's another DIGITAL CLOCK. It reads, 7:15 and dropping.
          At the end of the hallway, there's another door.
          Eric leads the way to the door at the end of the hallway,
          He's able to kick it open...
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          The SWAT truck drives through an empty intersection. Lights
          swirling. Siren blaring.
          The engine revs.
          INT. SWAT TRUCK -- REAR CABIN -- NIGHT
          Rigg is in the back with several other members. He's checking
          his weapon.

                         RIGG
          ETA?
          A SWAT MEMBER opposite him has a LAPTOP.

                         SWAT MEMEBER 1
          Three minutes. I got 'em centralized
          to half a block radius. Signal's
          focusing.
          CLOSE ON : The laptop. It's a grid of the city. There's a
          blinking dot. Eric's cell phone.
          95.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Back with Eric and Hoffman stepping into the room.
          It's HUGE. Something once used to process tons of fish a
          day. No windows. High ceilings. Cement floors.
          It's completely bare.
          And pitch dark. Besides the SPOTLIGHT from above, Eric can't
          see a thing.

                         ERIC
          Shit.
          Hoffman stumbles a bit, coughs. Eric looks back to him.
          Hoffman shakes his head.
          The two men step through the light on the floor, and the
          second they step into the darkness, a NEW SPOTLIGHT turns
          on, and the previous one turns off.
          They're being tracked.

                         HOFFMAN

                         (MOTIONING)
          Look.
          On the far wall, there's a red light. It's a DIGITAL CLOCK.
          Now reading, 5:58 and dropping.
          Eric and Hoffman move. And with every few steps, the
          spotlight changes.
          The digital clock is on the top of a door. It's no ordinary
          door. It's like a GIANT WALK-IN SAFE DOOR.
          No way they can break it. Not without a few hundred pounds
          of TNT.
          There's a ROLL DIAL. Four numbers. Zero through nine.
          Could be any combination. And it's the only way through the
          door.

                         ERIC
          A combination.

                         HOFFMAN
          Four numbers. Anything?
          Eric tries to think, shaking his head.

                         ERIC
          I-I don't know--
          96.
          WHOOSH! Another spotlight turns on. This one in the middle
          of the room.
          It's a TABLE.
          Eric and Hoffman look to each other and move to it.
          This time, the spotlights don't follow them.
          Only two stay on. One on the table. And one on the
          combination door.
          Hoffman gets to the table first. There's a MICRO-CASSETTE
          RECORDER in the middle of the table.
          Eric's eyes strain.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Play it.
          Hoffman's hand trembles, he spits a bit of blood.

                         HOFFMAN
          Fuck...
          Hoffman picks up the recorder, hitting play.
          Tape hiss, and then the distorted voice comes on.
          Jigsaw.
          JIGSAW (V.O.)

                         (FROM TAPE)
          Hello, Detective Matthews . If you've
          come this far then you're one step
          closer to completing your test.

                         (BEAT)
          But now's the most difficult test of
          all. In our time together, I didn't
          only give you back your life, I also
          gave you the tools to continue living.
          You've carried these tools around
          with you, unaware that they were
          ever there. Now's the time they
          will come into use.

                         (BEAT)
          There's a door before you requiring
          a four number combination to pass
          through it. These numbers are a
          part of you now, Detective Matthews .
          And to find them, all you'll have to
          do is use your wisdom and look within.

                         (BEAT)
          And remember, Detective Matthews .

          JIGSAW (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The circle always goes top to bottom,
          right to left.
          Tape hiss returns, and then the tape cuts out.
          Eric looks to the digital clock. It reads, 4:52 and dropping.

                         HOFFMAN
          Look within?
          WHOOSH! A third spotlight turns on. Something on the floor
          is highlighted.
          Hoffman takes a step forward, seeing it first. His eyes
          bulge. He looks to Eric.
          Eric winces.
          CLOSE ON : The highlighted item is a pair of DENTAL PLIERS.

                         HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
          Jesus.
          Eric shutters, as if already feeling the pain.
          INT. FISH PROCESSING PLANT -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric's on his back. Barely conscious. A MASKED JIGSAW stands
          over him, holding a DENTAL DRILL.
          Eric's head turns, seeing another person in mask over his
          shoulder.
          The drill FIRES UP, coming down into his mouth.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric unconsciously rubs his jaw.

                         ERIC
          My wisdom teeth... the numbers are
          on them.
          Eric turns to the digital clock that reads, 4:15 and dropping.
          He moves to the dental pliers, picking them up.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Fuck...

                         HOFFMAN
          Do you want me to--
          98.
          Eric shakes his head.

                         ERIC
          Top to bottom, right to left.
          Eric puts the pliers into his mouth, finding his top right
          WISDOM TOOTH.
          Hoffman winces, looking away.
          Eric clamps the pliers.
          He holds his breath.
          Then, he PULLS--
          The pain is excruciating. His face tenses up. He pulls
          with all his might, twisting and--
          The tooth comes out, blood flowing out like a river.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Oh, god...
          Eric gasps, dropping to his knees and spitting up blood.
          Hoffman moves in, taking the tooth and looking to it.
          CLOSE ON : There's a number on the root reading, "5."
          Eric yells, trying to get out all the pain. But it's only
          going to get worse.
          He eyes the digital clock. It reads, 3:37 and dropping.
          Eric readjusts the pliers, gagging on the flowing blood.
          He kneels, getting it in place on his lower right WISDOM
          TOOTH.
          Eric takes a breath, clamps the tooth, and--
          YANKS AND TWISTS...
          This one comes faster, but the blood is even worse, causing
          Eric to fall over, spitting up a mouthful of blood and saliva.
          He falls to his knees, screaming with pain.

                         HOFFMAN
          Three and a half minutes...
          Hoffman moves in, picking up the second tooth.
          CLOSE ON : The tooth reads, "1."
          99.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Brett's up. He's pacing. Watching the monitors and holding
          the handgun.
          Gloria's gagging now. The noose tight around her neck.
          She's crying, gasping for air.

                         GLORIA
          Sonuvabitch ... sonuvabitch ...
          Brett, incensed, moves to Gloria, getting in her face.

                         BRETT
          He ruined my life, why shouldn't I
          just kill you now?
          Brett raises the handgun, putting it to her head.

                         BRETT (CONT'D)
          Huh?!
          Gloria cries, closing her eyes. Brett's finger tightens on
          the trigger, but he stops, looking to the digital clock that
          reads, 2:58 and dropping.
          Brett steps away.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT
          The SWAT truck comes to a stop. The men barrel out.
          EXT. CITY STREET -- CONTINUOUS
          Rigg leads the group, looking to the building. It's an old
          building of neoclassic design.
          The sign out front reads, "CITY MORGUE."

                         RIGG
          This some kind of sick joke?
          SWAT Member 1 shakes his head, eyeing his laptop.

          Basement. Currently immobile.
          EXT. FISH PROCESSING PLANT -- NIGHT
          Straum's car comes to a halt. The rain comes down in buckets
          at this point.
          He hops out, his eyes rising to the front entryway with faded
          sign that reads, " GIDEON - FISH PROCESSING."
          100.
          Straum pulls his handgun and advances.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Eric rises to his feet. Blood flows from his mouth. His
          face pale. He could pass out at any moment.
          But he's only halfway there.
          The digital clock reads, 2:38 and dropping.
          Eric screams, working up his pain tolerance.
          He puts the dental pliers into his mouth again. Finds the
          bottom left WISDOM TOOTH. Clamps down.
          Eric takes three quick breaths and then--
          YANKS AND TWISTS...
          But this one doesn't come as easily. He's nearly crying as
          he twists and twists...
          It finally pops out.
          Eric loosens his grip on the pliers, the tooth bouncing on
          the floor.
          Hoffman moves to it, picking it up.

                         HOFFMAN
          One more, buddy. One more.
          Hoffman eyes the tooth. He gags.
          CLOSE ON : The tooth number reads, "5."
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
          Rigg leads the other SWAT Team members through the basement
          hallway. It's the same hallway Eric came up in the beginning.
          But they don't enter the examination room, they keep going,
          down the hallway, following the BLINKING LIGHT on the laptop.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT
          Straum enters through the propped open door and into the
          thin hallway.
          He keeps his handgun up, pointing it to any rat or pigeon
          that makes a sound.
          101.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Eric's screaming, shaking his head. The pain overtakes his
          body.
          Everything's running through his head.
          It's all coming at him like a ten foot wave of emotion.
          Hoffman's at the door, putting in the first three numbers.
          They read, 5-1-5.
          One more.
          The digital clock reads, 1:28 and dropping.

                         HOFFMAN
          Come on, buddy... she's here.
          Gloria's here.
          Eric cries out, trying to control himself.
          His eyes look to the digital clock. Gotta go.
          Last one.
          Eric takes a series of deep breaths.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          The digital clock reads, 1:00 and dropping.
          Brett cocks the handgun, pacing and looking between the
          monitor and Gloria.
          Gloria's face is red. She's wheezing, barely able to muster
          the slightest breath.

                         BRETT
          He's not going to make it.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Eric puts the dental pliers into his mouth, finding the top
          left WISDOM TOOTH, clamping down on it.
          With a scream, he YANKS AND TWISTS THE TOOTH...
          It pops out, causing Eric to scream, looking up to the
          ceiling.
          His arms out, screaming a deep, GUTTURAL SCREAM.
          Eric lumbers to his feet.
          102.
          He moves to the door, looking to the tooth still clamped
          into the dental pliers.
          CLOSE ON : The combination reads, 5-1-5-0.

                         ERIC
          It's fucking police code...
          Hoffman spits bright red into his hands.

                         HOFFMAN
          For an escaped mental patient.
          Eric pulls the handle, opening the door.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALL OF HORRORS -- NIGHT
          Straum moving quickly through the hallway. His eyes look to
          the many classic traps, but he keeps his focus forward.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- BODY STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT
          Rigg and the SWAT Team members move down the long, thin
          hallway with stark white lighting when--
          There's a SOUND.
          It's faint. But it's consistent.
          Rigg stops the men. They all look around. What is it?
          They creep further down the hallway and the sounds becomes
          more clear as a--
          RING-RING-RING! Cell phone. Muted, but definitely a cell
          phone.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
          Eric and Hoffman shamble down the hallway coming to a fork
          in the road.
          There's a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall that reads, :24 and
          dropping.
          Below the clock, there's a message written in red paint that
          reads, "LOOK CLOSER, DETECTIVE MATTHEWS ."
          Under that, there are LETTERS lit up like as if projected
          from a light source.
          The letters spell out, "EVIL." And there's an ARROW under
          the word pointing to the RIGHT.
          Eric moves down the RIGHT CORRIDOR.
          103.
          The digital clock reads, :18 and dropping.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- BODY STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT
          RING-RING-RING! The sound is getting closer and closer.
          Rigg moves forward, taking them into the room with the wall
          of METALLIC PULLOUT DRAWERS.
          The sound is coming from within one of the drawers. SWAT
          Member 1 whistles, pointing to a drawer.
          Rigg moves forward.
          They aim their weapons, and the drawer is opened, revealing
          an EMPTY PULLOUT DRAWER and a RINGING PHONE.
          Rigg looks to the name plate.
          CLOSE ON : The name plate reads, "JOHN KRAMER ."
          THE BODY IS GONE.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The digital clock reads, :09 and dropping.
          Brett raises the handgun to Gloria's chest.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
          Eric sprints down the hallway. Hoffman coughs, stumbling
          and falling to a knee.
          Eric looks back, but Hoffman waves him on.

                         HOFFMAN
          Go... go... go...
          The hallway is lined with DIGITAL CLOCKS.
          Seven... six... five...
          There's a sliding door halfway open at the end of the hallway.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Straum moves through the combination room, seeing the dental
          pliers. The stains of blood. The open combination door.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Brett has his eyes on the digital clock...
          Three... two... one...
          104.
          He turns to fire and--
          ERIC (O.S.)
          No!!!
          Eric screams, barreling into the room.
          BLAM! Brett puts a bullet in Gloria's chest, causing her
          feet to give way and the noose to tighten fully around her
          neck.
          Eric raises his handgun and fires bullets all over the room.
          Brett dodges the best he can but-
          BLAM! Puts a bullet in Brett's chest, causing him to drop
          his handgun and crumble to the floor.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- COMBINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
          Straum heard that. He runs for the combination door, passing
          through it.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Eric pulls down Gloria from the noose, loosening the rope
          from around her neck.

                         ERIC
          No... no... no...
          Gloria gags up blood, her lungs unable to get air.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
          Straum comes to the fork in the road. He looks to the signs
          on the walls.
          He's about to go right, but then he notices something.
          The wall is a MIRROR.
          And on the wall opposite, the same letters that spelled "EVIL"
          now spell " LIVE."
          And the arrow's pointing down the LEFT HALLWAY .
          Straum goes left.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Eric holds Gloria. She gasps for air.

                         ERIC
          No... hold on... hold on...
          105.
          It's a losing battle. Gloria gags on blood.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          Hold on... hold on...
          Tears flow down Eric's face. Emotional overload.
          Gloria's life slipping away.
          With one last gag, Gloria's eyes go wide, and her body goes
          slack.

                         ERIC (CONT'D)
          No... no... no...
          Eric's head spins.
          Then, Brett stirs. He's not dead.

                         BRETT
          Do it! Do it! Do it!
          The rage rushes back into Eric. He sets down his wife and
          moves to kill Brett.
          He extends his handgun and--

                         BRETT (CONT'D)
          No!!! Stop!!! Stop!!!
          Eric stands right over him, aiming his handgun right at
          Brett's head.

                         BRETT (CONT'D)
          Stop!!!
          Brett holds up his hand, showing Eric a MICRO-CASSETTE
          RECORDER.
          Eric freezes. His rage resides for a second. His eyes

                         WIDENING AS--
          Brett presses play and--
          JIGSAW (V.O.)

                         (FROM TAPE)
          Hello Brett. I have a game for you.
          There is a poison in the device
          attached to your forearm. If you
          don't want it to kill you, you had
          better join my game. Now listen
          carefully to the rules...
          Eric's head sways. His hand shakes. Then, he remembers.
          106.

                         ERIC
          You weren't screaming.
          Eric turns to Hoffman standing in the doorway--
          Hoffman already has his handgun out. The handgun given to
          him by Eric.
          BLAM! A bullet rips into Eric's shoulder, causing him to
          drop his handgun and fall back, collapsing onto his butt.
          Eric struggles to get up, but he's paralyzed with shock.
          Betrayal. His eyes staring at Hoffman, no longer showing
          the ill-effects of the nerve agent.
          Eric's mind races, taking him back to...
          A RAPID STROBE OF IMAGES RUNNING THROUGH HIS BRAIN.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Eric takes a step into the room.

                         ERIC
          Does someone want to tell me what
          I'm doing here?
          Eric glances to Hoffman. Hoffman's gentle nod says it all.
          They're good friends.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          The Coroner holds a small WAX BALL.

                         ERIC
          He wants us to find what's inside.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          CLOSE ON : A hand torch fires to life. The Coroner holds the

          Careful, doc.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Straum looks to Eric.

                         STRAUM
          What happened, Detective Matthews ?
          Why'd he spare your life?

          In our time together, you came so
          far, but you didn't fully learn to
          cherish what's so precious in life.
          INT. MOTEL -- ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Eric looks to the mounted camera again.

                         ERIC
          Try to trick me?! Huh, you fuck?!
          Well, I beat you! I beat your fucking
          game!
          INT. JIGSAW'S LAIR -- THE SICK ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Jigsaw leans into Eric, touching Eric's head.

                         JIGSAW
          It's what's up here that needs fixing.
          I just hope we'll have enough time.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- IVAN'S APARTMENT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric sees Hoffman bound to the bed frame.

                         ERIC
          What are you doing here?

                         HOFFMAN
          I'm wondering the same.
          INT. BRICK BUILDING -- IVAN'S APARTMENT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric pulls out the HANDGUN he took from the cop, handing it
          to Hoffman.

                         ERIC
          I need you with me.

                         HOFFMAN
          Yeah. Yeah, of course.
          INT. FISH PROCESSING PLANT (FLASHBACK)
          Jigsaw smirks to Eric, moving to the door and turning before
          he exits.
          108.

                         JIGSAW
          Don't worry, Eric. I'm not going to
          let what happened to me, happen to
          you.
          EXT. CITY STREET (FLASHBACK)
          Hoffman nods, looking back over his shoulder for anyone
          following them.

                         HOFFMAN
          Who is it? Who's doing this?

                         ERIC
          I-I don't know...
          INT. HOFFMAN'S APARTMENT -- (FLASHBACK)
          In the reflection of a HALLWAY MIRROR into an unlit room, a
          PIG MASK WATCHES.
          Hoffman enters frame, grabbing it off a shelf and stuffing
          it into a back pack.
          EXT. CITY STREET (FLASHBACK)
          Hoffman looks to the driver's license. He tilts his head.

                         HOFFMAN
          Psychiatrist. Three years ago.
          Dealing meds. Remember?
          EXT. CITY STREET (FLASHBACK)

                         ERIC
          There was someone else at the wharf.

          Who?
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric lurches back, staring at Hoffman moving closer to him.

                         ERIC
          You...
          INT. FISH PACKING PLANT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric props up his head, looking to John as he leaves. There's
          someone just past John. Looking in at him.
          But it's not Brett.
          109.
          IT'S HOFFMAN.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Eric looks to Hoffman. Hoffman's trying to find a spot where
          his cell works.

                         HOFFMAN
          Reception down here is for shit.
          Eric tosses his CELL PHONE to Hoffman without missing a beat.
          INT. CITY MORGUE -- EXAMINATION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Eric turns, grabbing his cell phone back from Hoffman and
          exiting the office.
          This time, stay on Hoffman, seeing a sly smirk.
          IT'S HOFFMAN.
          EXT. CITY STREET (FLASHBACK)
          Hoffman looks to Eric.

                         HOFFMAN
          We're gonna need help at the wharf.

                         ERIC
          No, I can't risk them slowing us
          down.

                         HOFFMAN
          They won't. I guarantee you.
          Eric nods, handing over his CELL PHONE.
          INT. FISH PROCESSING PLANT (FLASHBACK)
          Eric's on his back. Barely conscious. A MASKED HOFFMAN
          stands over him, holding a DENTAL DRILL.
          Eric's head turns, seeing another person in mask over his
          shoulder.
          This is the FEEBLE JIGSAW .
          Hoffman does the heavy lifting.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Eric barrels into the room to save Gloria.
          Behind him, down the hallway, Hoffman pulls out the ANTIDOTE
          SYRINGE from his arm, dropping it.
          110.
          His eyes rise, and he reaches for his handgun.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM (FLASHBACK)
          Brett screams as Eric bears down on him.

                         BRETT
          Do it! Do it! Do it!
          But he's not talking to Eric. He's looking past Eric at
          Hoffman. He's telling Hoffman to shoot Eric.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT

                         PRESENT
          Eric looks up to Hoffman.

                         ERIC
          You...

                         HOFFMAN
          You still never learned a thing,
          Eric. I'm sorry. We gave you every
          opportunity.

                         ERIC
          Why? Why did you do it?! WHY THE
          FUCK ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

                         HOFFMAN
          I'm just trying to help people.
          There's a beat and then Hoffman points his handgun--
          BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three bullets rip into Eric's chest,
          putting him down for good.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
          Straum comes to a half-opened sliding door, not having heard
          the gunshots.
          He eases into the room...
          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
          It's a small room with a door on the opposite end. A monitor
          sits on a table next to a button that reads, "LIVE."
          CLOSE ON : The monitor shows Gloria, slumped over on the floor.
          Straum moves to the monitor, then looking to the button.
          111.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Hoffman stands there. Different expression. It's poised.
          Earnest. Pure evil.
          Brett still quivers in the corner. Covered in Ned's tissue.

                         BRETT
          I did what you wanted... now get me
          an ambulance... please...
          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- NIGHT
          Straum unknowingly presses the LIVE button--
          SLAM! The door he entered through SLAMS SHUT--
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          CLOSE ON : The syringe in Brett's forearm cast PLUNGES into
          his arm.
          Brett instantly reacts. And the poison is fast, causing him
          to SEIZE UP.
          Hoffman turns, looking to the MOUNTED CAMERA in the room.
          He's under it. Out of the shot.
          Hoffman smirks.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- NIGHT
          Straum tries to pull at the door, but it's not going to open.
          He turns, looking to the DOOR at the opposite side of the
          room.
          Straum moves to it.
          He tries to open the door, but it's LOCKED. Straum reaches
          into his pocket, pulling out the KEY HE TOOK FROM AMANDA.
          Straum plunges the key into the lock and turns when--
          ZZCCCHHHHHH !!!
          A TV in the corner of the room pops onto static. And then,
          an image comes on.
          The doll.

          reaches out for Hoffman, gasping for help.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- NIGHT
          The door opens, casting an AUBURN LIGHT onto Straum's face,

          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- NIGHT
          As Straum's eyes adjust to the light, his brow tightens, not
          believing what he's seeing.
          It's a cabinet. Filled with dozens and dozens of FORMALDEHYDE
          JARS.

                         DOLL

                         (FROM SCREEN)
          Revival starts by simply putting the
          pieces together.
          113.
          And in the formaldehyde jars are the JIGSAW PIECES. Taken
          from each victim. Each a different size and shape.
          INT. CAR -- NIGHT
          The Unseen Man crouches in the back seat of a car. He looks
          to his digital watch.
          The sound of the FRONT CAR DOOR OPENING causes the Unseen
          Man to crouch even more.
          Now, the Unseen Man is revealed. It's NED. One of the
          missing sixteen people.
          Ned reaches into his back pack, pulling out a SYRINGE and
          PIG MASK. Ned takes a quick breath and slides on the pig
          mask.

                         (ON TV)
          And so now, Agent Straum, the end
          begins...
          The man in the front seat adjusts his read view mirror,
          revealing himself as CAPTAIN CHANG.
          INT. NEW LAIR -- LIVE ROOM -- NIGHT
          Straum stares at the Jigsaw pieces, shuttering in wonder.

                         STRAUM
          My god...
          INT. NEW LAIR -- EVIL ROOM -- NIGHT
          Brett makes one last attempt, reaching out his hand and
          SCREAMING.
          Hoffman looks to Brett, silhouetted in the sliding door.

                         HOFFMAN
          Game over.
          He SLAMS the door shut. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
          Brett SCREAMS into the abyss.
