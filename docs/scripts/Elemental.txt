      EXT. OCEAN - DAY

      Through the mist we see a glow. A small weathered boat breaks
      through, traveling toward camera. At first it appears the
      deck is on fire, but as the boat gets closer, we see the
      "fire" is actually two FIRE ELEMENTS, BERNIE and a very
      pregnant CINDER.

      TITLE: DISNEY PRESENTS

      They huddle together surrounded by suitcases and a small
      lantern that holds a BLUE FLAME.

      Bernie opens one of the suitcases, takes out a metallic shawl
      and lovingly wraps it around Cinder. It's been a long, tough
      journey.

      A shadow passes over them and they look up to see a hot air
      balloon soar overhead.

      And then, through the mist, Element City comes into view.

      At last they have arrived!

      It's awe inspiring -- there are skyscrapers covered with
      waterfalls, buildings with trees growing all over them,
      windmills, blimps, balloons, partially-submerged water boats
      and other vessels all make their way to the shore.


      EXT. GRAND GATEWAY DOCKS - DAY

      Bernie and Cinder step off the boat onto the dock and walk
      toward the main processing center (think of this like an
      otherworldly Ellis Island).

      They stare amazed as another boat pulls up, its deck covered
      in what looks like a forest. The gates open and we reveal the
      "forest" was a crowd of Earth Elements with trees growing out
      of their heads.

                            EARTH BOAT ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                  Please keep all limbs and branches
                  inside.

      Next, a submarine rises from the water. The front pops open
      and water gushes out, into a puddle that is littered with
      hats and suitcases. After a beat, Water Elements emerge from
      the puddle and gather their stuff. Two WATER PASSENGERS trade
      briefcases.

                            WATER PASSENGER 2
                  Ohp! I believe this is yours.

                            WATER PASSENGER 1
                  Oh, thanks!

      Bernie and Cinder try to take it all in.

      They look up to see a blimp land on a tall perch. A hatch
      opens and cloud-like Air Elements float out.

      As the passengers exit, the blimp deflates and lowers to the
      perch below, where more Air passengers float on board,
      causing it it puff back up.

      Bernie and Cinder join the crowd of Elements that walk into
      the immigration hall.

      They are the only Fire figures in the entire scene.


      INT. IMMIGRATION HALL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      They enter the massive processing hall, slowly moving through
      the line. They look up to see an EPIC MURAL depicting the
      three waves of Elements that came together to form Element
      City so many years ago. Water was the first to arrive,
      followed by Earth and then Air.

      It's their turn for processing. They hurry over to a
      welcoming WOOD IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL

                            WOOD IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
                  Your names?

                  Great! And how do we spell that?

      Bernie, eager, makes a series of fire sounds. The official's
      smile drops a little, then bright:

                            WOOD IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
                  How `bout we just go with Bernie
                  and Cinder!

      The official presses his nose onto an ink pad and then onto a
      document on the table, leaving an official stamp.

                  Welcome to Element City!

      BIG DOORS OPEN revealing the bustling, busy city outside.


      EXT. ELEMENT CITY - STREET - SHORTLY AFTER

      TITLE: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM

                            HOT LOG VENDOR (O.S.)
                  Hot logs! Hot logs for sale!

      It's like Manhattan at rush hour, crowded with various
      Elements -- we see Earth, Water and Air people moving about
      the city in slides and on boats. Large canals run between the
      city blocks and skyscrapers.

      But still Bernie and Cinder are the only Fire.

      Distracted, Bernie walks right THROUGH an Air Element.

                            AIR ELEMENT
                  Hey! Watch it "Sparky!"

      They spot an ELEVATED TRAIN as it zooms by, sending water
      cascading over the sides of the tracks.


      INT. TRAIN - SHORTLY AFTER

      Bernie and Cinder sit self-consciously in a train car clearly
      designed to accommodate Air, Earth and Water, but NOT Fire.

      The other passengers stand back from them and stare.

      The train LURCHES causing a nearby WATER GUY to stumble,
      splashing WATER on Cinder with a HISS.

      Cinder winces. Her flame shrinks and steams. Bernie quickly
      pulls some wood out of his bag and tenderly feeds it to her,
      repairing her fire. They both look to Cinder's pregnant belly
      -- that was close.

      Bernie then GLARES back at the Water Guy, furious.

                            BERNIE
                  Hmmmm. Water.


      EXT. ELEMENT CITY EARTH/WATER NEIGHBORHOODS

      They exit a train station and eagerly approach an Earth
      brownstone building with a "For Rent" sign in the window.


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                    4.


      An EARTH LANDLORD opens the door, but her eyes widen when she
      sees Bernie and Cinder. She points to her leafy hair:

                            EARTH LANDLORD
                  Dry leaves.

      Then slams the door in their faces.

      At another building, Cinder pushes a doorbell. It catches
      fire -- in a panic she blows it out, then acts casual.

      A WATER LANDLORD opens the door, sees the two of them and
      immediately slams the door.

      A series of more door slams.


      EXT. RUNDOWN NEIGHBORHOOD

      Dejected, Bernie and Cinder find themselves under the
      elevated train tracks, in a rundown, deserted neighborhood.
      They sit down to rest, exhausted, defeated.

      This is not how they hoped things would go.

      Suddenly, Bernie spots something.

      On the other side of a CANAL FILLED WITH WATER is a broken
      down building with a "For Sale" sign. Hope flashes in his
      eyes. He runs to the building.

                            BERNIE
                       (in Firish, excited)
                  Kh� k� sh� sh!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - DAY

      Bernie runs around, excited and full of ideas.

                            BERNIE
                  R� b�� kh�r! Utriksh! T'�� ss
                  ks�r�f!

      Cinder, more skeptical, stands just inside the doorway. Water
      drips from A PIPE and almost hits her. Bernie bounds to her
      side.

                              BERNIE
                  Ha ha!

      He gestures excitedly, laying out his plan.

                  Ks�d�r � B�rd�!

      He continues running around.

                               BERNIE
                  Ha ha!

      SNAP his feet burn through a floorboard. He falls out of
      frame into the basement.

                               BERNIE
                  Ah!!

      His thumb shoots up through the hole:

                               BERNIE
                  I'm ok!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - NIGHT

      Some time has passed.

      We hear a BABY CRY, and find Bernie and Cinder peacefully
      huddling with newborn EMBER, the Blue Flame at their side.
      They speak softly in Firish.

                               CINDER
                  �k� ss �r.

                            BERNIE
                  B� ss ks�r�f.

      Bernie reaches into the lantern and scoops some of the Blue
      Flame into his hands and pours it over baby Ember's head. A
      blessing.

                               BERNIE
                  Oh.

      Delighted and proud, Bernie holds her up and smiles.

                            BERNIE
                  Welcome, my Ember, to your new
                  life.

      Baby Ember takes it in. She may not know what her father is
      saying but she can feel the love and excitement.

      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - LATER

      We start to PICK UP MOMENTUM as life continues on.

      -- Bernie holds the Blue Flame lantern as Ember, now a
      toddler, watches. He pours the flame carefully into a large
      empty cauldron.

                            BERNIE
                  Our Blue Flame hold all our
                  traditions and give us strength to
                  burn bright.

      Ember climbs up to the cauldron's edge. She watches in awe as
      the flame grows. It shoots up and she's knocked back! Ember
      takes in the brightness of the flame.

      Bernie steps in front of the cauldron.

                            BERNIE
                  Do I burn as bright?

      Goofing around, he flexes.

                            BERNIE
                  Hnnng. ERgggg. Hmmmm!

      -- The shop is mid-construction. Bernie pushes the BLUE FLAME
      CAULDRON into place as Ember, now big enough to stand on it,
      cheers him on. Cinder lovingly watches them as she hangs a
      curtain.

                            LITTLE KID EMBER
                  One, two! One, two! One, two!

      -- Bernie and Ember stand in front of an oscillating fan,
      taking turns making goofy faces and sounds.

                            LITTLE KID EMBER
                  Aaaaaahhhhhh.

                            BERNIE
                  Aaaaaahhhhhh.

                            LITTLE KID EMBER
                  Aaaaaahhhhhh.

      -- Bernie and Ember work on the shop sign together. Bernie
      writes "FIREPLACE" and Ember burns in a small flame design.

      TIME JUMP, the SIGN hangs over the front door of the shop.
      Bernie climbs down the ladder and joins Ember. They admire
      the sign together.

                  This shop is dream of our family!
                  And someday it'll all be yours

      Hers?? Ember's eyes grow in excitement. From that moment on,
      THIS is what she wants -- to be a good daughter and to take
      over the shop.

      TIME JUMP. The place is coming together. It's a bit corny,
      and over the top, but it's what Bernie wants: a shrine to
      Fire Land.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP

      Opening day. A fresh pot of Lava Java is ready to serve.

      A CUSTOMER enters, blown away by the decor. Bernie, Cinder
      and Ember light up!

                              BERNIE
                  Welcome!

                  Then I've got to try the kol-nuts.

                            BERNIE
                  Kol-nuts coming up!

      Ember sits on the counter next to Bernie. Imitating him, she
      taps on her own homemade toy register.

                            LITTLE KID EMBER
                  Kol-nut coming up!

      Together, Ember and Bernie prepare the order, squeezing logs
      in their palms to make bite size pieces of coal.

      Ember hands them to the customer.

                            LITTLE KID EMBER
                  Some day this shop will all be

      Time lapse of outside the shop. The community develops and
      more Fire Elements arrive.


      EXT. FIRE TOWN - A FEW YEARS LATER

      Ember, a bigger kid now, sits on her dad's shoulders as they
      ride a scooter around town, making deliveries.

                   BERNIE                          BIG KID EMBER
      Delivery!                            Delivery!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - ANOTHER YEAR

      The shop is even busier. Two FIRE KIDS approach the counter.

                            FIRE KID 1
                  Two sugar pops please!

      The bigger kid places a few coins on the counter in front of
      Bernie and Ember.

                            BIG KID EMBER
                  I got it, �shf�!

      Ember grabs a sugar pop and sculpts it. She molds the pop to
      look exactly like the kid. She hands it to them and their
      eyes grow in AWE.

      The littler kid takes a chomp.

                              FIRE KID 1
                  Hey!

      Just then, across the store, TWO WATER TEENAGERS enter. They
      laugh and jokingly push each other, splashing water and
      knocking things over.

      Bernie gives Ember a nod.

                            BERNIE
                  Water. Keep an eye on them.

      Ember SALUTES and slinks off.

      In an aisle, the snickering Water Teens take turns pouring
      water onto flaming souvenirs, putting them out.

                              WATER TEENAGER 1
                  Oops!

                              WATER TEENAGER 2
                  Oops!

      A roiling Ember jumps in front of them.

                            BIG KID EMBER
                  You splash it you buy it!

      Ember's eye's narrow, then she suddenly FLARES big!The Water
      Teenagers boil.

      A souvenir torch POPs from one of their hands and Ember
      catches it. The punks run sloppily out.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember stands in the doorway, smirking as the Water Teenagers
      run off. Bernie walks up with a smile.

                            BERNIE
                  You show them, huh?
                       (yells after)
                  Nobody waters down Fire!

      Ember shakes her fist.

                              BIG KID EMBER
                  Yeah!
                       (cursing in Firish)
                  Sh�sh� r �sh�!

      Bernie, startled, can't help but laugh. Ember looks up at
      him.

                            BIG KID EMBER
                  Can the shop be mine now?

      Bernie hugs her and tousles her flame.

                            BERNIE
                  When you are ready.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - MORE YEARS LATER

      We jump ahead more years. A Fire soap opera plays on a
      television above the counter.

                  She's not in love with him.

                            SOAP OPERA WOMAN
                       (melodramatic)
                  ...I'm NOT in love with you!

                            CINDER
                       (loud, cocky)
                  Ha! Knew it!

      At the counter, TEENAGE Ember is next to Bernie making coal
      nuts. She has surpassed him in speed, as he's slowed down.

      A CUSTOMER approaches the register.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  �shf�, customer.

                            BERNIE
                  How about...
                       (this is a first)
                  You take it today.

      Ember's eyes grow. This is a big deal.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                       (thrilled)
                  For real?

      She beams. Words she's waited to hear since she was a kid.

      She confidently walks to the register with a smile. Bernie
      backs away, thumbs up. Ember takes a deep breath.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  R�� kh�f! How can I help you?

      A customer with GLASSES places a METAL BASKET filled with
      small items on the counter -- next to it is a BUCKET filled
      with dozens of individual SPARKLERS.

                            SPARKLER CUSTOMER
                  All this, and the-- oh! The
                  sparklers are `buy one get one
                  free?'

                                                                   11.


                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  That's right!

                            SPARKLER CUSTOMER
                  Great! I'll just take the free one.

      The customer grabs a sparkler and lights it.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  Oh, no, see, you need to buy one to
                  get one free.

      Ember nicely takes the sparkler from the customer and blows
      it out.

                            SPARKLER CUSTOMER
                  But I just want the free one.

      The customer grabs another sparkler from the bucket.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  Sorry that's not how this works.

      Ember takes that sparkler from the customer a bit more
      emphatically.

                            SPARKLER CUSTOMER
                  But the customer is always right.

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                       (trying to be nice)
                  Not in this case...

      A beat, then in QUICK succession, the customer grabs another,
      Ember grabs it, they go back and forth, as Ember's
      frustration builds and she gathers a BOUQUET of sprinklers in
      her hand:

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                       (blows between each nope)
                  Nope. Nope. Nope! NOPE! NOPE!
                  NOPE!! NOPE!!

                            SPARKLER CUSTOMER
                  Just give me one for free!!

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS!!

      Suddenly, with a handful of sparklers, Ember's flame turns
      purple and she EXPLODES. A HUGE KABOOM!

      It clears, revealing devastation -- the customer's basket has
      fused with all the items into one melted smoking blob.

      There's a black scorch mark on the floor and other small
      fires smoke here and there -- It was a BIG explosion.

      Bernie pops into frame.

                              BERNIE
                  Oh!

      He grabs a few of the unlit sparklers, sticks them in the
      basket blob, blows on the them to LIGHT THEM, and hands it to
      the customer.

                            BERNIE
                  Happy birthday!

      Bernie quickly walks Ember out from behind the counter. Ember
      is shocked and upset.

                            BERNIE
                  What just happened? Why you lose
                  temper?

                            TEENAGE EMBER
                  I, I don't know. He was pushing and
                  pushing and it just--!!

                            BERNIE
                  Calm, calm. Sometimes customer can
                  be tough. Just take breath
                       (breath)
                  and make connection --

      Ember nods, taking this in. Bernie sweetly puts her apron
      back on.

                            BERNIE
                  When you can do that, and not lose
                  temper, then you will be ready to
                  take over shop.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SEVERAL YEARS LATER - PRESENT DAY

      TITLE OVER BLACK: SEVERAL YEARS LATER

      We COME UP ON THE SHOP, behind Ember at the counter. She's
      across from a complaining CUSTOMER:

                            CUSTOMER
                  ...This is too expensive and that
                  is not made in Fire Land...

                            EMBER
                  Take breath, make connection.

                                                                     13.


                 CUSTOMER                              EMBER
      And they weren't crunchy and            (breath)
      there wasn't enough sauce. I         Take breath, make connection.
      think this is rotten and you
      touch everything...

     Close on Ember's face, bright red with licks of purple.

            CUSTOMER (O.S.)                            EMBER
     Do you even have a license               (build)
     for this? Why are you                 Take breath, make connection.
     breathing like that?                  Take breath--

                            EMBER
                  --MAKE CONNECTION!!!!

      KA-BLAM. She EXPLODES. The large glass in the front counter
      SMASHES to pieces.

                              CUSTOMER
                  Ah!

      EMBER deflates, frustrated, and gives a GENUINE sorry look to
      shell-shocked customer:

                            EMBER
                       (embarrassed laugh)
                  Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry,
                  sorry.

      The shop regulars, FLARRY and FLARRIETTA, sit at a table with
      a FIRE DANGER sign. Flarry moves the arrow to the edge of
      purple.

                            FLARRIETTA
                  She almost went full purple! I've
                  never seen anyone go full purple!

                            EMBER
                       (to the shop)
                  Sorry everyone.

      Bernie hurries over to the customer.

                            BERNIE
                  Oh, please forgive my daughter. She
                  burn bright, but sometimes TOO
                  bright, eh?

      He blows out a burning flower on the customer's hat.

                            BERNIE
                  Nice hat by the way.

                            BERNIE
                  Let me make you a new batch! On the
                  house!

      The still stunned customer nods and walks away.

                              CUSTOMER
                  Okay.

      Ember jumps over the counter to scoop up all the glass
      pieces... while she cleans:

                            EMBER
                  Sorry �shf�. I don't know why that
                  one got away from me.

      She puts the glass in her mouth and starts chewing. Bernie
      moves into a station next to the counter that's filled with
      coals, he starts making the kol-nuts.

                            BERNIE
                  Oh you are tense because of big Red
                  Dot Sale tomorrow. It has us all at
                  a broil.

      Ember spits out the glass in a long glowing tube that she
      blows and molds into a pane.

                            EMBER
                  I guess. It's just, some of these
                  customers, they get me all, grrr.

      She accidentally smooshes the glass in her hands. Oops.

                            BERNIE
                  I know, I know. Just do what we
                  practice. You are SO good at
                  everything else.

                            EMBER
                  You're right. I'll get it. I just
                  want you to rest.

      Ember blows on the glass, smoothing it into shape. This is a
      natural talent of her's and she's proud of it.

                              EMBER
                  Mmhmm.

      She sets the glass into place.

                              EMBER
                  Done.

      Bernie goes back to making kol-nuts but bursts into a
      COUGHING fit.

                               EMBER
                  You okay?

                            BERNIE
                  Just tired.

                            EMBER
                  Let me help.

      She helps him off the coals and climbs in the station to take
      over.

      From across the store:

                            FLARRY
                  Bernie, that cough is terrible.

                            FLARRIETTA
                  Almost as terrible as your cooking.

                            BERNIE
                  �...sh�tsh...

                            FLARRIETTA
                  When you gonna put Ember out of her
                  misery and retire, huh? Finally put
                  her name on the sign out there?

                            BERNIE
                  Ah, she take over when she's ready.

      Ember's face briefly sinks. Not the answer she wanted. She
      hides the disappointment, puts her shields up and covers:

                            EMBER
                  And speaking of "ready," we are
                  MORE than ready for you to actually
                  BUY something, if you'd ever get up
                  off your lazy ash.

      The shop reacts with laughter and an "Oh! Burn!"

                               FLARRIETTA
                  Burn!
                          (laugh)

                            BERNIE

                  But she is SO close.

                  I mean, she'll probably never do
                  deliveries as quick as me...

      Ember puts the last kol-nut into the basket. She picks up a
      counter timer and cranks it.

                            EMBER
                  You don't think I can beat your
                  record? Because I've been taking it
                  easy on you so I don't hurt your
                  feelings, Mr. Smokestack.

                            EMBER
                  But game on!

      Bernie watches with a smile as Ember hurries to pack up
      deliveries.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      At the back of the shop, a beaded curtain hangs over the
      entrance to the hearth. A sandwich board advertises match
      making services.

      Ember whizzes by, collecting things for her delivery. We hear
      Cinder's voice from inside the hearth.

                            CINDER (O.S.)
                  Before I see...


      INT. CINDER'S MATCHMAKING OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      This looks like a fortune teller's room. CINDER sits on one
      side of a table across from a young, nervous FIRE COUPLE. In
      the center of the table stand two sticks.

                            CINDER (CONT'D)
                  ...if you are a match, I splash
                  this on your heart to bring love to
                  the surface.

      Cinder splashes them with oil.

                            CINDER
                  And I will read the smoke.

      They each light a stick and Cinder studies the smoke. Cinder
      leans in, excited.

      Just then, Ember throws open the curtains with a WHOOSH. The
      smoke dissipates.

                            CINDER
                  Ember! I'm doing a reading!

                            EMBER
                  Sorry, gotta grab some stuff.

      Ember starts collecting items.

                            EMBER
                  Going for Dad's record.

                            FIRE GUY
                  So... are we a match?

                            CINDER
                  It's true love!

      She turns toward Ember.

                            CINDER
                  Which is more than I ever smelled
                  on this one.

                            EMBER
                       (rolls her eyes)
                  Oh goodie. This ol' chestnut.

      As Ember moves toward the exit, Cinder grabs her arm and
      sniffs it.

                            CINDER
                       (sniff)
                  Yup, nothing. Just a loveless sad
                  future of sadness.

      Ember turns to leave but her mom stops her again.

                            CINDER
                  Ember! Work with me!

      Ember rolls her eyes.

                            CINDER
                  You finding match was my mother's
                  dying wish!


      INT. BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

      Ember's grandmother lays in bed with the family around.

                  Nice try, Mom. Gotta go!

      Ember exits and Cinder turns back to the couple who are now
      full-on making out.

      Cinder picks up a spray bottle and squirts.

                            CINDER
                  Save it for the wedding!

                              FIRE GUY
                         (react to spray bottle)
                  Hey!


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SOON AFTER

      Ember exits the shop rushing boxes to her scooter. CLOD, a
      pubescent EARTH BOY, pops out of a planter.

      He follows Ember as she loads her bike.

                            CLOD
                  Yo yo yo Ember!

                            EMBER
                  Yo Clod. Can't talk, in a hurry.
                  And don't let my dad catch you out
                  here again.

      Clod combs his hair with a gardening fork.

                            CLOD
                  What? C'mon. He doesn't like my
                  "laaandscaping?"

      Ember gives a half-smirk but keeps loading.

                              EMBER
                  Uff.

                            CLOD
                  Anyway, June Bloom is coming and
                  you just got to be my date. Cause
                  check it out! I'm all grown up!

      He lifts up his arm revealing a small flower.

                            CLOD
                       (sniff sniff)
                  And I smell goooood.

      He plucks the armpit flower and holds it out to her,
      kneeling.

                            CLOD
                  Ow! My queen.

      Ember takes the flower. POOF it burns.

                            EMBER
                  Sorry buddy. Elements don't mix.

      Ember LOOKS through the front window of the shop at the TIMER
      on the counter.

                            EMBER
                  Flame! Gotta go!

      She gets back to business. But Clod is persistent.

                            CLOD
                  Come on! Go to the festival with
                  me! You never leave this part of
                  town.

                            EMBER
                  That's because everything I need is
                  right here.

      Just then a WATER TRAIN passes by on an elevated track. Water
      splashes and Ember swiftly pops open her umbrella. She looks
      at the train crossing the bridge, annoyed. By contrast, Clod
      happily soaks up the shower.

                            EMBER
                  Plus the city isn't made with Fire
                  people in mind.

      Irritated, she closes her umbrella and hops on her scooter.

                            EMBER
                  Sorry, but it'd take an act of God
                  to get me to cross that bridge.

                            CLOD
                  An act of God or an act of... Clod?

      Ember starts her scooter and pulls away.

                               EMBER
                  Gotta run!

      She drives off.


      EXT. FIRE TOWN - CONTINUOUS

      We follow Ember as she makes her deliveries. And while she
      might seem TENSE in the shop, out here she seems FREE.

      -- She makes a delivery to a CHIMNEY STORE. They, in turn,
      give her gift.

      -- Ember pulls up to a HOT LOGS CART. She holds out a
      package. A FIRE CHEF pops up from the grill and takes it.

      -- Ember pulls up to a FIRE COUPLE pushing a charcoal grill
      down the sidewalk. She hands them a bottle of lighter fluid.

                            EMBER
                  As ordered.

      They lift the lid off the grill, revealing a tiny FIRE BABY
      keeping warm over the charcoals. One of the parents feeds the
      baby the bottle. The baby sucks on it and burbs flames.

                            EMBER
                  Gotta run! Going for dad's record.

      -- Ember is behind a SLOW old truck carrying wood. She loses
      her patience.

                               EMBER
                  Move it!

      She manuevers her scooter around the truck. She turns back,
      shakes her fist and calls back.

                            EMBER
                  Sh�sh� r �sh�!

      -- SHOTS CUTTING FASTER

      -- Ember delivers sandbags to a SMOKE CLEANERS experiencing a
      water leak.

      -- She hands off a parcel outside a WOODSHOP.

      -- She races by a FIREWORKS COMPANY dropping off a box of
      FIREWORKS. Kids swarm around the box, the contents explode
      and they cheer.

      Ember drives off with the fireworks going off behind her. The
      sequence ends with Ember racing home, happy, free.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - THAT NIGHT

      The shop's OPEN sign is turned inward. Ember rushes in,
      celebrating.

                            EMBER
                  Ha ha! Winner winner charcoal
                  dinner--

      She sees something and quickly catches the door so it won't
      slam.

      We reveal Bernie asleep at the counter, pen in hand and
      surrounded by sheets of red dot stickers.

      Ember softly shuts the door and tip toes in. She smiles
      lovingly, then cleans up the papers and drapes a chainmail
      shawl over his shoulders. He wakes with a SMOKE COUGH.

      Ember gently pulls a red dot sticker off his cheek.

                            EMBER
                  Head to bed. I'll close things up.

      Bernie gets up and Ember follows.

                            BERNIE
                  Still have much to prepare for Red
                  Dot Sale.

                            EMBER
                  Dad, I'll take care of it. You need
                  to rest.

      Just then the TIMER rings. Bernie looks at the timer, then to
      Ember with excitement.

                              BERNIE
                  How?

                            EMBER
                  I learned from the best.

      They share a warm laugh. Ember puts a hand on Bernie's back
      and leads him across the shop. As they approach the Blue
      Flame, Bernie starts coughing again.

                            BERNIE
                  I am old. I can't do this forever.

      He picks up a stick from the base of the Blue Flame's
      cauldron.

                            BERNIE
                  Now that you have beaten my time
                  there is only one thing you haven't
                  done... tomorrow I sleep in. And I
                  want YOU to run shop for Red Dot
                  sale.

                            EMBER
                  Seriously?? By myself??

                            BERNIE
                  If you can do that without losing
                  your temper, it will show me you
                  are able to take over.

      He breaks the twig in two and hands a piece to Ember.

                            EMBER
                       (this is HUGE)
                  You got it �shf�.

      Bernie holds the twig with both hands and closes his eyes.
      Then he tosses it into the Blue Flame. Ember beams.

                            EMBER
                  I won't let you down. I swear.
                  You'll see.

      They share a warm hug.

                            BERNIE
                  Hmm. Good daughter.

      Bernie slowly climbs the stairs. Ember watches him go, then
      flares up, excited.

                              EMBER
                  Yes!

      Ember turns to the Blue Flame. Just like Bernie, she holds
      her stick and closes her eyes before tossing it into the
      cauldron.

                            EMBER
                  Blue Flame, please let this go my
                  way.

      EXT. FIRETOWN - SAME TIME

      We look over the smoky rooftops of Firetown toward Element
      City.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - THE NEXT MORNING

      The streets of Firetown are waking up.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      We see QUICK SHOTS of EMBER slapping RED DOT STICKERS on
      items.

      She stands at the front door and takes a moment to adjust the
      RED DOT SALE pin on her apron.

                            EMBER
                  Take a breath.
                       (breath)
                  Calm as a candle.

      She rolls up the front window shade and sees a wall of
      customers waiting to come in. Her eyes go wide for a moment
      but then she puts on a smile and opens the door.

                            EMBER
                  Morning. Welcome to the Fireplace--

      Customers RUSH in and she's practically trampled.

      We go to a series of POPS of the sale. It's chaotic, like
      Black Friday. Ember fights to keep her cool.

      -- A CUSTOMER yanks on a can at the bottom of a pyramid
      display, shaking the whole stack. Ember rushes up.

                            EMBER
                  Whoa whoa, they're all the same.
                  Just take one from the top.
                       (then, chipper)
                  Thanks for shopping.

      -- A CUSTOMER heaves an armload of red stickers onto the
      counter

                            STICKER CUSTOMER
                       (effort)
                  So many stickers for sale!

      -- A customer sweeps a whole shelf of Blue Flame trinkets
      into a basket.

                  Are these fragile?

                              EMBER
                  No wait!

      SMASH. Several trinkets fall and break.

      -- Ember stops a CUSTOMER from putting a log in their mouth:

                            EMBER
                  You have to pay before you eat.

      -- A crescendo of SUPER QUICK SHOTS of Ember at the register.

      All she can see is faces and questions and items being shoved
      toward her.

                            CUSTOMERS
                  Does this come in a large? / What's
                  your return policy? / These glasses
                  are backward. / I want a refund. /
                  I'm next!! / Has anyone seen my
                  husband?

      INTERCUT TO CLOSE UPS OF EMBER TRYING TO BREATH THROUGH
      ANGER.

                            EMBER
                       (through gritted teeth)
                  Take breath.

      A kid holds up a broken toy.

                            KID CUSTOMER
                  My dad broke this.

                            EMBER
                       (through gritted teeth)
                  Make connection...

      A high-pitched kettle starts to whistle.

                            KETTLE CUSTOMER
                  Mind if I test this kettle?

      It's too much. Ember is on the verge of EXPLODING. Smoke
      building and fire roiling. With gritted teeth and a SUPER
      STRAINED voice, her color starts turning more purple...

                            EMBER
                  Be back in 5 minutes!

      She rushes awkwardly out, sparks and flame blasting, hands
      covering her mouth, barely contained.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BASEMENT

      Ember rushes down the basement steps, her fire SPITTING AND
      SPARKING.

      She hurries to an area away from the door and LETS IT OUT!

                              EMBER
                  AHHHHHH!

      Her fire BLASTS. As the smoke clears, there's a LOUD
      VIBRATION from a pipe.

      CUT TO upstairs, the pipes in the shop are vibrating too. The
      customers look around, concerned.

      Back in the basement, the pipe cracks and SHOOTS a fire-hose-
      like stream of water right at Ember!

      It douses part of her flame and she ducks away.

      More streams burst from the pipe, spraying all over the
      basement.

      Ember panics. Water is SPRAYING EVERYWHERE, filling the
      basement and HURTING HER.

      She has to dodge the spray. Thinking quick, she picks up an
      umbrella and, getting STUNG by water, jumps toward the pipe.

      She uses her hands to heat the pipe and weld the crack,
      stopping the leak.

      Then, she surveys the damage. The basement is completely
      flooded.

                            EMBER
                  Oh no no no no no.
                       (whispering, total panic)
                  Stupid temper! Not today!

      Ember's flame is damaged. She quickly grabs sticks from a
      bucket and eats them, growing her flame.

                            EMBER
                  What is wrong with me?

      Just then, A PICTURE FRAME floats to the surface of the water
      and starts to move.

      Then two streams of water fountain up out of the pool and two
      hands holding the frame appear... WADE sits up out of the
      water, bawling his eyes out.

                            EMBER
                  What the--?

      He looks at the picture, moved, crying.

                            WADE
                  What a happy family. Is that you
                  and your DAD??

      The frame holds a photo of young Ember and her parents. She
      is held up by Bernie, blowing fire on a birthday cake, the
      candles sparking.

                            WADE
                  I love dads. And it's your
                  birthday!

      His tears splash Ember.

                            EMBER
                  Who are you? What are you doing
                  here?

                            WADE
                       (still crying)
                  I don't know! I was searching for a
                  leak on the other side of the river
                  and got sucked in. This is bad! I
                  can't lose another job! I just
                  can't seem to find my flow.

      He stands, revealing himself for the first time. And he's
      HUNKY, CUT. Ember can't help but notice.

                              EMBER
                  Dang.

      Then Wade looks down at himself.

                            WADE
                  Ugh, that pipe squished me all out
                  of shape.

      He shakes and PLOPS back into his regular bouncy Wade shape.

                            WADE
                  That's better.

                  what I did.

                            WADE
                  Ooo, actually...

      Wade sloshes his way over to a junction of several pipes.
      Frowning, her pulls a notepad and pen out from under his
      shirt.

                            WADE
                  I'm afraid I'm going to have to
                  write you a ticket.

      He starts scribbling on the pad.

                               EMBER
                  A ticket??

                            WADE
                  Yeah. I'm a city inspector. And
                  this pipe is definitely not up to
                  code.

                            EMBER
                  I sucked a city inspector into our
                  pipes??

                            WADE
                  I know, ironic, right?

      Wade taps on the pipe.

                            EMBER
                  Stop messing with that!

                            WADE
                  I need to make sure it's solid.

                            EMBER
                  Everything's solid. I should know.
                  My dad re-built this place himself.

                            WADE
                  Wait, your dad did?

                            EMBER
                  Yes! With his bare hands. Every
                  brick and board. It was a ruin when
                  he found it.

                            WADE
                  Wow. He did all of this himself?
                       (getting weepy)
                  Without permits?

                              EMBER
                  Uh...

      Wade's tears start to flow again.

                            WADE
                  I'm gonna have   to write that up
                  too. First I'm   sucked into a pipe
                  and now I have   to write citations
                  that could get   this place shut
                  down. Oh gosh,   it's just too much!

      Ember instantly FLAMES UP.

                            EMBER
                  Shut us DOWN??

                            WADE
                  I know! It's awful!

                            EMBER
                  No! You can't shut us down. Please!
                  This is a big day for me. It's our
                  Red Dot Sale!

      Ember flares her arms out trying to grab the ticket book.

                            WADE
                  Hey, take it easy. This is as hard
                  on me on as it is on you.

                            EMBER
                  Get back here!!

      Wade runs for the other side of the room.

                            WADE
                  Sorry! I gotta get these to city
                  hall before the end of my shift.

      He slips out a basement window. Ember lunges after him.

      She looks at her Red Dot Sale button then rips off her apron,
      tosses it on the ground.

                              EMBER
                  Flame!

      BEHIND HER we see another pipe-joint begin to leak -- the
      problem is NOT over, but she doesn't notice.

      She climbs out the window and chases after Wade.

                            EMBER
                  Get back here!

      REVEAL Bernie looking out the window. He sees Ember chase
      Wade down the street.

                              BERNIE
                  Hmm?


      EXT. FIRETOWN - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember chases Wade to the the train PLATFORM -- the train she
      said it'd take an act of God for her to get on.

                            TRAIN ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                  Next stop, Element City.

      Down the platform, Wade, not seeing Ember, steps into a
      waiting train. She has to follow. Crap.

      She looks back at Firetown.

      As the doors start to close, Ember throws on her hood and
      SLIPS into the last car.


      INT. ELEVATED TRAIN CAR - RIGHT AFTER

      She scans for Wade. But the train is CROWDED -- and Ember is
      right -- the city is definitely NOT made with Fire Elements
      in mind.

      She tries to work her way toward the front, carefully
      squeezing past a HUGE grassy Earth Element, but the train
      lurches.

                              EMBER
                  Whoa!

      She slams into the grass man. POOF his grass burns up leaving
      a very skinny guy.

                              EARTH ELEMENT
                  Hay!

                              EMBER
                  Sorry!



�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                   30.


      She looks ahead, there's Wade. But it's too crowded for her
      to squeeze through. There has to be another way.

      Thinking fast, she climbs out a window.


      EXT. TRAIN - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember's fire is whipped by the wind as she inches along the
      outside of the train car.

      It's dangerous -- Water SPLASHES from the aqueduct and
      they're fast approaching tunnel under a GIANT waterfall!

      In a panic, Ember melts her way through a window--


      INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

      -- and into the train car, just in time.

      But it's pitch black because of the tunnel. She's the only
      light source. She moves through the car looking for Wade and
      illuminating startled Elements.

      Then she sees a flame hovering in front of her. Odd.

                              EMBER
                  Huh?

      She moves closer... could it be her own reflection?

                              EMBER
                  What the?

      Just then the train exits the tunnel and the car is bright
      again and she sees that what she was looking at was her
      reflection was on the back of Wade's head!

      But she's got the tickets in sight. They're in his hand.
      She's so close. She slowly reaches toward them, but her heat
      causes Wade's hand to quietly BOIL...

                            TRAIN ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                  THIS STOP CITY HALL.

      Feeling this, Wade looks down and is startled see Ember is
      still following him.

                            WADE
                  Ah ah ah! Hands off!

      He quickly whips the tickets away from her and hurries out
      the open doors.

                                                                   31.


                              EMBER
                  Gah!

      She follows but has to dodge passengers loading onto the
      train.

                            EMBER
                  Ooh, sorry.


      EXT. ELEMENT CITY - TRAIN STATION - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember exits the train to find that she's in the middle of her
      worst nightmare -- a city crowded with ELEMENTS.

                              EMBER
                  Ugh.

      Then she spots Wade at the bottom of the stairs, headed
      toward a busy street. He weaves easily through the crowds.

                              EMBER
                  Stop!!

      The chase is on. Ember rushes down a busy staircase... she
      flails, collides with other people and tumbles down the steps
      into a lamp post.

      But she's not giving up. She leaps to her feet.

                              EMBER
                  Stop!!

      She gets to the busy street and stops for traffic just as an
      AIR ELEMENT steps in front of a car. POOF! He's hit, then
      reforms, his jacket laying in the street.

                            AIR ELEMENT
                  Aw! My new jacket.

      Ember bolts across the street.


      EXT. STREET - VARIOUS - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember races down the sidewalk toward Wade who passes a
      NURSERY SCHOOL BUS. He easily hops over the crowd of little
      EARTH KIDS.

      Ember follows, but the kids are blocking her path.

      Thinking fast, she pops open her umbrella and flares up. Like
      a hot air balloon, she lifts up and over the kids. They're
      amazed.


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                  32.


      She keeps soaring until she passes over the EARTH KIDS.
      Suddenly, her umbrella melts and gives out. She falls to the
      ground landing hard, then springs to her feet and keeps
      chasing Wade who now realizes he's being chased. Yikes!

      He takes a sharp left, appearing to splash into the side of a
      building. Ember skids to a stop and sees he's slipped into a
      very narrow space between two buildings.

      She squeezes her fire and follows him. Crammed, they both
      shimmy through the extremely tight passageway.

      Wade makes it to the other side but his ticket book gets
      stuck in the crack. He desperately pulls and gets it free
      JUST as Ember bursts from the crack and swipes for the ticket
      book.

      But Wade gets away and darts through traffic toward City Hall
      as Ember follows.


      EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

      Wade hurries to the building with Ember still in hot pursuit.
      She swipes a bottle of CHILI OIL from a DIRT BURGER VENDOR's
      cart.

                            DIRT BURGER VENDOR
                  My chili oil!

      Ember makes it to City Hall first and jumps in front of
      Wade's path, exhausted. She sprays the oil in a line in front
      of her then stomps on it creating a HUGE WALL OF FIRE.

                            EMBER
                  Come on, guy. You can't get through
                  this. So it is time to hand `em
                  over.

                            WADE
                  Oh boy. I'm sorry. This is going to
                  be really disappointing for you--

      Wade steps onto a drain and PLOP disappears, then pops up
      through another grate on the other side of Ember right next
      to the building. He hurries inside.

                            EMBER
                  Oh no no no no no no...

      But he rushes into a revolving door.

                            EMBER
                  No no no no no no!


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                33.


                              WADE
                  Sorry!

      And slips into the building. Ember's flame shrinks in defeat.

                            EMBER
                  Please! No! You don't understand.

      Ember slumps on the steps, her fire dims and reveals an inner
      prismatic light.

      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS, Wade puts the tickets in a
      canister. But just as he's putting the canister into a vacuum
      tube -- FOOMP! -- he SEES caustics cast on the wall from
      Ember's prismatic light.

                              WADE
                  Whoa.

      He turns to see Ember outside, desperate, pleading to the
      closed door, more to herself, her light private, prismatic,
      vulnerable.

                            EMBER
                  The shop is my dad's dream, if I'm
                  the reason it gets shut down it
                  will kill him.

      INSIDE, Wade's face looks pained, empathetic.

                              WADE
                  Aw.

                            EMBER
                  He will never trust me to take
                  over.

      Wade comes out of the building.

                            WADE
                  Why didn't you say that before?

      Ember INSTANTLY ZIPS her fire up, shields on.

                            EMBER
                  Wait, does that mean you'll tear up
                  the tickets?

                            WADE
                  I mean, I would. But I just sent
                  them over to the processing
                  department.

      Wade gestures to the root vacuum system inside the doors.
      Ember grips her head in frustration.

                            WADE
                  But, I can take you there so you
                  can plead your case.

      Ember looks back at him, hopeful again.


      INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember and Wade travel down a dim hallway. Above them, a
      system of pulsing VINES lead to a door at the end of the
      hall.


      INT. FERN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Wade opens the door into a jungle of an office.

      Ember follows him in through a tangle of leafy vines. Wade
      walks through a branch. It snaps back at Ember and she ducks.

                              EMBER
                  Whoa!

      They break through to find an overgrown Earth Element, FERN,
      a low-key humorless bureaucrat with PILES of paper in his
      inbox.

      Behind his desk are a series of vacuum tubes made from VINES.

                            WADE
                  Hey, Fern! How you doing?

                            FERN
                  Living the dream.

      Fern inserts a roll of papers into a canister.

                            WADE
                  You know those citations I just
                  gave you from Firetown?

                            FERN
                  I was about to send them to Mrs.
                  Cumulus then get sprayed for fungus
                  rot.

      Fern moves to put the canister into the tube.

                   EMBER                             WADE
      Wait!                                Wait!

                            WADE
                       (sotto to Ember)
                  Tell him what you told me. About
                  your dad and letting him down.

                            EMBER
                       (sotto)
                  No. That's personal.

                            WADE
                       (sotto)
                  It really got to me. He might feel
                  it too...

      Wade keepings talking as Ember tries to cover his mouth.

                            WADE
                  Her dad will be sup--

                              EMBER
                  Nope!

                              WADE
                  Sup--

                              EMBER
                  Nope!

                            WADE
                  Super disa--

      She then grabs Fern's nameplate and, SPLTT!, shoves it into
      Wade's mouth.

                            WADE
                  --ppointed in her.

      Ember is triggered by Wade exposing her.

                              EMBER
                  Stop it!

      Wade keeps talking with the nameplate in his head.

                       (to Fern)
                  He might even be...

      Ember shoves a globe into his face, knocking out the
      nameplate...

                            WADE
                       (full mouth)
                  ...ASHAMED.

                            EMBER
                  What are you doing?

      Ember's flame starts to show some PURPLE. She starts stress
      breathing.

                            WADE
                       (to Fern, weepy)
                  But the main thing is if her father
                  can't retire...

      Fern moves the canister closer to the tube.

                            WADE
                  ...It will be ALL EMBER'S.. FFFF-

      EMBER CUTS HIM OFF!

                            EMBER
                  STOP TALKING!

      Ember EXPLODES in a ball of fire. When the smoke clears we
      see ALL of the stacks of citations have been fried. Except
      Ember's that are in the canister. Wade douses a still flaming
      bobble head. Fern's charred desk collapses.

                            FERN
                  Looks like I'm going home early
                  today.

      He puts the canister into the tube.

                            EMBER
                  No, don't--

      The tickets shoot out of the office. Failure.

                            FERN
                  Expect to get shut down within a
                  week. Have a good one.

      Fern hands Ember a brochure. She takes it and turns away,
      dejected. Wade watches, concerned.

                              WADE
                  Sorry.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - LATER

      Ember walks, dejected, over the culvert bridge. She stares at
      the brochure Fern gave her -- there's a chipper cartoon of an
      element being booted out of their business, along with the
      words "So your business is being shut down!"

                                                                   37.


      As she approaches the shop she sees a "closed" sign on the
      door and goes into an instant panic:

                              EMBER
                  What?!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      Ember enters the shop, concerned.

                              EMBER
                  Already??

      She looks around the empty shop and tucks the brochure into
      her pocket.

                              EMBER
                  Hello?

      She hears Bernie coughing in the basement.

      She rushes downstairs and freezes: pipes are now bursting and
      leaking EVERYWHERE. Her parents are desperately trying to
      repair the damage. Bernie stands precariously on top of a
      ladder.

                            EMBER
                  Oh no. Dad! What happened??

                            BERNIE
                  We lucky nobody hurt. It RUIN Red
                  Dot Sale! Did he do this?

                              EMBER
                  Who?

                            BERNIE
                  The Water guy I see you chase.

      Water drips onto Bernie's face.

                              BERNIE
                         (pain)
                  Ah!

                            EMBER
                  Oh, uh, um...

      Ember weighs this for a moment, as she hops off the stairs
      and begins repairing a pipe. She could come clean. But
      instead...

                                                                38.


                            EMBER
                  Yeah. He did. Uh, he just broke
                  through a pipe.
                       (clears throat)
                  I don't know why. Luckily I was
                  able close it off. I, uh, couldn't
                  catch him though.

      Bernie flares up.

                            BERNIE
                  Water. Always trying to water us
                  down!

                            EMBER
                  He was a Water PERSON, dad, not
                  just water.

                            BERNIE
                       (grumble)
                  Same thing. And why is water in
                  pipes? City shut down years ago.
                  There should be NO WATER!

      Bernie's fury causes a coughing fit. He falls over backward.

                              BERNIE
                  Ah!

                              EMBER
                  Dad!!!

      Ember catches him just before he hits the water.

                              CINDER
                  Bernie!

      Bernie coughs. Cinder leads him to the stairs.

                            CINDER
                  We will get through this. Just like
                  before.

                              EMBER
                  Before?

      Bernie sits, Cinder looks to Ember.

                            CINDER
                  There is a reason we left Fire
                  Land.

      Cinder holds Bernie's arm, she wants to talk about it. Bernie
      looks down. Cinder smiles at a memory.

      She's almost talking MORE to Bernie, reassuring him they did
      the right thing -- she KNOWS his deeper wound.

                            CINDER
                  Oh, Ember. We loved it there so
                  much. Most everyone had a Blue
                  Flame, and it connected us all
                  together...


      EXT. FIRE LAND - FLASHBACK

      Fade to an aerial view of Fire Land, glowing homes clustered
      on a rocky hillside.

                            CINDER
                  ...to our traditions, our family.

      The camera passes ground-floor windows and we get FLEETING
      GLIMPSES of FAMILY FLAMES, until we stop at a window of a
      FAMILY SHOP that has a Blue Flame burning in a cauldron
      inside. A YOUNG BERNIE stands on a ladder, putting up a sign.
      He looks to a VERY PREGNANT Cinder who smiles, so proud.

                            CINDER (V.O.)
                  It was hard living, but your father
                  began to build a life for us. We
                  put everything into it. But then a
                  great storm came.

      There's a PULSE of wind and Bernie and Cinder's flames
      flicker ominously. Worried, they look up to the sky and see a
      large dark storm above the rooftops. And then it hits them --
      FEROCIOUS WINDS.

      SOON AFTER, inside the shop, debris crashes down, knocking
      over the cauldron with the Blue Flame. Thinking quickly,
      Bernie thrusts a lantern into the Blue Flame to capture it.
      They huddle together as the building collapses around them.

      LATER, they stand in the rubble, devastated. We can see the
      destruction isn't everywhere... some buildings were lost like
      theirs, others are only slightly damaged.

                            CINDER (V.O.)
                  All was lost for us.

      LATER that night, Cinder sleeps on the floor, but Bernie is
      awake. He looks to his lantern with the Blue Flame he saved
      and prays to it then looks to pregnant Cinder.

                             CINDER (V.O.)
                  Your father understood...
                        (painful memory, but
                        resolute in the decision)
                  We HAD to leave... everything. Our
                  home.

      After a moment, he gets his answer -- a LOOK OF RESOLVE
      crosses his face.

      LATER, we find Bernie and Cinder on the beach. They walk
      toward a boat, about to leave for their new life.

                            CINDER (V.O)
                  It was the only way to create a
                  better life!

      As they board, Bernie looks back at his parents. Stoic, they
      watch him leave. The boat pulls away from the shore and
      Bernie and Cinder watch their homeland recede in the
      distance.

                            CINDER (V.O.)
                  It was the last time your father
                  ever saw his family.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Fade back to the basement, Bernie somberly mops up puddles as
      Cinder finishes the story.

                            CINDER
                  That is why we came here. To build
                  all this.

      Ember is floored. She looks at the brochure from Fern, then
      tucks it away and walks over to Bernie with resolve:

                            EMBER
                  �shf�... nothing will happen to
                  this shop or the flame again. I
                  promise.

      Ember takes the mop from her father. He smiles and places his
      hand on her cheek.

                            BERNIE
                  Mm. Good daughter.


      EXT. CITY HALL - THE NEXT MORNING

      Elements bustle outside City Hall during the morning commute.

      INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Wade listens to music on his way into work. The sound waves
      from his headphones vibrate through his head. He's deep into
      it, eyes closed, as he approaches the entrance to his
      department. He doesn't see a FIRE burning on the floor next
      to the door. It catches his bag on fire. Wade looks down,
      shocked!

                            WADE
                  Ah! Fire. Fire! Ah! Fire!

      He pats out his bag, then starts to stomp on the fire.
      Suddenly EMBER stands up, emerging from under a chainmail
      blanket... the fire was her.

                              EMBER
                  Hey HEY!

                             WADE
                  Oh. Sorry!
                       (checking his burnt bag)
                  You're so hot!

                             EMBER
                       (raised eyebrow)
                  Excuse me?

                            WADE
                  No! I mean like you're smokin'! No,
                  I didn't mean it like tha--

                            EMBER
                  Are you done yet?

      Wade is dripping.

                            WADE
                  Yes please.

                            EMBER
                  I'm waiting to talk to your boss.
                  So make like a stream and... flow
                  somewhere else.

      Ember settles back down on the ground.

                            WADE
                  Actually, Gale won't be in today.
                  She's a HUGE airball fan and the
                  Windbreakers are finally in the
                  playoffs! Toot Toot!

      Ember is unaffected by Wade's enthusiasm. She flares up in
      frustration.

                              EMBER
                  UGH!

                            WADE
                  Okay... Well, I just came by
                  because I left my passes for the
                  game here last night.

      Wade starts to walk away but Ember perks up.

                            EMBER
                  Passes? Like, plural?

      He turns back. Then it hits him, is she serious?


      EXT. CYCLONE STADIUM - LATER

      Ember and Wade walk up the Wetro stairs into the middle of
      the busy Air District.

      Ember is intimidated by the crowds of AIR BALL FANS flooding
      into the entrance of CYCLONE stadium. She pulls her hood
      tight around her flame.

      The marquis reads WIND BREAKERS VS CROPDUSTERS.


      INT. CYCLONE STADIUM - AFTER

      Inside, it's a huge, amazing space. Like Madison Square
      Garden on steroids. High above, CLOUD PLAYERS battle mid
      game, passing a ball toward a hoop.

      Ember enters with Wade. She has never seen anything like it.
      She is WAY out of her element.

                            EMBER
                  Where is she?

                            WADE
                  Up there, in that skybox.

      Wade points to one of the sky boxes where GALE, Wade's
      supervisor, sits. She's a storm cloud, complete with
      lightning, and is completely engrossed in the game.

                              GALE
                  Come on!

      Ember steels herself:

                                                                     43.


                               EMBER
                          (breath)
                  Okay.

                            EMBER
                       (action hero)
                  Time to cancel some tickets.

      They walk towards Gale's box, passing a drink vendor.

                            TOOT TOOT JUICE VENDOR
                  Toot toot juice! Getcha toot toot
                  juice! Toot juice! Getcha toot toot
                  juice!

      They get to the row behind Gale's box. Everyone sitting there
      is Water.

                            WADE
                       (super encouraging)
                  You'll be great! This way.

      Wade walks down the row. Everyone seems to know him. Ember
      gets a look of determination on her face -- she's not going
      to fail! She then does that tight walk you have to do in
      stadiums where everyone has to stand to let you through.

                  EMBER                                 WADE
      Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon. Oh            (greeting friends)
      sorry. Fire girl coming              Jimmy, what's up? Wendy! How
      through.                             good is it to be here?

     The Water Elements start to boil as she passes -- she's
     desperate not to hurt anyone.

     They take their seats behind Gale's box. Gale yells at the
     game, getting THUNDERY.

                           GALE
                 Break some wind!!

     Ember clears her throat and calls to her:

                           WADE
                 Hi Gale. How you doing?

     Gale glances back at her.

                           GALE
                 Look at the score. What do you
                 think??

     She turns back to the game with a rumble.

                  Lumen. My family runs a Fire
                  shop... Wade wrote us a bunch of
                  tickets yesterday and--

      BUZZER! Game going south. Gale gets stormier, her winds blow
      in Ember and Wade's faces.

                            GALE
                  What kind of call was that??!!
                       (half-paying attention)
                  Lumen? Yeah, Fire shop with thirty
                  citations...

                            EMBER
                       (shocked to Wade)
                  Thirty??

      Wade shrugs apologetically. Ember turns back to Gale.

                            EMBER
                  Anyway, friend, I was hoping we
                  could work something out--

      BUZZER again! Gale erupts.

                            GALE
                  Come on Ref! ARE YOUR EYES IN THE
                  BACK OF YOUR HEAD??

      The AIR REF'S eyes literally pop out the back of his head as
      he GLARES at Gale.

                              WADE
                  Oh no!

      But not reading the mood, Ember tries again.

                            EMBER
                  Yeah bummer, aww yeah. Okay, so the
                  30 citations--

      Gale whips around to face Ember, annoyed.

                            GALE
                  Do you mind? There's a GAME going
                  on.

      As she turns back toward the game,

                                                                  45.


                              GALE
                  Fireball.

      This gets to Ember. Her flame starts to spark and roil.

                              EMBER
                  Fireball?

      She steps in front of Gale's box, between her and the game.

                             EMBER
                       (getting annoyed)
                  Actually, I do mind. This is my
                  LIFE we're talking about. Not just
                  some game.

      Gale THUNDERS huge with LIGHTNING.

                            GALE
                  "Some game?" This is the PLAYOFFS.
                  So forgive me if I don't want to
                  hear a sob story about the problems
                  of some little shop.

      Ember's flames get bigger too. We see licks of PURPLE.

                            EMBER
                  Well that "little shop" matters WAY
                  more than a bunch of over-paid
                  cloud puffs blowing some ball
                  around.

      Ember and Gale are nose to nose.

                             GALE
                  I dare you. Say "cloud puffs" one
                  more time.

                            EMBER
                       (in her face)
                  Cloud. Puffs.

      Ember blows away Gale's nose. Gale furious, growls back.

      Ember's fire ROARS. They angrily stare each other down as
      tension quickly builds.

      The crowd boos.

                              WADE
                  Oh no!

      Gale's eyes dart to the game.

      Huh?? Ember looks to the game.

                              WADE
                  Lutz!

      LUTZ, one of the players, tries to block the play but fails.

      The home team is scored on again. As the crowd boos, Lutz's
      spirit sinks.

                            WADE
                  Lutz man, he's been in such a funk
                  `cause his mom has been sick.

      Lutz has the ball stolen from him. The crowd keeps booing.

                            WADE
                  That is so not cool. He's doing his
                  best.

      Wade suddenly stands and shouts.

                            WADE
                  We love you Lutz!

      Ember ducks and looks away from him.

                              WADE
                  LUUUUTZ!

      Wade starts gesturing to the fans around him to join the
      chant.

                            WADE
                  We love you Lutz! We love you Lutz!
                  C'mon! We love you Lutz! Everybody!

                  CROWD                                 WADE
      We love you Lutz! We love you           (with the crowd)
      Lutz! We love you Lutz! We           We love you Lutz! We love you
      love you Lutz!                       Lutz! We love you Lutz! We
                                           love you Lutz!

     Lutz looks over at their section, clearly touched.

     The whole stadium picks up the cheer. Then Wade starts an
     ACTUAL WAVE of Water People that goes all the way around the
     stadium.

                           WADE
                 Whooooooaaaaa...




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                   47.


                            CROWD
                       (doing a wave)
                  Whooooooaaaaa...

      Ember opens her umbrella just as the wave SPLASHES OVER them.

      ON THE COURT, Lutz is energized.

      He blasts up to the top of the stadium and SLAMS the ball
      into the net for a score. The crowd goes wild.

      Ember even gets caught up in the moment. It's a stadium
      ELECTRIFIED!

                            EMBER
                       (cheering)
                  Ah, yes! Yes!

                            WADE
                       (cheering, celebrating,
                       tearing up)
                  Woo! Way to go Lutz!

      Lutz holds his arms up - success!

                            WADE
                       (cheering)
                  Yeah Lutz! That was amazing Lutz!

      Wade high-fives everyone around them.

                            WADE
                       (high-fiving)
                  Uh! Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

      Ember looks at Wade, amazed at what he just did.

                              WADE
                  Woo hoo!

      Wade tries to high five her, she instinctively leans away.

                              WADE
                  Oh.

      He high fives himself.


      EXT. CYCLONE STADIUM - LATER

      JUMP AHEAD to the front entrance. Rowdy Elements pour out of
      the stadium, cheering.

      We find Gale celebrating. Ember walks next to her.

                                                                    48.


                            GALE
                  Wohoo! What a comeback!

      REVEAL Wade covered head to toe in Windbreakers merch,
      including two foam hands, a puffy wig and cloud-shaped
      glasses.

                            WADE
                  Check out who found the gift shop!
                  Woo!

      Ember does a double-take at Wade with a smile... this guy is
      ridiculous, then to Gale:

                  EMBER                                 WADE
      I gotta admit that WAS pretty           (still celebrating)
      cool.                                Uh! Yeah!

                           GALE
                 You can see why I can get all
                 churned up. But as a "cloud puff"
                 who used to come here with her dad,
                 these wins mean a little bit more.

                           EMBER
                 And as a "Fireball" who's supposed
                 to take over her dad's shop...
                      (softening, not easy to
                      say)
                 ...I sure don't want to let him
                 down... and I could use a win too.

     Ember's letting her guard down a little.

                           EMBER
                 Now I just gotta stop water from
                 coming in--

                           GALE
                 WATER? In FIRETOWN?

                             EMBER
                 Yeah?

                           GALE
                 Water was shut off to there YEARS
                 ago. Forget the tickets, I'm gonna
                 have to TAKE APART YOUR DAD'S SHOP
                 to figure out what's going on!!

                           EMBER
                 YOU CAN'T! My dad put his WHOLE
                 LIFE into that place!

                       (angry detective, to
                       Wade)
                  ARGG. I bet this is connected to
                  that fluffin' leak.

                            WADE
                       (to a freaked out Ember)
                  Yeah, we've been trying to track
                  down a leak in the city. It's why I
                  was in the canal and--WAIT!!
                       (to Gale)
                  I know where I got sucked into
                  Ember's shop! Ember and I could
                  track the water from her shop to
                  find the SOURCE OF THE LEAK!

                            GALE
                  Keep talking.

                            WADE
                  I could call in a city crew to fix
                  whatever we find.

                            EMBER
                       (getting on board)
                  Yes! And there'd be no need to
                  touch my dad's shop!

      Gale thinks, then smiles at their hopeful faces.

                            GALE
                  You're lucky you're a cute couple.

                            EMBER
                  Oh, we're not a--

                            GALE
                  You got until FRIDAY. If you can
                  find the leak and get a crew to fix
                  it by then those tickets are
                  forgiven. If not? YOUR DAD'S SHOP
                  gets shut down.

      Ember feels the weight of this. Gale flies up into the
      flowing air crowd, hooting, cheering:

                            GALE
                  WOOHOO! BREAK WIND! BREAK WIND!

                               EMBER
                  Thank you!

      Ember exhales... she got a reprieve. She looks to Wade.

                            EMBER
                  Please take all that off.

                            WADE
                  But I got you a hat!

      Wade puts the hat on Ember's head. We go wide to see a huge
      plume of fire and smoke explode above her.

      Back on them, that hat is gone and Wade's outfit is singed.

                               WADE
                  Okay.


      INT/EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - NIGHT

      Ember and Wade walk up to the shop.

                            EMBER
                  Just keep outta sight, okay? It'd
                  be a whole thing.

      They hear Bernie from inside the shop, he's livid.

                            BERNIE
                  Now water upstairs?? It's in the
                  walls.

      Ember and Wade peer through a window. They watch as Bernie
      rips away a piece of wall revealing a leaking pipe.

                            BERNIE
                  I don't understand! I fix one pipe
                  and another one leaks!

      Bernie pushes the Blue Flame away from the leak.

                               BERNIE
                  Ah, water!

      Bernie throws open the window. Coughing and letting smoke
      out. Ember and Wade plaster themselves to the wall. Bernie
      leaves the window.

                            EMBER
                       (whispered)
                  How could it be worse?

                            WADE
                  Now that water's back, the pressure
                  is forcing it up to ALL your pipes.

                            EMBER
                  We gotta find the source!

      They crouch down and peer into the basement.

                            EMBER
                  How did you even end up here?

      We follow a pipe going from the shop to the culvert and into
      the floor of the canal.

                            WADE
                  Well, I was in the canals checking
                  the doors for leaks...


      EXT. CULVERT WORKSITE - FLASHBACK - DAY

      Wade, wearing a hard hat, stands near CULVERT DOORS, and a
      LARGE PUDDLE.

                            WADE (V.O.)
                  When I found some water that
                  shouldn't have been there...

      He dips his finger in the puddle and tastes the water...

                            WADE
                       (smacks lips)
                  ...rusty, with a hint of-- motor
                  oil?

      SUDDENLY there is a RUSH of water. Wade is SWEPT OFF HIS FEET
      and SUCKED into a drain.

                            WADE (V.O.)
                  There was this WHOOSH of water.

                              WADE
                  AHHHH!

                            WADE (V.O.)
                  And I got sucked into a filtering
                  system...

      Wade is knocked around a filtering system.

                              WADE
                  Help!

      THEN BAM! He's JAMMED into a pipe that's clogged with DEBRIS.

                            WADE (V.O.)
                  But then I heard this explosion...

                                                                   52.


      SUDDENLY there's the VIBRATION that shook the pipe when Ember
      exploded.

                              EMBER (O.S.)
                  AHHHHHH!

      Wade's eyes grow in terror as he ALSO vibrates. The debris
      breaks up and FOOMP he's sucked in.

                              WADE
                  AHHHH!

      On Wade's face as he bursts out of a pipe. Behind him we see,
      through the distortion of the water, a blurry Ember...

                            WADE (O.S.)
                  That's how I ended up at your
                  place.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Ember and Wade are where we left them.

                            EMBER
                       (dawning)
                  Oh flame, my temper caused this.

      Ember looks down the seemingly endless canals.

                            EMBER
                       (overwhelmed by the odds)
                  So we're searching for water
                  "somewhere" in a canal?? Those
                  canals go EVERYWHERE.

                            WADE
                  It's why tracking down that leak
                  has been so dang hard.

                            EMBER
                       (gets an idea)
                  The roof.

                                                   CUT TO:


      EXT. ROOF OF BERNIE'S SHOP - SHORTLY AFTER

      Ember pulls a tarp off of the roof. Then, she melts a LARGE
      old chimney SMOKE CAP off it's stand. It topples over, almost
      hitting Wade. She attaches the tarp to the upside down smoke
      cap.

                            EMBER
                  You might want to step back.

      She climbs into the cap and flares up super bright and hot.
      The tarp inflates like a hot air balloon. Wade is astonished.

                            WADE
                  Holy dew drop!

                            EMBER
                  Shh. Get in.

      Wade scurries and climbs in as it starts to RISE. He stares
      at Ember with WONDER.

      They float above the rooftops of Firetown. It's gorgeous.
      Wade admires Ember's blaze. They're so close, his arm starts
      to boil. He takes a step away from her.

      We see the spot he was sucked in, there's a puddle.

                            WADE
                  Okay that's where I got sucked in.

      The camera PANS up the canal, following a trail of puddles.

                            WADE
                  More water. Go that way!

      Ember turns the balloon to follow the puddles. They pass a
      building... we hear giggles.

                            EARTH PRUNER 1
                       (giggle)
                  Right there.

      As they pass a darkened window, Ember's light illuminates two
      EARTH ELEMENTS picking each other's fruit. They FREEZE,
      caught.

                             EARTH PRUNER 2
                        (giggle)
                  Oh!

                            EARTH PRUNER 1
                  Nothing weird going on here.

                            EARTH PRUNER 2
                  Uh, just a little pruning.

      Wade and Ember stare as they float away. After a beat they
      turn to each other and burst out laughing.

                                                                54.


      A moment of connection. Wade looks at Ember's amazing fire.
      She catches him, her light refracting in his water.

                            WADE
                  So, uh, what do you do at the shop
                  if you don't mind me asking?

                            EMBER
                  My dad's retiring and I'll be
                  taking over. Some day, when I'm
                  ready.

      They float past glittering skyscrapers.

                            WADE
                  It must be nice        knowing what you're
                  gonna do. After        my dad passed I got
                  all "what's the        point?" Now I just
                  go from one job        to the next.

      Ember gives him a sympathetic look.

                            EMBER
                  There's a word in Firish. T�sh�k'.
                  It means embrace the light while it
                  burns, cause it won't always last
                  forever.

      Wade processes and tries to repeat it.

                            WADE
                       (quietly butchers it)
                  Tee shook...

                            EMBER
                       (small smile, he's way
                       off)
                  Or something like that.

      BUT, just then, they round a large building revealing an
      older section of town. Ember sees a large, ornate but rundown
      building. Her face drops. Wade see it.

                                 WADE
                  You okay?

                                 EMBER
                          (no)
                  Yeah.

                                 WADE
                  You sure?

      She decides to open up, and points to the building.

                            EMBER
                  It's just... that building over
                  there? That's Garden Central
                  Station.


      EXT. GARDEN CENTRAL STATION - FLASHBACK - DAY

      We GO TO a FLASHBACK of GARDEN CENTRAL STATION. There's a big
      SIGN advertising a Vivisteria Tree -- a rare and exotic
      plant. YOUNG EMBER, holding BERNIE'S hand, excitedly runs up
      to the entrance.

                            EMBER (V.O.)
                  When I was a kid, my dad took me
                  there because they had a VIVISTERIA
                  tree. I'd ALWAYS wanted to see one.
                  It's the only flower that can
                  thrive in ANY environment. Fire
                  included.

      They get in line with other ELEMENTS, eager for the exhibit.

                            EMBER (V.O.)
                  I was so excited.

      They approach the doors. But before they enter a GUARD stops
      them.

                            EMBER (V.O.)
                  But they said our Fire was too
                  dangerous and they wouldn't let us
                  in.

      The guard points to a "NO FIRE ALLOWED" SIGN. Bernie is
      FURIOUS. He yells and the guard yells back.

                            BERNIE
                  Tsh'� ts' sh� sh pf�kh!

                            GUARD
                  Go back to Fire Land!

      EVERYBODY laughs. Some jeer.

                             MUSEUM GOERS
                        (laughing, jeering)
                  Burn somewhere else! / Get outta
                  here!

                            EMBER (V.O.)
                  My dad was so angry, and
                  embarrassed.

      CLOSE UP: Young Ember scared.


      INT. HOT AIR BALLOON - BACK TO SCENE

      Ember and Wade are where we left them. We're close on Ember,
      her eyes burning with anger at the memory.

                            EMBER
                  The building flooded a few years
                  later. So I missed my one chance to
                  see a Vivisteria.

      She turns to Wade. And to her surprise, he's tearing up.

                            WADE
                  You must have been SO scared.

      This takes Ember back, and momentarily disarms her. Almost as
      a kid she says:

                            EMBER
                       (softly)
                  I was.

      THEN, she shakes it off, almost annoyed and amazed.

                            EMBER
                  How do you do that?

                              WADE
                  Do what?

                            EMBER
                  Draw people in! You got a whole
                  stadium to connect with you. I-- I
                  can't even connect with ONE
                  customer. My stupid temper always
                  kicks in.

                            WADE
                  I guess I just say what I feel.

      Ember deflates --this does not resonate at all.

                            WADE
                  And I don't think a temper is so
                  bad. Sometimes when I lose MY
                  temper... I think it's just ME
                  trying to tell me something I'm not
                  ready to hear.

                            EMBER
                  That's ridiculous.


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                   57.


                              WADE
                  Maybe...

      Suddenly Wade sees something! His eyes GROW with excitement.
      He points!

                            WADE
                  Hey, there! Put us down there!


      EXT. CULVERT - SHORTLY AFTER

      They land in the culvert and climb out and approach two GIANT
      WOODEN CULVERT DOORS that are broken and ajar. There's a
      gaping hole where they should meet.

                            WADE
                  That's not right.

      Wade dips his finger in some standing water and tastes it.

                             WADE
                  Motor oil!
                       (then chipper)
                  Yup, this is the source!

      They walk through the doors to investigate and head toward
      the main canal.

                            EMBER
                  Why's there no water?

                            WADE
                  Because the doors are broken. This
                  is supposed to catch spillover from
                  those main canals and--

      Just then a giant cruise-liner rolls by and it's wake
      triggers a small tsunami over the canal walls.

                            WADE
                  --RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!

      Ember and Wade run toward the culvert doors. Ember jumps
      through and climbs the door to RELATIVE safety, but Wade is
      caught on the other side, holding desperately to a broken
      part of the door.

                            WADE
                  Ahhhh! Help! Ahhhh!!!

      Thinking fast, Ember melts a piece of rebar off the door.

                                                                   58.


                               EMBER
                  Uh...

      She thrusts it toward him.

                               EMBER
                  Grab this!

      With great effort, Ember pulls Wade to safety.

      She looks at where the water is headed -- in the distance we
      can see the smoky tops of Firetown's buildings.

                            EMBER
                       (to herself)
                  Firetown!

      She spots a pile of SANDBAGS on the raised edge of the canal.
      Without hesitation she leaps over the water and climbs to the
      bags, grabs one and calls out to Wade:

                               EMBER
                  Catch!!

      She swings the sandbag and throws it down to him.

      Wade turns just as the bag arrives BAM, knocking him to the
      ground. He gets up and, moving against the flow of water,
      carries the sandbag toward the doors. Ember lifts another.

      Water is still pouring through the gates. Ember stops to
      watch Wade. He holds a sand bag under one arm and uses his
      free arm to press against the deluge. His body undulates and
      he starts to grow in size as water fills him up! With super
      strength, he pushes back the flow.

      Ember watches from above, impressed. Wade heaves the sand bag
      at the base of the door opening. He's now ENORMOUS,
      waterlogged but powerful. He calls up to Ember.

                            WADE
                  Ember! Throw me more!

      They start to pile more sandbags. Ember throwing them down
      and Wade stacking them up.

      When the pile is high and the water stopped, they place the
      last bag together.

      They finish... Ember, looks at the sandbags, concerned.

                            EMBER
                  So, will this hold?

      Wade pushes against the bags, testing the strength.

                              WADE
                  Yup.

      He turns to Ember. We see he has a clump of sand in his face.
      She can't help but look at it as he talks:

                             WADE
                  It should for sure. At least long
                  enough for me to get a city crew to
                  fix it before Friday.
                        (sees she's staring)
                  What?

                            EMBER
                  You've got a little... sand.

      Wade touches his face.

                            WADE
                  Oh. Here? Here?

      Ember points and reaches toward him, she almost touches his
      cheek.

                            EMBER
                  It's.. right there.

      Ember pulls her hand away.

                              EMBER
                  Um...

      Wade reaches into his face and pulls it out.

                            WADE
                  Oh. Thanks.

      They keep eye contact. It's almost intimate. Ember breaks
      away from it.

                            EMBER
                  Well... let me know when it's done
                  I guess.

                            WADE
                  I'll make sure there's a city crew
                  here by Friday.

                            EMBER
                  Okay, see ya.

      She turns and starts to walk off. Wade blurts out after:

                              WADE
                  Wait!

      Ember turns back.

                            WADE
                  Any chance you're free tomorrow? To
                  hang out with a Water guy?

                             EMBER
                  With a Water guy? My dad would boil
                  you alive.

                            WADE
                  He doesn't have to know! We could
                  meet in the city. I promise nothing
                  weird... maybe a little pruning?

                            EMBER
                  Sorry. That's not going to happen.

      ON Ember as Wade, hopeful, watches her walk out of frame.

                            WADE
                  You smiled! I saw it! Tomorrow!
                  I'll be at the Alkali Theater.
                  Three o'clock!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - NEXT AFTERNOON

      Flarry and Flarrietta sit at their regular table, playing
      Fire chess. Suddenly a drip of water falls from a pipe into
      Flarry's mug. They react:

                            FLARRY
                  Oh! Your ceiling is dripping again.

      Bernie GRUMBLES.

                            BERNIE
                  More leaks?

      Ember hurries over and gets on the table to melts the pipe
      shut.

                            EMBER
                  Don't worry. This whole problem is
                  going away. I can feel it.

      She then sees the CLOCK, it's 3:00. She hops off the table.

                            EMBER
                  And since we're all good, I am also
                  going away... to do deliveries!

      Bernie smiles as Ember rushes out. She passes Cinder on the
      way. INSTANTLY Cinder starts sniffing the air.

                            CINDER
                  Do I smell something on... EMBER??

      She smiles HUGE.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember hurries out the door, checks to make sure nobody is
      following her, then turns to find herself face to face with
      Clod.

                              CLOD
                  Yo Ember!

      She jumps, startled, busted.

                              EMBER
                  Ah! Clod!

                            CLOD
                  I grew another one...

      He lifts his arm and, with great effort, a tiny flower pops
      out.

                              CLOD
                  Ow!

      He picks the bud and offers it to Ember.

                              CLOD
                  My queen.

      She touches the flower -- POOF!

                            EMBER
                  Oops, sorry! But, gotta go.

      She hurries off.

      BEGIN MONTAGE that spans several days:




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                  62.


      EXT. ELEMENT CITY - ALKALI THEATER

      Wade waits for Ember outside the movie theater. The marquis
      says "TIDE & PREJUDICE." Wade lights up when he sees Ember
      coming. Overwhelmed, he starts to get teary. Ember cringes a
      bit. He pulls it together and they head in.


      INT. ALKALI THEATER

      Ember and Wade are in their seats. When the lights dim, the
      rest of the audience scowls at Ember's glow. She tightens her
      hood and sinks low in her seat.


      EXT. ELEMENT CITY STREET - PHOTO BOOTH

      Wade and Ember stop at a photo booth. They take a series of
      photos. When the prints come out we see Ember's light has
      completely blown out the exposure. All we can make out is two
      sets of eyeballs.


      INT. ELEMENT CITY BUILDING - ELEVATOR

      Wade and Ember board an elevator. As other passengers get on,
      they're forced closer and closer together. The doors close.
      As the elevator goes up, they're almost touching. Wade starts
      to bubble a little.


      INT. OBSERVATION DECK - CONTINUOUS

      They exit the elevator to an observation deck and look out on
      the city. A group of kids comes up next to them-- they are a
      little nervous about her fire. Ember blows smoke rings that
      become silly faces on the nearby buildings. The kids cheer
      and Ember takes a bow. Wade watches adoringly. When Ember
      looks back at him, he tries to play it cool.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - DAY

      Ember is at the counter with an open notebook, drawing sign
      ideas. Lifting the book, she steals a peek at the photo strip
      of her and Wade. The Sparkler Customer steps up to the
      counter and lights a sparkler before buying it. Ember grabs
      the sparkler from him and begins to roil. But she quickly
      composes herself with a breath and calmly hands the sparkler
      back to the customer.

      As she looks down to steal a look at the picture of Wade,
      Bernie walks up, startling her.

                                                                   63.


      He almost caught her looking at the photo but she covers it
      up with a smile. When he walks away, Ember sighs with relief.

      Ember crosses off. Cinder darts into frame and sniffs.

      She then lifts Ember's book and looks at the picture,
      excited, intrigued.

                            CINDER
                  Who IS this guy??


      EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

      Ember and Wade sit at a outdoor cafe in a courtyard. A WAITER
      drops off two large mugs full of PINK LIQUID. Wade downs his
      in one gulp and turns purple. Ember goes to drink hers, but
      the drink boils away before it hits her mouth. Wade laughs.

      Suddenly, people around them start dancing. It's a FLASH MOB!
      Wade pops up and starts bouncing his stomach to the music. He
      gets Ember to join him in the dance. Other dancers start
      coupling off. Wade extends his hand to Ember. Ember backs
      away. She wants to take it, but knows she can't. Another
      dancer knocks Wade backward into the base of a fountain. He
      reappears spouting out the top. He strikes an elegant pose.
      Ember smiles.

      END MONTAGE


      EXT. MINERAL LAKE - DAY

      Ember and Wade walk around MINERAL LAKE. Crystals of minerals
      grow along the shore. Suddenly, Ember's flame turns GREEN.

                              WADE
                  Whoa.

      Pan down to reveal she's standing on a crystal.

                            WADE
                  How'd you do that?

      She picks up a crystal.

                            EMBER
                  It's the minerals.
                       (then)
                  Check this out.

      Showing off, she twirls onto another crystal and her flame
      turns PINK.

                              WADE
                  Awesome!

      Ember runs along the shore. Hopping between crystals, her
      fire changing into all the colors of the rainbow.

                              WADE
                  Wow.

      Smitten and wanting to share, Wade glances toward the water.

                            WADE
                  Watch this!

      He runs onto the surface of the lake and then skids spraying
      a fine mist into the air, creating a rainbow. He comes to a
      stop, standing in the water. She looks at him, aglow.


      EXT. FIRETOWN - EVENING

      Ember, deep in thought and glowing from the dates, walks
      under the elevated train which whizzes by creating a wall of
      water. She reaches out to touch it... could she? Is it
      possible?

      But she hesitates. The wall of water dissipates, revealing
      the shop. It's like reality interjecting in the moment. Ember
      heads to the shop.


      EXT. CULVERT - THE NEXT DAY

      Water trickles through the sandbags. Then a gush, as more
      water pours through and heads to Firetown. Clearly the bags
      didn't hold.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - LATER

      A steady stream of water runs through the culvert outside the
      shop.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      Bernie struggles to make coal nuts.

      He turns to see Ember helping a customer with a smile on her
      face.

                            FIRISH CUSTOMER
                  S�b� sh sf�.

                                                                   65.


                              EMBER
                  Another?

                              FIRISH CUSTOMER
                  �shksh�.

      Ember reaches for a bottle on the top shelf but suddenly
      there's a RUMBLE and the shop shakes.

      An exposed pipe bursts. Water shoots out toward the Blue
      Flame. Bernie and Ember spring into action.

                            EMBER
                  No no no no no no!

                            BERNIE
                  The water is back?!

      They hurry to move the Blue Flame. Bernie starts to cough.

      Ember runs to melt the pipe together when we hear from O.S...

                            DELIVERY PERSON (O.S.)
                  Ember Lumen? Delivery for Ember
                  Lumen?

      A DELIVERY PERSON enters with SIX VASES of flowers. And ine
      one of the vases Ember sees TWO EYES! Oh no! It's Wade!

      Cinder is so giddy some guy has sent Ember flowers, she
      doesn't notice the eyes.

                            CINDER
                  Flowers for Ember?

      Ember quickly finishes repairing the pipe. She runs over to
      collect the flowers before anyone notices.

                             EMBER
                        (rushing)
                  Oh excuse me. Hehe, these are
                  beautiful. I'm gonna go put these
                  away.

      Arms full, she kicks open the basement door and darts into
      the basement...


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

      ...where she puts the vases on the floor. She hisses at Wade:

                            EMBER
                  What are you doing here?


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                   66.


      As Wade explains, he pours the water from the other vases
      into his head. With each pour he grows taller and reforms.

                            WADE
                  I got bad news. The sand bags
                  didn't hold.

                            EMBER
                  Uh, obviously!

                            WADE
                  Yeah. And I also got worse news.

      Almost back to form, he pulls his shirt into place and plucks
      flowers out of his head.

                            WADE
                  I'd forgotten a TINY detail about
                  the last time I saw that city crew.


      INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - FLASHBACK - DAY

      Wade is being scolded by his Earth Element EX-BOSS:

                            EX-BOSS
                  You knocked over three tons of
                  cement dust. Half the guys still
                  haven't recovered...

      REVEAL a group of angry WATER CONSTRUCTION WORKERS covered in
      cement, frozen like statues. All they can do is blink.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Ember and Wade are where we left them.

                            WADE
                  ...I guess you could say they still
                  have HARD feelings. Heh heh.
                  Because they won't help us.

                            EMBER
                  Wade, Gale's deadline is tomorrow.
                  We need more sandbags.

                            WADE
                  But that didn't work before.

                            EMBER
                  Well I can't just do NOTHING!!




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                67.


      JUST THEN the basement door opens. It's Bernie, coming down
      the stairs.

                            BERNIE
                  Ember, did you fix leak?

      Bernie sees Wade.

                            BERNIE
                  Huh? It's you again!!

                               WADE
                  Who, me?

                            BERNIE
                  You're guy who started all this!

      Bernie grabs a poker and swings at Wade.

                               WADE
                          (high pitched yell)
                  Ahhh!

                            EMBER
                  No, dad! Different guy. Not all
                  water looks alike.

                            BERNIE
                       (sees Wades badge)
                  You are city inspector?

                               WADE
                  Uhh-

                               EMBER
                  No!
                       (prompting Wade)
                  Right??

                            WADE
                  Right. I am not an inspector.

      Wade puts his hand over his badge, but his water MAGNIFIES
      the word "INSPECTOR." He tries again putting his other hand
      on top but it just magnifies the word even bigger.

                            BERNIE
                  You ARE inspector. Why you poking
                  around? Is this because of water
                  leak?

                            EMBER
                  No! Not because of water in ANY
                  way.

                            EMBER
                  He's a different kind of inspector.
                  Right??

                            WADE
                  Yeah, yeah... I'm a... I'm a...
                  FOOD inspector. I've come to
                  inspect your food.

                               BERNIE
                          (annoyed, suspicious)
                  Hmmm.
                        (sotto to Ember)
                  I think he's lying through his
                  feet.

                            EMBER
                       (correcting him)
                  Teeth.

                            BERNIE
                  Whatever!
                       (to Wade)
                  Food upstairs. Come.

      Bernie walks out. Ember shoots Wade a look.

                            EMBER
                       (hissing)
                  Food inspector??

                            WADE
                  I panicked!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - RIGHT AFTER

      Bernie stands behind the counter, eyeing Wade on the other
      side.

                            BERNIE
                  You really food inspector?

                            WADE
                  As far as you know, yeah.

      Bernie SLAMS a plate of burning kol-nuts on the counter in
      front of Wade. Wade gulps.

                            BERNIE
                  Then inspect THIS.

                               EMBER
                  Dad...

                                                                   69.


                            BERNIE
                  �... sh�tsh.

      Wade leans over the plate and quickly sniffs.

                            WADE
                  Yep, all looks good to me.

                            BERNIE
                  No no no no. Inspect with your
                  mouth.

      Bernie takes a big bite and blows fire.

      Wade, terrified, scoops a kol-nut into a spoon and
      reluctantly brings it to his mouth. He blows on it, then
      takes his first flaming bite-- it sizzles all the way down
      his throat.

      Flarry, Flarrietta and other customers watch, holding their
      breath.

      The coal reaches his belly. Suddenly, Wade screams in pain.
      He quickly clamps his hands over his mouth to cover. But a
      giant bubble grows in his body and rises to his head and
      floats out of his mouth.

      The bubble floats across the shop and hits Bernie in the
      head. It POPS:

                            WADE
                  AHHHHHHHHHHH!

      Ember tries to cover.

                            EMBER
                  You see? He likes it.

      Wade coughs, miserable, but smiles and gives a thumbs up.

                             BERNIE
                  You must try these. Straight from
                  Fire Land.

      Bernie pours a pile of coals onto Wade's plate. Ember
      realizes what her dad is up to.

                            EMBER
                  Dad. Those are too hot.

                            WADE
                       (croaks)
                  I'm okay. I love hot food.

                                                                   70.


      Wade's in too deep. He takes another bite of flaming coals.

      His head quickly fills with huge air bubbles that immediately
      POP out of his face and force him backwards. He falls into
      shelf, spilling water all over the shop.

                            BERNIE
                  Hey! Watch your water!
                       (then)
                  So, did we pass?

                            WADE
                  Mmmhmmm. A-plus.
                       (tastes his mouth, then)
                  Actually... After the heat dies
                  down, that's really good.
                       (has an idea)
                  If you don't mind...

      Wade grabs a mug and scoops up more kol-nuts. He then drips
      water on top of them with his finger. The coals go out with a
      HISS.

      Ember realizes what Wade is doing and tries to get his
      attention and wave him off.

                            EMBER
                  Mmmm mmmmm!

      Bernie watches, getting increasingly annoyed. Wade drinks.

                            WADE
                       (lip smacks)
                  See, it's really tasty if you water
                  it down a little--

      Bad choice of words, Bernie EXPLODES.

                            BERNIE
                  Water us down? Water us down?!!
                  Where's camera?!

      Bernie pulls out a camera and snaps a photo of Wade's
      terrified face.

                            BERNIE
                  We will NEVER be watered down by
                  you. Get out!!

      Ember hurries out from behind the counter.

                            EMBER
                  Alright, sir. You gotta go.

                                                                  71.


      Wade sets the mug down and rushes for the exit.

      Bernie huffs and swears in Firish.

                            BERNIE
                  �sh � k'�� p�?!

                            EMBER
                  Dad, don't worry. I've got this.

                            BERNIE
                  Khshkff f� �kht' sh�b� ��!

      Ember runs out after Wade.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR, Ember catches Wade:

                            EMBER
                       (with resolve)
                  Look, meet me at the beach and
                  we'll make more sandbags. We have
                  to figure out how to fix those
                  doors.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      BACK INSIDE THE SHOP, Ember finds Bernie still seething.

                            BERNIE
                  Water want to water us down? Then
                  water no longer allowed in shop!

      He slams Wade's photo onto the wall under a sign, "BANNED."

                            BERNIE
                  He is panned!

                            EMBER
                       (correcting him)
                  Um... banned.

                              BERNIE
                  Banned!

      Agitated, he starts coughing dark smoke. It's the WORST
      COUGHING FIT we've seen from him to date. Ember rushes to
      comfort him.

                                                                  72.


                            EMBER
                  �shf�, it's okay. It's all going to
                  be okay.

      Ember, not so sure it's going to be okay, looks at Wade's
      photo, concerned.


      EXT. BEACH - SUNSET

      On the beach, the sun sets over the water. Ember shovels sand
      while Wade holds the bag open.

                            WADE
                  I don't think this is going to
                  work.

                            EMBER
                  Well it won't unless you hold the
                  bag straight.

                            WADE
                  Maybe your dad will understand.

      Ember SCOFFS and keeps shoveling.

                            WADE
                  I'm serious. Look, I know it can be
                  tough. I mean with my dad... we
                  were like oil and water.
                       (deep regret)
                  I never got a chance to fix that.
                       (then)
                  But you guys are different. It
                  might be time to tell him.

                            EMBER
                       (increasing intensity)
                  Yeah, right. And tell him what??
                  That I got us shut down and
                  DESTROYED HIS DREAM??

      On "dream" she FLARES PURPLE, melts the shovel and lets out a
      yell. Then collapses to her knees, distraught, her shields
      down.

      Her fire slows down and dims to a candlelight, soft, gentle.
      It's like we're seeing her INNER light... the same light from
      when she was vulnerable in front of city hall. Caustics
      reflect around her.

      And then the truth:

                                                                 73.


                            EMBER
                  I think I'm failing.
                       (then)
                  My �shf� should have retired YEARS
                  ago but he doesn't think I'm ready.
                  You have no idea how hard they've
                  worked or what they've had to
                  endure, the family they left
                  behind...
                       (beat, her big question)
                  How do you repay a sacrifice that
                  big? It all feels like a burden...
                  How can I say that?

      She hangs her head.

                            EMBER
                  I'm a bad daughter.

                            WADE
                  Hey, no. You're doing your best.

      She shakes this off, not ready to go deeper, then gets
      uncomfortable with the fragility she is showing Wade.

                            EMBER
                       (sniff)
                  I'm a mess.

      She tries to collect herself and blaze up to cover her
      vulnerable light, but before she can:

                             WADE
                  Nah, I think you're even more
                  beautiful.

      Ember smiles back at him, her flame growing bright again. She
      looks out at the ocean, the sun meets the horizon.

                             EMBER
                  Maybe you're right when you said my
                  temper is me trying to tell me
                  something.

      Wade notices where Ember is sitting, the sand is molten.

                            WADE
                  Whoa, look what your fire did to
                  the sand. It's glass.

      Ember breaks off a piece of the glass, melting it in her
      hands. She forms it into a sphere and uses her fire to create
      a design inside, what she feels -- a fragile Vivisteria
      flower.

      WADE WATCHES mesmerized.

                            WADE
                  It looks like a Vivisteria flower.

      SUDDENLY Ember has a realization.

                            EMBER
                  I know how to seal those doors.

      She hops up and runs off, leaving the glass Vivisteria in the
      sand.


      EXT. CULVERT - LATER THAT NIGHT

      It's dark. Ember takes a deep breath and then puts her hand
      on the stack of sand bags holding the doors shut.

      There's an EXPLOSION of LIGHT and GLASS as Ember melts the
      sand bags and begins to seal the culvert door the newly
      created glass. But this is unlike anything we've seen from
      her... she's joyous, OWNING the experience... it's almost
      like watching a dance or someone paint with passion. She
      seems free and alive and is GLOWING with JOY... and her light
      is vulnerable, beautiful.

      Wade can't help but try to take it all in -- the glass, the
      caustics, her light.

                              EMBER
                  Yes!

      When she finishes, she and Wade stand back and admire her
      work. Ember is out of breath but her light is peaceful.

      Wade bites his lip trying hard not to cry.

                            EMBER
                       (scoff)
                  Are you crying?

                            WADE
                  Yes. I've just never been punched
                  in the face with beauty before.

      They share a moment. Suddenly the earth VIBRATES.

      An enormous boat passes through the canal, sending sheets of
      water into the culvert.

      They look to the glass as water RUSHES in... they're poised
      to run, and take a couple steps back. But the glass holds.

                                                                   75.


      It SPLASHES, then settles, only filling the very bottom of
      the culvert behind the doors.

                               EMBER
                  It worked!

                            WADE
                  I'll have Gale come by right after
                  work. I'll let you know the second
                  I hear anything.

                            EMBER
                  You think this'll be good enough
                  for her?

                            WADE
                  Honestly?
                       (concerned)
                  It's hard to know. She could go
                  either way.

      Ember nods, nervous. Wade takes something out of his pocket.

                            WADE
                       (remembering)
                  Oh. Here... I saved this for you.

      He hands her the glass Vivisteria. Ember takes it in her
      hand.

                            WADE
                  It's special.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - THE NEXT EVENING

      Shimmering rays of light spill out of an upstairs window.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - EMBER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      And we see the light's source: Ember sits on her bed,
      secretly looking at the glass Vivisteria. Her light refracts
      through it and dances on the walls.

      Suddenly, she hears Bernie coughing downstairs. She quickly
      gets up.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - RIGHT AFTER

      Ember runs down the stairs to see Bernie repairing a water-
      damaged wall. He's exhausted.



�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                76.


                            EMBER
                  �shf�, you okay?

      He sees her and smiles.

                            BERNIE
                  Yes. Yes. Just too much to fix.

      Ember pulls over a metal can and sits.

                            EMBER
                  I'll take care of it. YOU need to
                  rest. And that's an order.

      Bernie salutes.

                            BERNIE
                  Yes, ma'am.

      They share a laugh. Then Bernie sits and takes his daughter's
      hands in his own. This is a big moment for him.

                            BERNIE
                  Ember, I see a change in you.
                  Happier. Calmer with customers, and
                  with that...
                       (with disgust)
                  ...food inspector.

      He gestures to PHOTO of Wade on the "BANNED!" board.

                            BERNIE
                  Always putting shop first. You
                  prove I can trust you.

      They stand and Bernie heads for the stairs. He stops to
      cough, then turns back to Ember.

                            BERNIE
                  I'm so lucky I have you.

      He goes upstairs. Ember smiles lovingly. All she wants is to
      please him. Then her face falls. She pulls out the "going out
      of business" flyer from Fern, then turns to the picture of
      Wade on the board. SUDDENLY:


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CINDER'S MATCHMAKING OFFICE

      Dozing Cinder suddenly sits BOLT UPRIGHT and sniffs.

                              CINDER
                  Love!

      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - LATER

      Ember gently closes the shop door and sneaks to her scooter
      and drives off, quietly. JUST THEN, Cinder exits the shop,
      sniffing. Her eyes dart around, suspicious.

      She turns in the direction Ember rode off and follows the
      scent.


      EXT. WATER DISTRICT - WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Ember parks her scooter and approaches the entrance to a
      tall, waterfall covered apartment building. She gulps at the
      splendor.

      As she approaches a WATER DOORMAN, Wade shows up and opens
      the door. He's THRILLED to see her.

                            WADE
                  Ember! You found it! Everything ok?

                            EMBER
                  Please tell me that you have some
                  good news from Gale.

                            EMBER
                  I'm getting really worried about my
                  dad. This has to break my way.

                            WADE
                  Yeah, I haven't heard from her yet,
                  but she SWORE she'd call tonight.
                       (then)
                  Actually, my family stopped by for
                  dinner? You, want to come up and
                  wait for the call together?

      Ember pauses. Meet the family? That feels like a new step...

                            EMBER
                  Your family?

      AROUND THE CORNER, unseen by Wade and Ember, Cinder sniffs,
      still tracking Ember's trail.

      She suddenly stops in her tracks. She sees Ember talking to
      SOMEBODY -- but from her POV, she can't see who.

                            EMBER
                  Um... okay, I'll come up for a bit.

      Cinder ducks, peering over a ledge.

      BACK WITH Ember and Wade: the DOORMAN opens the front door
      and tips his hat. It's pretty ritzy.

                            EMBER
                  I'm sorry... You LIVE here?

                            WADE
                  It's my mom's place.

                            EMBER
                  Oh my gosh.

      Wade and Ember enter. Hot on their tail, Cinder hurries up to
      the building and tries to enter. The Doorman blocks her path.

                            DOORMAN
                  I'm afraid I can't let you in.
                  Residents and guests only.

      Cinder pretends to leave, then suddenly does a spin dodge to
      get around the doorman, but he quickly extends him arm
      creating a wall of water.

                            CINDER
                  Ah, okay. I under-STAND.

      Cinder spins again in the other direction, but the Doorman
      creates a second wall of water with his other arm.

                            CINDER
                  You're surprisingly good at your
                  job!

                            DOORMAN
                  You're surprisingly fast for your
                  age.

                            CINDER
                  You have NO idea.

      Cinder suddenly spins her fire into a tornado! The Doorman
      gulps, concerned.


      INT. WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      The door is thrown open and Wade's mom, BROOK is there,
      gushing!

                            BROOK
                  Ember! Oh I'm so excited to finally
                  meet you.
                       (unsure)

                            BROOK (CONT'D)
                  Do we hug or... wave or... don't
                  want to put you out ha ha.

                            EMBER
                  Um, a hello is fine.

                            BROOK
                  Hardly. Wade hasn't stopped talking
                  about you since the day you met.
                  The boy is smitten!

                              WADE
                  Mom!

                            BROOK
                  Oh, come on. I'm your mother. I
                  know when something's "lighting you
                  up." I just didn't know she'd be so
                  SMOKEY!

      They all laugh. Ember stops sooner... not as funny to her. A
      beat.

                            BROOK
                  Come this way. Meet the rest of the
                  family.

      Ember starts to follow but is stopped in her tracks when she
      sees the apartment is one big swimming pool with floating
      furniture.

      Brook steps into the pool and Ember hangs behind. It's an
      awkward moment. But, thinking fast, Wade grabs a floaty chair
      from the side of the room, and then fetches a welcome mat
      from the foyer. He places the mat on the chair. Solution!

      Ember cautiously steps onto the floaty. Wade carefully guides
      Ember into the living room, when Brook remembers:

                            BROOK
                  Oh honey! You won't believe what
                  your baby niece did today! She...
                  she smiled.

      Brook starts to tear up which gets Wade going.

                            WADE
                  No, she didn't.

      She nods. They both burst into tears. Ember watches, wide-
      eyed. What has she gotten herself into??

      INT. WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - LATER

      Ember and Wade follow Brook through a waterfall curtain. Wade
      holds his arm above Ember to keep her dry.

      We reveal the rest of Wade's family gathered around an
      inflatable dining table. Everyone there is Water. Wade yells
      to the room.

                            WADE
                  Hey everyone! This is Ember!

      Everyone turns to them:

                              ALAN
                  Hey!

                            WADE
                  That's my brother Alan and his wife
                  Eddy.

                              EDDY
                  Hi!

                            ALAN
                  And we got two kids that are
                  swimming around here somewhere.
                       (calling out)
                  Marco! Polo!

      Two heads pops out of the water. One chases the other,
      slapping him with a pool noodle.

                            POLO
                  Hi Uncle Wade!

      Suddenly they see Ember. Whoa. They've never been this close
      to Fire.

                            MARCO
                  Do you die if you fall in water?

      Marco starts to shake Ember's floaty.

                              EMBER
                  Whoa!

      Wade is furious.

                              WADE
                  MARCO!

      Alan jumps in.

                            ALAN
                       (to Ember, embarrassed)
                  Kids. Heh he.
                       (dead serious)
                  Don't hate us.

      Alan pulls Marco off and ushers the kids away.

      Ember regains her balance and smiles uncomfortably. Wade,
      feeling bad, leads Ember and her floaty over to the dinner
      table.

                            WADE
                  Anyway... that's my little sib
                  Lake. And her girlfriend Ghibli.

                              GHIBLI
                  `Sup.

                            WADE
                  They're students at Element City
                  School For the Arts.

                            LAKE
                  Yeah, following in Mom's wake.

                            BROOK
                  Oh nonsense, I'm just an architect.
                  The real artist is my brother
                  Harold.

      Reveal HAROLD, standing in front of a very large painting.

                            HAROLD
                  Oh, I just dabble in water colors.
                       (dad joke)
                  Or as we like to call them,
                  "colors."

      He laughs at his own joke. Brook sets a dish down on the
      table and sits. As they talk, everyone takes a seat and the
      meal begins.

                            BROOK
                  Oh don't listen to him. He's a
                  wonderful painter. One of his
                  paintings just got in the Element
                  City Museum's permanent collection.

                            EMBER
                  Wow. That is so cool. My only
                  talent is "clean up on aisle 4!"

                            WADE
                  Talk about being modest-- Ember's
                  got an incredible creative flame!
                  I've never seen anything like it.

      Wade looks lovingly toward Ember. Harold jumps in.

                            HAROLD
                       (loud and slow)
                  I just have to say that you speak
                  SO well and clear--

      Wade shoots him a look. Ember keeps her cool.

                            EMBER
                  Hmph. Yeah, it's amazing what
                  talking in the same language your
                  entire life can do.

                              HAROLD
                         (embarrassed)
                  Doh!

      Alan tries to break the tension.

                            ALAN
                  Uh, hey Ember, did Wadey here ever
                  tell you that he's deathly afraid
                  of sponges?

                              EMBER
                         (intrigued)
                  No.

                                                   FLASHBACK:


      INT. KINDERGARTEN HALLWAY -        DAY

                            WADE (V.O.)
                  I was traumatized...

      A five-year-old Wade is walking down the school hallway when
      a janitor drops a large sponge. Curious Wade hangs back and
      tentatively pokes it.

      Wade reaches out and touches it with his finger-- it
      immediately starts to suck in his water. Panicking, he tries
      to pull away but the suction is too strong and it soaks him
      up entirely!




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                      83.


      Close on the sponge with little Wade's terrified eyes peering
      out.

                                                   BACK TO PRESENT:

      Everyone except Wade is cracking up, especially Ember.

                            BROOK
                  I still can't use a sponge around
                  him!

                            WADE
                  I was stuck in there for hours!

      As he laughs, Alan pours from a glass pitcher, but it slips
      out of his hand and SHATTERS.

                               ALAN
                  Oh!

                            BROOK
                  Alan! That was new!

      Ember quickly picks up a couple shards of glass and blows on
      them, melting them together.

                             ALAN
                  My bad. I'm all whirlpools
                  tonight...

                            EMBER
                  I can fix it.

      Without thinking, she gathers all of the pieces and heats
      them up, melting it into a glowing ball. She then blows into
      it, shaping it, working it.

      And we see her light grow vulnerable, prismatic, caustics
      shining, just like at the dam. She molds the glass into a
      gorgeous, colorful piece of art.

      She sets down the pitcher, lost in the moment, and doesn't
      notice that the whole family watching mesmerized. She looks
      up:

                               EMBER
                  Oh, uhm...

      Self-conscious, she ZIPS up her fire.

                               EMBER
                  Sorry.

                            HAROLD
                       (blown away)
                  That... was... incredible.

      The family explodes in applause. Ember tries to cover how
      flattered she is.

                            EMBER
                  It's just melted glass.

                            BROOK
                  Just melted glass? Every building
                  in the new city is built from "just
                  melted glass." Oh no, you have to
                  do something with that talent.

      Ember looks to the city through the floor to ceiling windows -
      - it's glistening with lights, glass... it's beautiful.

      Wade leans to her and whispers.

                            WADE
                  See, I told you you're special.

      She smiles. It's a lovely moment. Then Wade suddenly gets an
      idea! An actual bubble floats up through his head...

                            WADE
                       (gasp)
                  Ooh, thought bubble!

                            WADE
                  Maybe after dinner we play "The
                  Crying Game?"

      Everyone is thrilled with this suggestion. Ember smirks.

                            EMBER
                  Let me guess: you TRY to cry?

                            WADE
                  We try NOT to cry.


      INT. WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - SOON AFTER

      Everyone is gathered in the living room. It's game time. As
      Wade turns over an hourglass timer:

                            WADE
                  You have one minute. Go!

      Brook and Harold face off against each other.

                  1979. November. You were--

      Brook bursts into tears.

      Her team throws their hands up, the other team celebrates.
      Ember smiles, this is kinda fun.

                            BROOK
                       (bawling)
                  --Never got a chance to say goodbye
                  to Nana. Damn, you're good.

                            HAROLD
                  Okay, Ember, Wade, you're up.

      Ember and Wade face off.

                            EMBER
                  Yeah this is almost unfair. Because
                  I have literally never cried. You
                  got no chance.

                            WADE
                  Sounds like a challenge.

      As Harold flips the timer:

                               HAROLD
                  Ready, go!

                            WADE
                  Butterfly. Windshield wipers. Half
                  a butterfly.

      Everyone tears up. Ember is unmoved.

                            WADE
                  Okay. An old man on his deathbed.
                  Remembers the summer he fell in
                  love. She was out of his league and
                  he was young and scared.
                       (sniff, tearing up)
                  He let her go thinking surely
                  summer would come again.
                       (sniff)
                  It never did.

      Ember is still unmoved.

                            HAROLD
                       (sniffling)
                  Almost out of time.

      Wade smiles at Ember, then takes the plunge and be honest.
      This is no longer about the game, it's about telling her how
      he REALLY feels.

      As he speaks, his family leans in, captivated.

                            WADE
                  Ember, when I met you I thought I
                  was drowning. But that light, that
                  light inside you has made me feel
                  so alive. And all I want now is to
                  be near it. Near you. Together.

      We ZOOM close into Ember's eye. There is a small glimmering
      flame in her pupil... it becomes an impressionistic version
      of EMBER. She floats with WADE and they dance around each
      other... she sheds her outer light and we see her full
      vulnerable light as they spin. It's lovely. They reach out to
      touch hands, but Ember suddenly pulls back, the magic is
      broken. She falls away from him...

      PULL OUT and we see the same reflections on a LAVA TEAR DROP
      that drips out of Ember's eye, rolls down her cheek and into
      the pool.

      The entire family is caught up in the emotional connection
      Ember and Wade just made, stunned.

      Ember and Wade just stare into each other's eyes.

      And then, THE PHONE rings and the moment is broken. Wade
      rushes over to pick it up.

                            WADE
                       (into phone)
                  Hello? Gale, hi.

      Ember tries to read his expression.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      EXT. CULVERT - SAME TIME

      Gale and TWO AIR CITY WORKERS stand skeptically at the glass-
      repaired doors. Gale does not look happy.

                            GALE
                       (you idiots)
                  Glass?? You repaired it with
                  glass??

      Behind Gale an Air Worker punches the glass.

                                                                 87.


                            AIR WORKER
                       (efforts)
                  Hey hey!

                            GALE
                  Hold the storm...

      Wade swallows hard. Ember looks nervous.

      Gale watches as another worker slams the glass with a large
      hammer, the glass holds. The workers give her a thumbs up.

                             GALE
                  TEMPERED glass? Solid as a rock. I
                  like it. Consider the tickets
                  cancelled.

      Wade hangs up, smiling, teary eyed with joy. Ember can't
      believe it.

                            EMBER
                  We did it!?

                               WADE
                  Yup!

      Ember pulls the brochure out her pocket and triumphantly
      burns it.

                               WADE
                  Awesome!

      Wade runs toward her, arms outstretched.

                               WADE
                  Wooo!

      Ember opens her arms, they're about to hug but stop
      themselves.

                    EMBER                               WADE
      Oh! Um.                              Oh.
                                              (laugh)

     Suddenly, Polo pops up behind Wade and smacks him HARD with a
     pool noodle.

                               WADE
                          (pained)
                 Oh!

      INT. WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - SHORTLY AFTER

      LATER at the door, Brook says goodbye to Ember and Wade.
      Brook holds the repaired glass vase.

                            EMBER
                  Thank you Mrs. Ripple. This was...
                  this was really great.

                            BROOK
                  Yeah, it was. And I mean what I
                  said about your talent. I have a
                  friend who runs the best glass
                  making firm in the world. During
                  dinner, I slipped out and I made a
                  call. And I told her about you.
                  They're looking for an intern. It
                  could be an amazing opportunity.

                              EMBER
                  For real?

                            BROOK
                  It's a long way from the city, but
                  it would be an incredible start.
                  You have a bright future.
                       (then, re: vase)
                  Look at me! I have an original
                  Ember!

      Ember's expression falls. She smiles nervously and turns to
      go.

                            WADE
                  Hold up. I'll walk you out.

      Wade follows her out.


      EXT. WADE'S MOM'S APARTMENT - RIGHT AFTER

      The doorman, now a half-steamed water wall, but still holding
      strong, stands across from a still full-on-fire-tornado
      Cinder.

                            DOORMAN
                       (out of breath)
                  I'm afraid you're still going to
                  have to wait out here ma'am.

      Cinder's tornado slows to a stop. She tries to catch her
      breath, dizzy.

                                                                   89.


                            CINDER
                       (out of breath)
                  And I'm afraid... I will throw up.

      Cinder staggers away from the building to recover.

      Behind her, Wade rushes to catch up to Ember as she hurries
      to her scooter and hops on.

                            WADE
                  Ember! Ember, hold up. What's going
                  on?

                            EMBER
                  I can't believe she basically
                  offered me a job.

                            WADE
                  I know! Could be cool!

                            EMBER
                  Yeah, super cool, Wade! I could
                  move out and make glass in a far
                  away city. Do whatever I want.

                            WADE
                  I don't understand.

                            EMBER
                  I'm going home.

      She starts her scooter. Wade, unsure what else to do:

                            WADE
                  Fine, then I'm going with you.

      Wade hops on the back of the scooter.

                              EMBER
                  Ugh!

      Ember GUNS the scooter and zips into the night. Wade hangs on
      for dear life.

      ANGLE ON Cinder, she whips around just in time to see them
      drive off. She's SHOCKED:

                            CINDER
                  A WATER guy??


      EXT. BRIDGE

      ON EMBER AND WADE as they drive fast.

                                                                   90.


                            WADE
                       (yelling over the noise)
                  Look-- My mom was just trying to be
                  helpful! She doesn't know how
                  excited you are to run the shop!

                            EMBER
                       (frustrated)
                  Arrgh!!

      Ember guns it. They weave through traffic. The inertia and G-
      Forces stretch Wade out.

                            WADE
                  What is the matter??

                              EMBER
                  Nothing!

                            WADE
                  Yeah? Because we're going like a
                  thousand, and-- BUS!

      Ember SWERVES, Wade stretches from the force, splashing along
      the side of the bus.

                              WADE
                  Ah!

                            EMBER
                  You don't know me, Wade! Okay? So
                  stop pretending like you do.

      They speed toward Firetown.

                            WADE
                  What is this about?

                            EMBER
                  Nothing. Everything. I don't know.
                  It's...

      She SLAMS the brakes and SKIDS to a stop in front of the
      shop, the Blue Flame glowing from inside the dark windows.

                            EMBER
                  I don't think I actually DO want to
                  run the shop, okay? THAT'S what my
                  temper has been trying to tell
                  me... I'm trapped.

      She gets off the bike and faces the shop. Wade joins her.

                            EMBER
                       (looking at Flame)
                  You know what's crazy? Even when I
                  was a KID, I would pray to the Blue
                  Flame to be good enough to fill my
                  father's shoes someday. Because
                  this place is his dream. But I
                  never once asked... what I wanted
                  to do.
                       (sigh)
                  I think that's because deep down I
                  knew it didn't matter. Because the
                  only way to repay a sacrifice so
                  big is by sacrificing your life
                  too.

      Wade stares at Ember.

      SUDDENLY we hear:

                              CINDER
                  Ember!

      We see tiny, distant Cinder up on the train platform.

                            CINDER
                  Don't move!!

                            EMBER
                  Oh, blaze! My mother.

      Cinder hurries down the stairs and runs up to them, exhausted
      from the chase.

                            EMBER
                  Mom, it's okay. He's just a friend.

                              CINDER
                  Si--
                       (breathes heavy, finger
                       up, then)
                  SILENCE! I could smell you from
                  over there! You stink.

                            EMBER
                  What are you talking about??

                            CINDER
                  YOU know what I'm talking about!

      Ember sniffs herself.

                            EMBER
                  You're smelling love on me?

      Ember glances at Wade... is she... in love?

                            CINDER
                       (a warning)
                  If your father find out.
                       (then)
                  Fire and Water cannot be together!
                  I prove it! Come with me.

      Cinder goes into the shop, gesturing for them to follow.


      INT. CINDER'S MATCHMAKING OFFICE - SOON AFTER

      Ember and Wade sit across from Cinder, two sticks stand on
      the table between them.

                            CINDER
                  I splash this on your heart to
                  bring love to the surface!

      Cinder ANGRILY splashes Ember with oil. Then, she FURIOUSLY
      splashes Wade, leaving a little oil-slick. He flinches at
      first but then enjoys it.

                               WADE
                          (pleasant)
                  Mmmm.

      Cinder gestures to the sticks.

                            CINDER
                  And then you must light these with
                  your fire and I read the smoke.

      Ember sniffs herself. Then she lights a stick.

      Cinder turns to Wade and gestures smugly. His turn. He looks
      at his finger. No way to light the flame.

                            CINDER
                  See, Ember, it cannot be.

      Wade gets a thought.

                            WADE
                  Actually...

      He stands between Ember and the sticks.

                            EMBER
                       (sotto)
                  What are you doing?



�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

      He pulls up his shirt and refracts Ember's light through his
      torso, causing a magnifying glass effect. He focuses the beam
      of light onto the stick. And it works!

      The stick lights and starts smoking, surprising Cinder and
      Ember both.

      Everyone watches as the intermingling smoke turns into a
      double-helix. Cinder can't help but read the smoke.

      Ember watches her mom... could it actually tell them
      something? They are all caught up in the moment when suddenly
      we hear:

                            BERNIE (O.S.)
                  Cinder? Who down there?

      Ember's eyes grow in horror.

                            EMBER
                  It's my dad. You have to go!


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - RIGHT AFTER

      Cinder and Ember rush Wade out the front door just as Bernie
      enters from upstairs.

                            WADE
                  Wait, are we a match?

      Cinder SLAMS the door -- Wade's hand gets momentarily caught.

                              WADE
                  Ahhh!

      Bernie approaches from the other side of the shop, unaware.

                            BERNIE
                  What's going on? I wake up and
                  nobody upstairs??

      After a struggle, we hear Wade escape. Ember tries to cover:

                            EMBER
                  It was just me. I was... double
                  checking the locks. And mom came
                  down and...

                            CINDER
                  Yes and we...
                       (bad lying)
                  ...began looking at this door. We
                  don't talk about this door enough!

                            EMBER
                       (hissed, sotto)
                  Pull it together!

      Bernie smiles.

                            BERNIE
                  Well, since you are awake... I was
                  going to tell you tomorrow, but...
                  I'm too excited to sleep. In two
                  days... I retire!

                               EMBER
                  Oh!

                               CINDER
                  Oh Bernie!

                            EMBER
                       (this is shocking)
                  Two days?

                               BERNIE
                  Yes.

                            BERNIE
                  We're going to throw BIG party. A
                  grand reopening!

      Bernie takes Cinder by the hand and spins her.

                            BERNIE
                  That way I can tell whole world my
                  daughter take over.

      Cinder is overjoyed. Ember looks sick to her stomach.

                            BERNIE
                  And I have gift for you. I've had
                  this for awhile, but after our talk
                  I know now is the time.

      Bernie walks to the counter and pulls out a large box. He
      puts his hand on it and pauses, getting serious.

                            BERNIE
                  Before I give it to you, I need you
                  to understand what it means to me.


      EXT. FIRE LAND - SHORE - FLASHBACK

      We're back in Fire Land. A group of Fire Elements watch as
      two figures, Bernie and Cinder, walk toward a boat.


�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                   95.


                            BERNIE (V.O.)
                  When I left Fire Land, I gave my
                  father the "B� Ks�," the Big Bow.

      Bernie turns back toward his parents and does the CEREMONIAL
      Bow -- on his knees, arms outstretched.

                            BERNIE (V.O.)
                  It is the highest form of respect.
                  But my father did not return the
                  Bow, did not give me his blessing.

      A heartbroken Bernie, still in the bow, looks to his stoic
      father.

                            BERNIE (V.O.)
                  He say, if we leave Fire Land, we
                  will lose who we are.

      Bernie hangs his head.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Back to Bernie today, tears in his eyes. This is unresolved
      trauma.

                            BERNIE
                  They never got to see all of this.

      He gestures to the shop, to the shrine.

                            BERNIE
                  They didn't get to see that I NEVER
                  forgot we are Fire. This is burden
                  I still carry.

      Cinder wells up. Bernie is NEVER this open about his
      emotions.

                            BERNIE
                  Ember, it is important that you
                  know you have MY blessing every day
                  you come in here. So I have this
                  made for you.

      Bernie opens the large package: It's a neon sign for the shop
      that reads: EMBER'S FIREPLACE.

      Ember's eyes widen, stunned. Bernie beams with pride.

                            EMBER
                  Wow, �shf�.

                                                                  96.


      Bernie flares up, excited, full of YOUTHFUL energy.

                             BERNIE
                  It's gonna be big, bright! Everyone
                  is gonna see this. EMBER'S
                  FIREPLACE! We unveil it at grand
                  reopening!

                            CINDER
                  Come Bernie, you need your rest.

      Cinder leads Bernie away, but turns back and SHOOTS EMBER a
      look as they go.

      LATER, Ember sits on the floor, alone in the shop, staring at
      the sign, turning it on and off. Her flame dims and she
      quietly starts to cry.


      EXT. CULVERT - THE NEXT DAY

      A boat goes by and a WAVE of water spills into the culvert.
      We see that the glass dam still holds, but water is almost to
      the top, creating enormous PRESSURE. A TINY crack appears.


      INT. BROOK'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - THAT EVENING

      There's a knock on the door. Wade opens it and is thrilled to
      find:

                            WADE
                  Ember! So what'd your mom say?
                  About our reading?

      She's subdued, holding a box.

                            EMBER
                  Nothing. Look, I have a gift for
                  you.

      Wade steps out into the hall. Ember hands him the box. He
      reaches in and pulls out the Vivisteria glass.

                            WADE
                  And you came all the way here to
                  give it to me?
                       (then, realizing)
                  Wait, why are you giving me gifts?

      Ember looks away. Wade gets it. She's ending things.

                            WADE
                  Oh no. No, no, no, no no.

                                                                   97.


      But he gets an idea... bubble, glass, Vivisteria...

                            WADE
                  Hold on. I think I have something
                  to show you.
                       (energized, excited)
                  Just give me two seconds! And
                  you're going to need a pair of
                  boots!

      On Ember, puzzled.


      EXT. GARDEN CENTRAL STATION - SOON AFTER

      Ember and Wade walk toward a deserted GARDEN CENTRAL STATION,
      passing the VIVISTERIA SIGN we saw in Ember's flashback. It
      now has a banner over it, CLOSED.

                            EMBER
                  Wade, what are we doing here?

                               WADE
                  Just wait!

      They stop in front of a chain link fence.

      Wade takes off his shirt, throws it over the fence and then
      walks easily right through, diving back into his shirt on the
      other side.

      Ember also walks right through, melting the metal.

                            WADE
                  Why do they even have these?

                            EMBER
                  Eh, who knows.

      They continue on toward the station. The NO FIRE sign still
      stands in the entryway.

      Wade knocks it over.


      INT. GARDEN CENTRAL STATION - SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

      The station is decrepit. The TILE on the walls is broken and
      there are just hints it was once incredibly ornate. Entrance
      stairs from ground level lead down then vanish into a dark,
      flooded tunnel.

      Reveal Gale in front of the flooded tunnel.

                            GALE
                  Hey! It's my favorite fire ball!

      Ember is puzzled.

                            EMBER
                  Hey Gale... what's going on?

                             WADE
                  I know you think you have to end
                  this but..
                       (re: water)
                  That flooded tunnel? It goes to the
                  main terminal.

                              EMBER
                  O-kay?

                            WADE
                  Do you still want to see a
                  Vivisteria?

      Ember is shocked... for real? Wade gestures toward GALE.

                              WADE
                  Gale?

      Gale BLOWS a HUGE bubble in the water, big enough for Ember
      to get into. She holds the bubble closed at the water's
      surface. Ember's eyes widen as she realizes what Wade's
      thinking.

                            EMBER
                  Wait, I'm supposed to get in there?

                            WADE
                  The air should last...

                            GALE
                  ...at least twenty minutes.

      Ember looks to Wade, hesitant.

                            WADE
                  THEY said you couldn't go in
                  there... Why does ANYONE get to
                  tell you what you can do in your
                  life?

      Ember looks at the bubble, then back to Wade. He gives her an
      encouraging nod.

      She steps to the edge of the water... and jumps in.



�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                 99.


      Inside the bubble, Ember opens her eyes - it worked!

                              EMBER
                  Whoa.

      Getting her bearings, she looks out from the bubble down the
      long dark passageway. Wade swims around and gives her two
      thumbs up. He grabs her bubble and starts swimming them
      deeper. From the surface, Gale waves.


      INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

      Wade holds Ember's bubble and swims them down the staircase.
      Ember looks to Wade who gives her a reassuring smile.

      They reach the bottom of the stairs and emerge into an old
      train station. Ember's light illuminates the walls. It's
      gorgeous. Somehow, preserved under water, is the opulence of
      another era... beautiful tile walls, vaulted ceilings.

      Ember looks up at the GARDEN CENTRAL STATION platform sign.

      Wade and Ember explore an old subway car, looking through
      it's windows into the interior. Ember's glow lights up their
      surroundings and startles a school of fish. They swim at
      Ember, swirling around her bubble.

      Ember and Wade follow the fish up a staircase. It opens up
      into the GRAND BALLROOM of the station. And in the middle of
      it, growing in the double-helix, is the DORMANT Vivisteria
      plant. No flowers.

      Wade and Ember are entranced at seeing it. Wade pushes Ember
      closer and as her light hits the vine, the bud closest to
      them BLOOMS.

                            EMBER
                       (whispered)
                  A Vivisteria.

      Ember's light grows almost entirely prismatic, casting
      caustics. They're both in awe. They swim up the vine. As
      Ember's light hits the plant, more flowers bloom.

      Another cloud of fish sends Ember's bubble spinning.

                              EMBER
                  Whoa.

      More BLOOMS. She glows brighter and the vine EXPLODES with
      flowers. They swim together through the vines. Ember reaches
      toward the flowers. It's a shared, magical moment.

                                                                  100.


      BUT suddenly the bubble begins to shrink around Ember as air
      is used up. The bubble's wall touches the top of Ember's
      flame.

                              EMBER
                  Ouch!

                            WADE
                  Hey! You're running out of air!

      Ember is alarmed. Wade looks around and spots an exit.

      He swims her shrinking bubble as fast as he can up the
      stairwell.

      As Ember's bubble gets tighter, she starts to hyperventilate,
      burning up what little oxygen she has left.

                            WADE
                  Almost there. Try to breathe slow
                  and steady.

      Ember nods and manages to slow her breathing down as Wade
      pushes her up.

      Wade swims with all his might.

      They see light-- they must be nearing the surface. They break
      through just in time.


      EXT. MINERAL LAKE - OLD SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

      Ember and Wade burst out of an old entrance at Mineral Lake.
      They lay there breathing heavily.

      Wade looks at Ember, worried.

                            WADE
                  I'm so sorry, I should never have--

      She springs up onto her feet.

                            EMBER
                  Are you kidding? That was amazing.
                  I finally saw a Vivisteria!

      Wade stands and walks toward her.

                             WADE
                  It was inspiring. You were
                  inspiring.

      Ember looks at him, suddenly serious. Wade just stares into
      her eyes, calm. He holds his hand out to her.

                            EMBER
                  No. Wade, we can't touch.

                            WADE
                  Maybe we can.

      Ember furrows her brow. She takes a few steps away and stares
      at the water.

                              EMBER
                  No.

                            WADE
                  But can't we just prove it.

      She turns back to Wade.

                            EMBER
                  Prove what?

                            WADE
                  Let's see what happens, and if it's
                  a disaster then we'll know this
                  would never work.

                            EMBER
                  But it actually could be a
                  disaster. I could vaporize you. You
                  could extinguish me. And then--

                            WADE
                  Let's... let's start small.

      Wade holds his hand out to Ember. After a moment, she
      tentatively reaches towards it. She hovers her hand over his.
      Her hand flickers and his starts to bubble.

      She tries again. Placing her palm in his, they TOUCH, in awe.
      Water boiling, steam, chemistry.

      They're touching and they're okay... equalizing. His water
      gently simmers from her heat. She pulls her steaming hand
      away and examines it. She looks to Wade, also inspecting his
      hand.

      They step closer and press their fingertips and then their
      full palms together. Wade's water pushes back to match the
      strength of her heat. Their hands find a tingly equilibrium.
      It's a magical moment, a coming together like a kiss. They
      lock eyes then grasp both hands and lean in. In each other's
      arms, they dance.

                            WADE
                       (intimate, soft)
                  I'm so lucky.

      SUDDENLY there's a quick POP:

      -- A tired Bernie from before, heading upstairs to bed:

                            BERNIE
                  I'm so lucky I have you.

      MORE flashes:

      -- Ember and Bernie at the Blue Flame together.

      -- Ember helping a tired Bernie up from the counter.

      -- Bernie and Ember sharing a warm hug.

      -- Ember's new SIGN.

      OUT OF FLASHBACK Ember ZIPS up her fire, covering her
      vulnerable light, and pulls away from Wade.

                            EMBER
                  I have to go.

      She runs away along the lake path.

                            WADE
                  Wait, what? Where are you going?

      She hurries up the Wetro stairs and Wade follows.

                            EMBER
                  Back to my life at the shop. Where
                  I belong. I take over tomorrow.

      Wade jumps in front of her, stopping her.

                            WADE
                  Whoa whoa whoa, hold up. You don't
                  WANT that. You said so yourself.

                            EMBER
                  It doesn't matter what I want.

                            WADE
                  Of course it does!!

      She moves past him, up the stairs toward the train platform.
      Wade, totally confused, follows.

                            WADE
                  Listen LISTEN!! You've got an
                  opportunity to do something you
                  WANT with your life!

      This stops her. She turns around.

                            EMBER
                  WANT? Yeah, that may work in your
                  rich kid follow-your-heart family.
                  But getting to "do what you want"
                  is a luxury. And not for people
                  like me.

                            WADE
                  Why not?? Just tell your father how
                  you feel. This is too important.
                  Maybe he'll agree.

                            EMBER
                       (scoff)
                  Oh, ha. Yeah.

      There's no WAY she will do that. Wade sets his jaw.

                            WADE
                  Funny. And this whole time I
                  thought you were so strong, but it
                  turns out... you're just afraid.

      That hurts... and is probably true. Ember BLAZES.

                            EMBER
                  Don't you DARE judge me. You don't
                  know what it's like to have parents
                  who gave up EVERYTHING for you. I'm
                  FIRE, Wade. I can't be anything
                  more than that. It's what I am, and
                  what my FAMILY is. It's our way of
                  LIFE. I cannot throw all of that
                  away JUST FOR YOU.

                            WADE
                  I don't understand!

                            EMBER
                  And that alone is a reason this
                  could never work.

      As she boards the train,

                            EMBER
                  It's over, Wade.

      The train pulls away. Wade is left alone on the platform.


      INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Inside, Ember is about to cry. She takes a deep breath, then
      puts her hood on and armors up.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - THE NEXT EVENING

      The street outside the shop is set for a party. A stage has
      been erected, lights hung. The community has gathered for the
      big event.

      Inside the shop, Bernie lights a lantern, the one he brought
      with him from Fire Land, with the Blue Flame.

      Outside, Ember and Cinder sit on stage together. They all
      wear colorful, festive outfits. Ember smiles as Bernie exits
      the shop. He climbs on stage, places the flame on a pedestal,
      and takes the microphone.

                             BERNIE
                  Everyone. Welcome! It is good to
                  see your faces.
                        (getting emotional)
                  I am honored to have served you.
                  But it's time to move on.
                        (to Ember)
                  Come.

      Ember stands next to him.

                            BERNIE
                  My daughter. You are the Ember of
                  our family fire... That is why, I
                  am so proud to have you take over
                  my life's work.

      A rope hangs on the microphone stand. Bernie take it in his
      hands and with a squeeze, he lights it. The rope burns like a
      fuse leading to decorations covering the sign on the front of
      the shop. There's a big BLAZE and when the fire passes we see
      that Ember's SIGN is lit up. Everyone applauds.

                            BERNIE
                       (winks to Ember)
                  Pretty good trick, huh?

      Bernie then gently picks up the lantern and turns to Ember.

                                                                 105.


                            BERNIE
                  This is lantern I bring from old
                  country. Today, I pass it on to
                  you.

      People in the crowd are touched. Ember reaches to take the
      lantern, but hesitates. This is a big moment. But just as
      she's about to grab it:

                            WADE (O.S.)
                  I thought of other reasons.

      Ember looks up. A Wetro train passes and when the CURTAIN of
      water clears we see Wade, standing heroic.

                              EMBER
                  Wade?

      Ember is shocked. Cinder looks nervously at Bernie.

                            CINDER
                       (under her breath)
                  Oh boy.

                            EMBER
                  What are you doing here?

      Wade walks toward her, entering the party.

                            WADE
                  You said me not understanding is
                  the reason we can never work. But I
                  thought of other reasons. A bunch
                  of them. Like, number 1: you're
                  Fire, I'm Water. I mean, come on
                  that's crazy. Right?

      A guest near him nods.

                            BERNIE
                  Who is this?

                            CINDER
                       (bad lying)
                  No idea.

      But Wade is focused in on Ember. He continues toward the
      stage.

                            WADE
                  Number 2: I'm crashing your party.
                  Like what kind of a jerk am I?

      Ember is unflinching.

                            EMBER
                  A pretty big one.

                            WADE
                  Right? Number 3... I can't eat
                  your... delicious foods!

      Wade takes a hot coal from Flarry and Flarrietta's table. He
      let's it boil down his throat. His head bubbles and pops.

                            WADE
                       (strained)
                  VERY unpleasant.

      Bernie suddenly realizes:

                             BERNIE
                       (to Cinder)
                  Wait, I know him! He is food
                  inspector!

                            WADE
                  Oh right! Number 4! I'm banned from
                  your father's shop.

      He steps closer.

                            WADE
                  There are a MILLION reasons why
                  this can't work. A million "no's."
                  But there's also one "yes."

      Ember is being drawn in.

                            WADE
                  We touched.

      Bernie and Cinder are shocked.

                            WADE
                  And when we did, something happened
                  to us. Something IMPOSSIBLE. We
                  changed each other's chemistry.

      They look deep into one another's eyes. Suddenly Bernie
      erupts, exasperated.

                            BERNIE
                  Enough! What kind of food
                  inspection is this??

      This yanks Ember back to reality.

                            WADE
                  A food inspection of the heart,
                  sir.

      Bernie steps up to Wade, confrontational. Ember is frozen.

                            BERNIE
                  Who are you???

                            WADE
                       (romantic to Ember)
                  Just a guy who burst into your
                  daughter's life in a flooded old
                  basement.

                            BERNIE
                  So you ARE the one who burst the
                  pipes!

                            WADE
                  What? Not me, it was...

      Wade's eyes unintentionally dart toward Ember. Ember-- no!
      Too late. Bernie turns to Ember.

                            BERNIE
                       (hurt, to Ember)
                  You... you burst the pipe??

                              EMBER
                  I, I...

                              WADE
                  Ember--

                              BERNIE
                  Silence!!

                              WADE
                  No!
                       (to Ember)
                  Take the chance. Let your father
                  know who you really are.

      Ember hesitates torn between Wade and Bernie.

                            WADE
                  Look, I had regrets when my dad
                  died, but because of you I learned
                  to "embrace the light while it
                  burns."

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  I love you Ember Lumen. And I'm
                  pretty sure you love me too.

      Ember is torn between two worlds. She puts up her fire wall.

                            EMBER
                  No Wade. I don't.


      EXT. CULVERT - SAME TIME

      A CRACK suddenly appears in the GLASS DAM.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Cinder can't take it.

                            CINDER
                  That's not true! I did their
                  reading!

                            CINDER
                  Bernie, it's love. It's true love.

                            EMBER
                  No mom, you're wrong. Wade, go.

                            WADE
                  But, Ember--

      Almost as if the power of her FLARE has reached all of
      Element City, another CRACK breaks in the dam and WATER
      starts to SPRAY out. It's going to BLOW.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - BACK TO SCENE

      Back on Ember.

                              EMBER

      Wade, defeated, takes the GLASS VIVISTERIA out of his pocket
      and places it on the stage at Ember's feet. He turns and
      walks out, heartbroken.

      Bernie glares at Ember, devistated.

                             BERNIE
                   You have been seeing WATER??

      He coughs.

                               EMBER
                   �shf� I--

                             BERNIE
                        (betrayed)
                   You caused leak in shop???
                        (deeply hurt)
                   I TRUSTED YOU!

      Ember looks down, unable to confess. Bernie COUGHS more.

                             BERNIE
                   You will not take over the shop.
                        (coughs)
                   I no longer retire.

      Bernie grabs the lantern. He storms off the stage and into
      the shop.

      Ember crushed, looks down at the glass Vivisteria.


      EXT. BRIDGE - LATER

      CROSS FADE to Ember riding her scooter through Firetown and
      up onto the bridge.

      CUT TO her sitting on a bench, head hung. She's removed her
      ceremonial jacket. She stands and walks to the bridge
      railing.

      We see a FLASH of her and Wade, touching for the first time
      at Mineral Lake.

      BACK ON the bridge, Ember pulls the GLASS Vivisteria ball out
      of her pocket.

      She looks to Firetown, then to Element City.

                             EMBER
                        (to herself)
                   Why can't I just be a good

      She holds the GLASS Vivisteria ball to her forehead then
      pulls it away.

      A look of RAGE and FRUSTRATION crosses her face and she
      starts to throw it into the water, but she can't.

      She looks directly at the glass Vivisteria. We see her
      reflection WITH a reflection of Element City and Firetown.
      She is BOTH things.

      SUDDENLY... she hears a boom in the distance--

      CUT TO the CULVERT, as the GLASS from the dam suddenly gives
      way.

      A wall of water POURS out. Its enormous force crumbles the
      sides of the culvert, toppling a towering windmill.

      BACK WITH EMBER as she sees that all of the PENT UP water
      RUSHING down the culvert right toward Firetown!

      A DELUGE is coming and it is heading right toward Bernie's
      Shop.

                              EMBER
                  Firetown!

      Ember starts her scooter and rushes off.


      INT. GRAND GATEWAY - SAME TIME

      An emotional Wade holds a ticket and addresses Brook, Alan,
      Eddy, Harold, Lake, Marco and Polo, who stand across from
      him.

                            WADE
                  Well, one way ticket to anywhere
                  but here.

                            BROOK
                  Go! Travel the world. Heal that
                  broken heart.

      Brook mimes holding a baby in her arms.

                            BROOK
                       (singing, tearing up)
                  My little drip-drip-baby-boy.

      Tears flow down Wade's face.

                            BROOK
                       (crying)
                  Drip drip drip goes the baby boy--

      Harold interjects:

                            HAROLD
                       (tearing up)
                  I made you a painting. It's of a
                  lonely man awash in sadness.

      Harold hands Wade a painting that is LITERALLY Wade standing
      and crying, just as he looks right now.

      Wade bursts into tears. Everyone sobs.

      SUDDENLY, a siren. Wade instantly stops crying. Through a
      doorway, he spots steam rising up from Firetown. Oh no.

                              WADE
                  Ember.


      EXT. BRIDGE TO FIRETOWN - SOON AFTER

      Ember races her scooter across the bridge into Firetown.

      Ahead of her, water rushes down the culvert toward the shop.
      Ember sees her parents out in front, cleaning up from the
      party, and calls out to them:

                              EMBER
                  Mom! Dad!

      But they don't hear her. Ahead, the river slams into the
      elevated water train track. The track crashes down, spilling
      even more water.

      Determined, Ember speeds up and pulls off the bridge, racing
      the flood of water toward the shop.


      EXT. FIRETOWN - CONTINUOUS

      Water starts to fill the street. With dare-devil moves, Ember
      crosses the culvert.

      She speeds along the Firetown sidewalk toward the shop,
      calling out to the neighborhood:

                            EMBER
                  Water's coming!!




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                 112.


      There's a panic as Fire folks seek safety. Ember speeds by,
      the flood at her heels.

                            EMBER
                  Watch out! Behind you! Climb!
                  Climb! Flash flood! Hurry!

      Ember nears the shop and desperately shouts to her parents.

                            EMBER
                  Mom! Water! Get to higher ground!

      Cinder hears and grabs Bernie and pulls him to leave.

                               CINDER
                  Bernie!

      But the deluge catches up to Ember's scooter and the vehicle
      starts to hydroplane. Water splashes up on her leg.

                             EMBER
                        (wincing)
                  Ow!

      The water in the street quickly gets too deep to ride the
      scooter. Ember leaps off onto a floating truck and looks
      ahead as water reaches the shop where she sees the flood of
      water lift up the stage from the party, carrying Bernie and
      Cinder with it.

      They cling to each other as they're tossed about. Bernie
      lunges toward the shop but Cinder stops him.

                            BERNIE
                  The flame! Let me go!

      Bernie then sees Ember, leaping from floating debris to
      floating debris, fighting to get to shop.

                               BERNIE
                  Ember no!!

      But Ember is on a mission. She gets to the front of the shop
      and takes one final, giant leap and lands, grasping the
      transom window over the shop's front door.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      Ember climbs through into the shop and takes in the scene.
      Water is leaking everywhere, and right behind her around the
      front door.




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                  113.


      Ember shoulders into the door trying to stop it, but pressure
      builds -- spouts of water begin to JET through the WIDENING
      cracks around the door, AND FLOW toward the BLUE FLAME.

      Ember quickly grabs sandbags and throws them at the door.
      Standing on the bags, she presses her whole weight into the
      door, trying to hold the everything back, but the rising
      water nips at her feet. It's dire.

      SUDDENLY, through the glass of the door, TWO EYES appear.

      Ember is stunned to see Wade, smashed uncomfortably against
      the glass. The ROAR of the flood is deafening.

                               EMBER
                  Wade??

      Wade gestures toward the door handle.

                            WADE
                       (muffled)
                  Key-hole!

      Getting it, Ember yanks out the key and Wade painfully,
      squeezes through the keyhole...

                               WADE
                  Gahhhhhh!!

      ...and puddles on the ground. He re-forms and springs into
      action, joining Ember at the door.

                            WADE
                       (effort)
                  I was hoping to make a more heroic
                  entrance.

      Together, face to face, they hold back the door.

                            EMBER
                  You came back after everything I
                  said.

                            WADE
                  Are you kidding? And miss all this?

      Ember smiles. Then sees that the water is almost at the BLUE
      FLAME.

                            EMBER
                       (to Wade)
                  Hold the door!

                                                                114.


      She grabs more sandbags and races to the flame, leaping
      between shelves.

      She places sandbags in a circle around the Blue Flame. Then
      she FLAMES BIG and starts to make glass.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      The waters are VIOLENT... Bernie and Cinder watch as the shop
      sign tumbles off the building and SPASHES into the water.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      As water fills the shop, Ember QUICKLY builds a glass shield
      around the Blue Flame while Wade does his best to hold back
      the door... but it's a losing battle... water begins to reach
      Ember's glass barrier.

                            EMBER
                  No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

      And the windows begin to burst from the pressue. The window
      in the door window behind Wade gives way.

      There's no holding it back.

      The water rises faster. The lantern from Fire Land, the one
      that carried the Blue Flame to Element City, is swept into
      the flow. So is the photo of Ember's childhood birthday.

      Wade reads the situation:

                            WADE
                  Ember we have to go!

      He strains as water pours in over his shoulders.

                            WADE
                  We have to go. NOW.

                            EMBER
                  I can't leave!

      The water is rising quickly toward the top of her protective
      glass cylinder.

                            WADE
                  I'm sorry to say this but the shop
                  is done. The flame is done.




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                                  115.


                            EMBER
                  No! This is my father's whole life.
                  I'm not going anywhere!

      SUDDENLY, WATER SMASHES through a large window and POURS in,
      taking everything with it.

      A shelf topples and SLAMS into Ember's glass cylinder,
      SMASHING through the glass and into the flame.

      A rush of water forces the door open, knocking Wade over.

      Water and debris surround the Blue Flame. Ember climbs up on
      a box to avoid the rising water. She shouts to Wade,

                            EMBER
                  Throw me that lantern!

      As Wade swims for the lantern, he's knocked over by a huge
      wave.

                              WADE
                  Ah!

      Ember, the flame, and Wade are PUSHED VIOLENTLY toward
      Cinder's office in the OLD FIREPLACE HEARTH.


      INT. CINDER'S HEARTH - CONTINUOUS

      Debris SLAMS into the opening, sealing Ember inside... with
      the BASE of the Blue Flame... but the flame is out. Ember is
      horrified!

                              EMBER
                  No!

      CUT TO outside the hearth, everything in the shop is
      underwater. The birthday photo floats by.

      BACK IN THE HEARTH Ember looks takes in her situation. She's
      trapped and the Blue Flame is gone. It appears everything is
      lost.

                            EMBER
                  No, no no no no no.

      But just then, Wade climbs out from the debris holding a
      lantern lit with the Blue Flame. Ember is thrilled.

                              EMBER
                  Oh Wade!

                                                                  116.


                            EMBER
                  Thank you, thank you.

      He hands it to her. She smiles, relieved. They share a
      moment. Then suddenly Ember flinches in pain.

                              EMBER
                  Ah!

      Water has seeped in through the pile of debris, and hit her
      leg. She looks up at the blocked entrance. Water is squirting
      through the cracks.

      She goes to the wall of debris and HEATS it up, flaring hot,
      melting metal to seal the cracks.

      And it works! The leaks stop... but Wade is boiling.

                            WADE
                  It's too hot in here.

      Oh no! They have to get out of there. Ember looks up the
      chimney stack - it's open to the sky.

                              EMBER
                  Climb!

      Ember starts to climb and Wade follows...


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      The street outside is a river. A floating bus crashes into
      the side of the shop. The building shakes and the top of the
      chimney CRASHES DOWN.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - HEARTH - SAME TIME

      Wade and Ember are inside the chimney as debris tumbles down
      around them.

                            EMBER
                  BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP!

                              WADE
                  Ah!

      They drop back down into the hearth. It's an even tighter
      space now, more filled with debris.

      And it's even hotter. Wade is steaming.

      Desperate, Ember tries to burn through the wall of debris.

                                                                   117.


      Wade reaches up and tries to move the bricks blocking the
      chimney, but they don't budge.

                            EMBER
                  I have to open that up!

                            WADE
                  No! The water will come in and
                  you'll be snuffed out.

                            EMBER
                  But you're evaporating! I don't
                  know what to do!

                               WADE
                  It's okay.

                            EMBER
                  No, it's not okay!

      Wade is boiling. She's horrified. He takes her hand.

                            WADE
                  Ember... I have no regrets. You
                  gave me something people search for
                  their whole lives.

                            EMBER
                  But I can't exist in a world
                  without you! I'm sorry I didn't say
                  it before. I love you, Wade.

      Steam surrounds them.

      Ember's vulnerable light casts caustics on the wall.

      Wade looks from her to the caustics around the room with a
      sense of peace.

                             WADE
                  I really do love it when your light
                  does that.

      They embrace. All is silent. Steam fills the hearth.


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - LATER

      Firetown is a wreck.      Everything is soaked, so much is
      destroyed.




�2023 DISNEY�PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
                                                               118.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      Inside the shop, the WATER has receded but everything we saw
      of Bernie's world is ruined.

      Bernie, Cinder and others work their way through the debris.

                            FIRST CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                  They're in the hearth!

      A large Fire Element clears debris away from the opening to
      the hearth.

      They pull aside the Blue Flame's base and we reveal:

      Ember. She's kneeling on broken bricks, hugging the lantern
      with the Blue Flame.

      Relieved, Bernie and Cinder move toward her. But they stop.
      She's not getting up or even turning toward them.

                            EMBER
                  Wade is gone.

      Cinder hurries over to her.

                            CINDER
                  Oh my daughter.

                            EMBER
                  He saved me.

      Bernie's face falls, he knows loss.

      Ember slowly stands, holding the Blue Flame, and she faces
      Bernie and finally says the most difficult thing she's ever
      said:

                             EMBER
                  Dad... this is all my fault. The
                  shop... Wade-- I need to tell you
                  the truth.

      Her flame grows dim, vulnerable.

                            EMBER
                  I don't want to run the shop. I
                  know that was your dream, but it's
                  not mine. I'm sorry. I'm a bad
                  daughter.

      Ember hands the lantern to Bernie. He takes it, looks at it
      in his hand, then puts it down.

                                                                  119.


                            BERNIE
                  Ember, the shop was never the
                  dream. YOU were the dream. You were
                  always the dream.

      Ember looks up, surprised, moved, a burden lifted. She then
      hugs her dad, crying in his arms. There are no more lies.

                            EMBER
                  I loved him dad.

      Ember kneels, crying. Her light dims even more, cool, loving.
      Bernie's matches hers. Cinder joins them. A family,
      heartbroken, but one unit.

      Then... we hear a distant, familiar whimper.

      Ember breaks from her parents' embrace and looks into the
      hearth.

      And that's when we reveal CONDENSATION in the chimney. A
      SINGLE DROP of water falls from the ceiling into a bucket.

      Ember looks up at the condensation... no, it can't be. She
      gets an idea and says:

                            EMBER
                  Butterfly...

      She stares hopefully up at the ceiling.

                            EMBER
                  Butterfly. Windshield wipers. Half
                  a butterfly.

      Another whimper. A few more drops fall into the bucket.

      Ember is energized... maybe it CAN be...

                            EMBER
                  An old man on his deathbed
                  remembers the summer he fell in
                  love...

      More drops. Water starts to pool. Ember gets brighter. We
      hear more faint weeping from WADE.

      It's working, Ember can hardly believe it.

                            EMBER
                  She was out of his league and he
                  was young and scared. He let her go
                  thinking surely summer would come
                  again. It never did.

      Water is falling harder. Wade's cries are building.

      Water streams off the ceiling into the bucket. Cinder pieces
      it together. She looks up at the ceiling...

                            CINDER
                  You are perfect match... ten out of
                  ten!

      More weeping, more rain drops. Bernie looks to Cinder.

                            BERNIE
                  I don't understand. What's going
                  on?

                            CINDER
                  Just say something to make Water
                  guy cry, okay?

      Bernie gives it a try.

                            BERNIE
                  Um, uh... you are no longer panned.

                            WADE
                       (whimpering)
                  Banned.

                              BERNIE
                  Banned.

      Wade WAILS. Drops POUR. Ember, drops falling all around her,
      YELLS to the world:

                            EMBER
                  I want to explore the world with
                  you, Wade Ripple! I want to have
                  you with me, in my life. Forever!

      One more drop and then, they stop. The bucket is full. Ember
      peers into the bucket... two eyes appear. Then a smile. Wade
      stands up, alive!

                              WADE
                  Whoa.

      He turns to face them. Naked, he picks up his shirt from the
      rubble.

                            WADE
                  Your, uh, chimney needs cleaning.

      Everyone is stunned.

      And then Ember runs to Wade, throwing her arms around him.

      Then, they KISS! LIGHT shines through the room. It's
      breathtaking.

      Cinder beams. Bernie glances away.

      Ember and Wade break out to the kiss, look deep into each
      other's eyes and embrace.

                            CINDER
                  I KNEW it! My nose ALWAYS knows.

      Everyone laughs.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


      EXT. FIRETOWN STREETS - MONTHS LATER

      TITLE: MONTHS LATER...

      Elements mingle on the Firetown sidewalks. Folks are fixing
      the last of the damage from the flood. The town is almost
      fully restored.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      The fixed-up shop is busy. We see a fresh pot of Lava Java
      brewing.

      We find Clod on a ladder, wearing an apron, clearly now an
      employee. But he's not working, he's talking to an age-
      appropriate FIRE GIRL.

                            CLOD
                  If you were a vegetable, you'd be a
                  cute-cumber.

      He holds up his arm, revealing a small cluster of blooms.    He
      yanks them out and hands her the bouquet.

                            CLOD
                       (pained effort)
                  My queen.

      We pick up Gale as she walks through, dressed in a
      Windbreakers jersey.

                            GALE
                  Uh! I can't believe I was gonna
                  shut this place down.

                                                                 122.


      She backs up into an Earth Guy who we see is FERN with short,
      flowering hair. He's also wearing a Wind Breakers shirt.

                            GALE
                  Whoa! Sorry.
                       (gasp, noticing)
                  Fern? You're a Windbreakers fan?

                               FERN
                  Toot toot.

      Gale is immediately drawn to him.

                            GALE
                  Toot. Tooooooot.

      Flarry and Flarrietta stand behind the counter.

                            FLARRIETTA
                  Oy. You know what I like best about
                  running this shop?

                            FLARRY
                  Not having to eat Bernie's kol-
                  nuts!

      Pan to Bernie and Cinder sitting at a table.

                            BERNIE
                       (laugh)
                  Sorry. I couldn't hear you through
                  my retirement.

      Everyone BURSTS OUT LAUGHING... the laughing continues as we
      go outside...


      EXT. BERNIE'S SHOP - SAME TIME

      ...to find Ember. She approaches, taking a beat to stand in
      front of the shop. She looks up, the original shop sign is
      back, without her name.


      INT. BERNIE'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      Ember enters quietly and watches the shop, full of life.

                               GALE
                  Ooh!

      The Fire Girl chases Clod past the counter.

      Ember watches everyone with fondness. Bernie feeds Cinder a
      kol-nut. Then, he sees Ember. They share a smile. A
      connection.

      But then Wade enters. He yells to the room:

                              WADE
                  Hey!

      Everyone happily turns to the doorway.

                   BERNIE                             CINDER
      Wade!                                Hi Wade!

                 FLARRIETTA                           FLARRY
      Wade!                                Hi Wade!

                            CLOD
                  Hey Wade! Yo yo yo!

      Wade turns to Ember...

                            WADE
                  Ember, it's time.

      Ember smiles, a little sad.


      EXT. GRAND GATEWAY - SOON AFTER

      Ember and Wade, luggage in hand, stand next to a large boat.
      Bernie, Cinder and Brook stand facing them.

                            WADE
                  You know, I'm not really one for
                  tearful goodbyes.

      Brook bursts out crying.

                            BROOK
                       (sobbing)
                  Oh Wade, you big liar.
                       (singing)
                  Drip drip drip...

      Wade joins her in the song.

                            BROOK, WADE
                       (starting to sob)
                  Goes the baby boy.

      They hug, Brook lifting Wade up. They hold each other, ugly-
      crying.

      Bernie and Ember exchange a look.

                            BERNIE
                  Uh, are you sure about this one?

      Ember smiles.

                            EMBER
                  I'm sure.
                       (then, sincere)
                  Dad, I'm sorry the internship is so
                  far away. I mean it's the best
                  glass design company in the world,
                  but who knows if it'll become a
                  real job. I'll be back in a few
                  months anyway, and it might not end
                  up being anything--

                            BERNIE
                  Ay-yah, shhh. Go. Start new life.
                  Your mother and I will be here. Now
                  with more time for hanky-panky.

      Cinder gives his side a playful slap.

                            CINDER
                  �... sh�tsh!

      They all laugh.

      Ember and Wade walk to the boat. Wade starts up the ramp.
      Ember is about to take a STEP but pauses. She turns to her
      parents, smiles at Bernie, then sets down her luggage... and
      then gives the BIG CEREMONIAL BOW.

      Cinder gasps. Bernie, tears in his eyes, steps forward and
      RETURNS THE BOW.

      They have a moment -- a weight lifted for both of them. A
      blessing for father and daughter, and a trauma healed.

      Then the boat sounds its horn, and they stand.

      Ember picks up her bag, faces the boat and takes a deep
      breath.

      She STEPS onto the ramp and boards.

      The screen goes to BLACK.
