INT. MITCHELL HOME - NURSERY - NIGHT

A BABY MOBILE GENTLY TURNS as it's hung above the crib. PULL
BACK TO REVEAL MADISON MITCHELL, 30s, sweet, as she finishes
hanging the mobile. There are unopened PRESENTS piled on the
dresser, the bounty from a recent baby shower.

Madison stands back, admiring her work. She HUMS a lullaby,
rubbing her small belly, happy. Content.

A SHADOW passes over the room, like an eclipse.

                      DEREK
          What the hell are you doing?

Madison JUMPS, turning -- her husband, DEREK MITCHELL, 50s,
stands in the doorway. He holds a gym bag, agitated.
Immediately there's tension. Madison cowers, trying to make
herself smaller. Her hands cover her belly, protective.

                      DEREK (CONT'D)
          Are you coming to bed?

                      MADISON
          I must have lost track of the time--

Derek storms over to her. Madison stays put -- she knows
better than to move. She looks down, not making eye contact.

                      DEREK
          This is what you'd rather be doing
          than spending time with me?

                       MADISON
          It's for the baby.
              (off his look)
          I just -- I wanted to put it up.

                        DEREK
          It's up.

                        MADISON
          I'm coming.    Sorry.

She tries to move but he stands there, blocking her, towering
over her. Enjoying her fear.

                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          Derek, you can't do this. The
          doctor said the baby's not
          developing like she should. I don't
          think stress is good--

Derek tenses, eyeing her, offended.

                      DEREK
          You think this is my fault?
                                                              2.

Madison instantly knows she's overstepped, back-peddles...

                      MADISON
          I just-- I just meant.

But it's too late. Derek has already gone from zero to rage.
He violently POKES her in her stomach.

                      DEREK
          This. Is. Not. My. Fault.
          Whatever's wrong with it is because
          of you.

The abuse against her abdomen incites Madison's anger. The
LIGHTS FLICKER. Derek notices, just as Madison PUSHES him.

                      MADISON
          DON'T TOUCH HER--

Derek comes back, SLAMMING the back of Madison's head against
the wall. Madison slides to the floor, dazed. Derek SLAPS
her. Madison's hands protect her stomach.

                       MADISON (CONT'D)
          Please!   Just stop! Derek, the
          baby!

                      DEREK
          Fuckin' sleep here for all I care.

Derek leaves Madison crumpled on the floor.

INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT

Madison sits in the tub, cradling herself as water cascades
over her from the shower.

She silently cries to herself, her back is filled with SCARS
and BRUISES, a lattice-work of pain. (Note: the scars will          
later be revealed to be surgical, but we shouldn't know that
now.) There's a bit of BLOOD flowing down her back, from a          
wound in her head.

INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
Madison sits at her vanity, holding a wet towel to the back
of her head. She looks in the mirror. The image of a
battered woman. She can't bring herself to even look herself
in the eyes.
                       VOICE
              (whispers)
          MADISON.

Madison STARTLES.   Whips around.   She's alone.   Then she
finds --
Derek standing in the doorway. He looks forlorn, his eyes
wet with tears. He steps in, sheepish, apologetic.
                                                             3.

                      DEREK
          Are you mad at me?
Madison shakes her head. This isn't the first time she's
seen him like this. It's the pattern.
                        DEREK (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.    I don't know what came
          over me.
Madison nods, going along with it.
                      DEREK (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna do better. For you. For
          the baby. I love you, you know
          that.
                      MADISON
          I love you too.
Derek kisses her forehead.   For a moment they look like a
happy, normal couple.
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - NIGHT - LATER
The house sits in a quiet neighborhood.   All the houselights
are off, save for the porch light.
A breeze rustles through the trees, and dead leaves skitter
across the driveway. The porch light starts to zap
intermittently.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Derek is dead asleep.
Madison sleeps on her side, cradling her baby. She pulls the
covers over her head, burying herself in darkness.
ON DEREK. O.S. there's a NOISE. Derek stirs. In the
hallway, the floorboards CREAK, like footsteps moving away.
Derek glances to the other side of the bed. His wife is a
lump buried under the covers. O.S. there's another NOISE.
The STAIRS are creaking. Someone is in the house. Derek
gets up to investigate.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Derek comes down the stairs. He walks down the hall.
Peering around corners, into the darkness. From the KITCHEN,
a loud sound whirs on.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Derek steps in. The electric mixer is going. Derek looks
around, confused. He turns it off. Silence again.
Suddenly, a light source is thrown across Derek's back.   He
turns around and sees the fridge door is creaking open.
                                                           4.

                       DEREK
           What the hell?
He looks around the kitchen. Sees no one. What's going on?
He slowly paces up to the fridge, and shuts the door.
Derek stands by the fridge, feeling unnerved, when suddenly --
-- the sound of a TV bursting on, catches him off guard.   He
storms out of the kitchen and into --
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
-- the living room where the TV is switching frantically
between channels of informercials, at full volume.
Derek is confused and mystified.   And then he sees something.
The glow of the TV illuminates a DARK FIGURE seated on a
couch. Watching the TV.
Derek startles.
                       DEREK
           Who the fuck are you??! What are
           you doing in my house --
The TV goes static, blaring white noise. Then the TV
switches off, plunging the whole room into darkness.
Derek immediately reaches out for the light switch, finds it,
flicks on the light --
-- and the figure is gone.
Derek scans around the room.    Nothing.
The compressed cushion of the couch, where the figure was
sitting on, slowly lifts. As though someone just got off it.
ON DEREK
A SHADOW passes behind him.    He turns --
SMACK!
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
O.S. we hear him CRY OUT. There's a loud THUD as his body
HITS the floor. We hear the repeated CRACK of Derek's head
against the floor. BLOOD pools across the floor, reaching
the hallway.
INT. HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Madison stirs, coming from under the covers. She awakes with
a pounding headache, rubbing the back of her head where Derek
had slammed it against the wall. Her nose is bleeding.
Madison wipes the blood away. She sees Derek is gone.
                                                           5.

                       MADISON
             Derek?
Silence.   Madison throws the covers off, gets up.
INT. HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Madison steps into the hallway, looking around. Turns on the
light. Sees blood on the floor. Her mouth drops open,
trying to process.
                       MADISON
             Derek?
A DARK FIGURE steps out of the living room into the hallway.      
This is THE KILLER. We do not see the Killer's's face, only       
a menacing SILHOUETTE that's almost shapeless, like the
inverse of a human being. The Killer is holding a curved,         
viciously sharp AMPUTATION KNIFE.
ON MADISON
Frozen in terror as she sees the FIGURE. She steps back.
The Killer steps forward. Madison BOLTS. The Killer gives         
chase, as Madison runs into --
INT. MITCHELL HOME - NURSERY - NIGHT
Madison slams the door shut, puts all her weight against the
door, just as the Killer POUNDS INTO IT. Madison yelps,           
bracing the door.
SMASH -- The door flies open, knocking Madison onto the
floor. She cries out in pain, and rolls onto her side to
look at the door. The Killer stands there. Very still.            
Madison scrambles, helplessly, into the closet, shutting the
doors.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - NURSERY - CLOSET - CONTINUOUS
She cowers deep into the closet, frightened beyond belief.
The Killer steps into the room.   Madison hears his footsteps.    
Heavy. Slow. Deliberate.
The Killer is taking his time, knowing she's got no where to      
go. Madison pinches her eyes shut, fighting back tears and
the urge to scream. The Killer stands before the closet           
door. He slowly runs his finger down the slats...
Click.
    Click.
           Click.
Madison SHAKES, panic and terror taking hold. Just as she
can't take the torment any more the CLOSET DOOR BURSTS OPEN.
                                                             6.

As Madison SCREAMS everything SMASHES TO BLACK--
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - DRIVEWAY - LATER
The yard is abuzz with UNIFORMED COPS and EMTS.    Worried
NEIGHBORS watching from their yards.
DETECTIVE   ERIK SHAW, 30s, Asian-Hawaiian descent, square-        
jawed boy   scout, and his partner, REGINA MOSS, 50s, African      
American,   fast approaching "too old for this shit," make
their way   inside.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
POLICE TAPE blocks off the front door. Uniformed cops and
CRIME TECHNICIANS catalogue the CRIME SCENE. Erik and Regina       
step through. An OFFICER meets them, fills them in.
                           REGINA                                  
            What we got?
                        OFFICER
            Home invasion. Dead body in the
            kitchen.
Erik and Regina follow the officer into the --                     
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Derek's body lies face up, revealing the full effect of his
attack. His face has been butchered, the nose and lips
sliced off, eyes cut out.
Erik and Regina take in the body.    It's disturbing to say the    
least.
                        REGINA                                     
            God damn. Who do you think he
            pissed off.
                        ERIK
            Any signs of forced entry?
                        OFFICER
            Not that we've seen.
Erik sees Derek's wedding ring.
                         ERIK
                (re: wedding ring)
            Wife? Husband?
                        OFFICER
            Wife. She was found upstairs,
            unconscious, hiding in a closet.
                                                              7.

INT. HOME - NURSERY - NIGHT
Officer leads Erik and Regina in.    The closet door is             
destroyed, ripped off the hinges.    Madison is gone.
                      ERIK
          Has anything been taken from the
          house?
                      OFFICER
          We won't know anything for sure
          until we talk to the wife, but she                        
          was still unconscious in the                              
          ambulance. Doubt she'll be talking                        
          tonight.                                                  
Erik glances out the nursery window.
                      ERIK                                          
          Check in with the hospital.    Let me                     
          know when she's awake.                                    
The office nods.                                                    
                      REGINA                                        
          You finish here. I'll go to the                           
          neighbors.                                                
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Private. Sterile. Madison lies in bed, unconscious.
There's a bruise above her eye.
Next to her bed, asleep in a chair, is SYDNEY LAKE, late 20s,
Madison's sister. Opposites in every way, the two look
nothing alike. Sydney holds Madison's hand.
Madison wakes up.   She looks around, confused.   Sees her
sister.
                        MADISON
          Sydney?
Sydney snaps to.    She's relieved to see her sister awake,
hugging Madison.
                      SYDNEY
          Oh thank God. You're okay.
Madison starts panicking, even in her drowsy state.
                      MADISON
          What's going on?? Where am I??
                      SYDNEY
          It's okay, calm down.     You're in a
          hospital --
                                                            8.

                       MADISON
          Where's Derek?
              (remembering)
          Oh my God. There was so much blood
          on the floor.
Sydney pulls away, holds Madison's hand.    Not quite sure how
to say it.
                       SYDNEY
          Madison.   Someone broke into your
          house...   And Derek was attacked.
Madison can tell by Sydney's look that Derek is dead.   She
covers her mouth in horror.
                      MADISON
          Oh God -- Derek -- I should've
          helped him.
She begins crying.
                      SYDNEY
          There was nothing you could do,
          Madi.
                      MADISON
          I was thinking of the baby.
It hits her. Madison's hands go to her stomach. She raises
her gown, sees the SURGICAL scar above her belly button. Her
stomach is flat. Wait..??
                       MADISON (CONT'D)
              (calmly in shock)
          Syd. Where is she...
                       SYDNEY
          Madi--
Sydney tries her best to comfort her sister and break the
news.
                       SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          The doctor said the trauma caused a
          rupture in your placenta. They had
          to operate.
              (off her look)
          They called me. I got here as fast
          as I could but by then -- it was
          either you or the baby.
Madison's whole world comes crashing down. Rocked with
emotion, she begins crying hysterically and fights to get out
of bed. Sydney struggles to hold her sister down as she
yells for help.
                                                             9.

Nurses pour into the room and administer sedative into her IV
drip, as the CAMERA pulls back into the hall, and we...
                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
INT. HOSPITAL - NURSE'S STATION - DAY
Next morning.
Erik enters, stops at the nurse's station, checking in with
the CHARGE NURSE. Erik shows his badge. She nods, POINTING
down the hall.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Madison is seated up in bed, staring out the window. Blank
expression on her pale face. Almost catatonic. She has
spent the whole night crying, now she's spent.
Erik enters, sees Madison, and carefully approaches her.
                      ERIK
          Mrs. Mitchell, I'm detective Erik
          Shaw. Sorry to bother you, but I'd
          like to ask you some questions about
          what happened last night.
Madison doesn't turn to look at Erik, or answer him.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          Mrs. Mitchell?
Still no answer.   Erik gives it a beat or two, then tries
again.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          Please Mrs. Mitchell. We need your
          assistance --
                      SYDNEY (O.C.)
          May I help you?
Erik turns to see Sydney entering the room carrying a plate
of food, which she sets next to Madison.
                     ERIK
          Oh, hi. Umm, I'm Detective Erik
          Shaw. Got a few questions I need to
          ask.
                      SYDNEY
          Can we do this later?   She just woke
          up.
                      ERIK
          I promise I won't take too much
          time. Just need to get an idea of
          what we're dealing with.
                                                         10.

                      SYDNEY
          She's been pumped full of sedative,
          she's barely lucid. You're not gonna
          get much --
                      MADISON (O.C.)
          It's okay, Sydney.
Erik and Sydney both turn to Madison who slowly looks to
Erik, and speaks in a labored manner. Still heavily drugged.
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          I don't know how much help I'll be.
          But I'll answer whatever I can...
                         ERIK
          Thank you.
Erik pulls up a chair, and sits close to Madison.   Produces a
notepad.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          I know this is sensitive, so I'll
          get straight to it -- did you see
          what happened to your husband? Did
          you see the attack?
                      MADISON
          I didn't see the attack. I heard a
          noise, it woke me up. By the time I
          got downstairs Derek was already --
Madison tenses, remembering the blood on the floor.   Sydney
gives her a reassuring squeeze.
                      SYDNEY
          You don't have to do this right now,
          Madison.
Madison gestures that she's OK.
                         MADISON
          I was in the    hallway, and I saw
          blood on the    floor from the living
          room. He --     the intruder stepped
          out -- and I    ran back upstairs.
                      ERIK
          Into the nursery?
                       MADISON
          Yes. I tried to hold the door
          closed, but he was too strong. He
          forced the door open, and then -- he
          just stood there --
              (getting scared)
          So I hid in the closet.
Erik writes into his notepad.
                                                      11.

                      ERIK
          Why did you run upstairs instead of
          running out of the house?
                      SYDNEY
          Because she was scared to death and
          didn't know what to do for fuck's
          sake!
                      ERIK
          I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name--
                        SYDNEY
          Sydney.    I'm her sister.
                      ERIK
          Ma'am, I know this is a stressful
          time but I'm trying to find the guy
          who did this. There were no signs
          of forced entry, which means it may
          have been someone you or your
          husband knew or at least someone who
          had access to your house.
This hits Madison.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          Do you know of anyone who'd want to
          hurt you or your husband, Mrs.
          Mitchell?
Madison shakes her head.
                       MADISON
          We kept to ourselves. He liked his
          privacy.
              (more to herself)
          I barely even see my family anymore.
Erik catches Sydney and Madison exchanging a look. One of
guilt, perhaps? Sydney gazes up at Erik, wants to say
something, but doesn't. Interesting. Erik writes this down.
                      ERIK
          What time would you say the attack
          took place?
                      MADISON
          I don't know.
                      ERIK
          Do you know if anything was stolen?
                      MADISON
          I don't know.
                       ERIK
          Did you get a good look at the
          perpetrator?
                                                          12.

                       MADISON
          No.   It was dark.
Madison is getting flustered with emotion.
                      SYDNEY
          Look, she just lost her husband and
          her baby. My sister needs rest, not
          an interrogation.
Erik looks surprised.
                      ERIK
          I didn't know about the child. I'm
          sorry to hear that, Mrs. Mitchell.
Erik knows he's done asking questions for the time being.   He
closes his notepad. He pulls out his card.
                       ERIK (CONT'D)
          We will catch this person.
              (holds out the card)
          If you remember anything else, or
          need any help, please call me.
Madison takes the card.   Erik leaves.
INT. MORGUE - DAY
Spacious. Sterile. Lit by harsh fluorescent lights.               
Derek's body lies on the steel table, a Y incision in his         
chest. Regina stands with the CORONER, female, been there,        
done that attitude.                                               
Erik enters, carrying two cups of coffee and a bagel. He          
hands a coffee to Regina and the bagel to the coroner.            
                      ERIK                                        
          Sorry I'm late.                                         
                      REGINA                                      
          Get anything from the widow?                            
                      ERIK                                        
          She's still in shock. Doesn't                           
          remember much. She was pregnant                         
          though. Lost the kid.                                   
                        REGINA                                    
          Jesus.                                                  
Erik's eyes fall on Derek's body.                                 
                      ERIK                                        
          What's he told you?                                     
The coroner bites into her bagel, looks over her notes.           
                                                         13.

                      CORONER                                     
          Cause of death was severe blunt                         
          force trauma to the back of his                         
          head.                                                   
                       REGINA                                     
          Really? Wow.                                            
              (to Erik)                                           
          Did you know that?                                      
                      ERIK                                        
          I mean... his brains were on the                        
          floor when we came in, but cause of                     
          death could have been anything                          
          really.                                                 
                      CORONER                                     
          Fuck the both of you. Look, it                          
          takes a lot of force to crack open a                    
                                                                  
          human's skull like this. A lot.
          Skull fractures are a dime a dozen,                     
          but to break the skull open takes                       
          force.                                                  
                      REGINA                                      
          Weapon?                                                 
                     CORONER                                      
          None. See here, the indentions on                       
          the edges? Finger imprints.                             
The coroner places her fingers over the imprints.   Pantomimes    
bashing Derek's head in.                                          
                       CORONER (CONT'D)                           
          Whoever did this used their hands                       
          and a lot of strength and                               
          determination.                                          
              (re: face)                                          
          Then the party started.                                 
                      REGINA                                      
          Got any idea what the party favor                       
          was?                                                    
The coroner points them over Derek's mutilated face.              
                      CORONER                                     
          The cuts are super clean. Precise.                      
          Killer used a straight edge,                            
          possibly some kind of surgical tool.                    
          I've seen cuts like this from an                        
          amputation blade.                                       
                      ERIK                                        
          That's all you got?                                     
                                                          14.

                       CORONER                                    
          That's all I got.                                       
              (re: bagel)                                         
          Thanks for breakfast, detective.                        
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                         
Erik and Regina walk and talk.                                    
                      REGINA                                      
          We got as much out of that report as                    
          we had before. Nothing.                                 
                      ERIK                                        
          Forensics come back with anything?
                      REGINA                                      
          Came back with jack and shit. No
          fingerprints, hair, nada. But I did                     
          get something very interesting from
          one of their neighbors.
                      ERIK
          Someone saw what happened?
                      REGINA                                      
          No one saw a damn thing, but get                        
          this --
Regina stops walking.   Erik stops too, faces his partner.        
                      REGINA (CONT'D)                             
          -- their closest neighbor had this
          to say about the husband...
          Apparently "Mr. Mitchell routinely
          roughed up Mrs. Mitchell. And
          that's putting it politely."
                       ERIK
              (surprised)
          He beat her?
                      REGINA                                      
          She didn't mention that?
                        ERIK
          No.
                      REGINA                                      
          You know what that means, right? No
          forced entry. An abusive husband.                       
Erik leans back.    Sees where his partner is going with this.
                        REGINA (CONT'D)                           
          Motive.
Off Erik's look.

EXT. MITCHELL HOME - DAY
Sydney's car pulls into the driveway of Madison's house.
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
Madison looks warily at her house.    Sydney picks up on her
sister's discomfort.
                      SYDNEY
          You don't have to stay here.
                      MADISON
          Where else would I go?     Your couch?
                      SYDNEY
          Yes, you can crash with me for
          awhile. Or at mom's. I know she
          would love to have you.
Madison snorts a small, but derisive chuckle. Thinks for a
beat. She shouldn't say this, but says it anyway:
                      MADISON
          I bet she's happy Derek's finally
          out of my life.
                      SYDNEY
          Don't say that. Mom didn't like
          Derek, but she didn't want this.    No
          one did.
                      MADISON
          She stopped talking to me after the
          wedding.
                      SYDNEY
          Can you blame her, Madi? You walked
          down the aisle with a black eye.
          She couldn't bear to see you like
          that.
Madison tears up, embarrassed, ashamed.
                      MADISON
          I'm so stupid...
                      SYDNEY
          None of this is your fault.
Sydney sighs.   Looks around.
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Listen, let me stay here with you
          for a few days --
                       MADISON
          No.   I'll be fine. You should go.
                                                              16.

                      SYDNEY
          You shouldn't be alone right now.
                      MADISON
          This is my home, Syd. I'm not gonna
          let this be taken away from me too.
          I'll be OK, I promise.
Sydney relents.
                      SYDNEY
          Call me if you need anything.
They embrace.
                       MADISON
          Thank you.   I love you.
                      SYDNEY
          I love you too, sis.
Madison gets out of the car.   Sydney drives off.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DAY
Madison enters.   She takes in the house.   It feels cold and
empty.
She moves slowly through the house. Stops, and stares at the
floor. The spot where her husband died. Thankfully, it's
been cleaned. She fights back emotion, moving on.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Madison ascends the stairs, making her way to the master
bedroom. She passes the nursery, stops. Madison stands at
the threshold, unable to enter.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER
Madison sits alone at the dining table. An untouched
microwaved dinner and an opened laptop before her.
She stares blankly into space.   Quiet.   Somber.   Then --
-- reaches out and shuts her laptop, but not before we catch
a glimpse of headlines on the internet browser: "Dealing with
miscarriage", "Surviving traumas", etc.
INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
Independent, local grocery. It's late.    The EMPLOYEES are          
closing up for the night.                                            
UNKNOWN POV: at the end of the candy aisle. The POV PEEKS            
around the corner. There's a beautiful woman, 45, at the             
dairy case, deciding which almond milk she prefers. Let's            
call her JANE DOE for now.                                           
                                                          17.

                      STORE P.A. (V.O.)                          
          The store will be closing in ten                       
          minutes. Please finish all                             
          transactions. Thank you.                               
UNKNOWN POV: watching as Jane Doe makes a selection, hurrying    
to the CEREAL aisle.                                             
POV FOLLOWS, methodically stalking Jane Doe. She heads down      
the aisle, perusing the granola. POV SLIPS into the next         
aisle, peering through the shelves from a discreet distance.     
Even still. Jane Doe senses eyes on her. She looks around,       
trying to find where this uneasy feeling is coming from.         
                      STORE P.A. (V.O.)                          
          We will be closing in five minutes.                    
          Please finish all transactions.                        
UNKNOWN POV: Jane Doe shakes off the feeling. She grabs a        
bag of organic granola, a pack of protein bars and rushes to     
the counter.                                                     
After a beat the POV follows, watching her check out from the    
edge of the aisle, hidden. Unseen. Jane Doe pays, leaving.       
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                         
The parking lot is quite empty.
Jane Doe carries her grocery bags to her car, opens the          
trunk. Her back to us.
The POV seizes this opportunity and moves rapidly in on her,
ATTACKING Jane Doe from behind, knocking her out with a hard     
punch to the head. She's thrown into the opened trunk. The       
trunk door slams down.
A GLOVED HAND picks up her keys off the ground. The driver's
door opens, and the POV steps into the driver's seat of Jane     
Doe's car, a Ford Sedan, and fires up the engine.                
The car pulls away without anyone noticing what just
happened.
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - NIGHT
Darkness surrounds Madison's house.   Only one window on the
second floor is lit.
Directly across the street from Madison's house is a street
lamp. A car idles up into the pool of light. It's the FORD
SEDAN we just saw.
The DRIVER, whom we never see, watches the house silently.
                                                         18.

INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Madison comes out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair
with a towel. Just showered.
She stops, and stares at her husband's side of the bed. A
mixed feeling of melancholy and relief. And now she feels
guilty for feeling relief -- pushes on and turns the bed down
for the evening.
Behind her, out the window, the street lamp flickers off and
then back on. Madison looks over her shoulder.
She steps up to the window, peering down at the street below.
The only light is from the lamp across the street,
illuminating no further than the pool of light. THE FORD
SEDAN IS GONE.
She can't seem to shake the feeling that she's being watched.
The street lamp begins flickering, then the light cuts out
completely. Now it's dark. She stares, expecting a figure
to be standing there when the light comes back on.
After what feels like an eternity, the light zaps back on.
But no one there. Feeling unease, Madison draws the curtains
shut.
INT. ENTRANCE - NIGHT
She goes to the front door, and peeks out the eyehole,
checking. No one outside. She locks the door.
INT LIVING ROOM
She looks out the window of the living room, feeling
paranoid. Draws the curtains.
INT. KITCHEN
She locks the back door, then quickly backs away from it,
afraid that someone might appear in the window of the door.
She scans around her quiet, dark house, feeling like a
stranger in her own home.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Madison shuts the door to her bedroom, and locks it,
something she has never done before.
She downs a few sleeping pills with a glass of water on her
night stand, and climbs into bed. Lets be serious, this is
the only way she's going to be able to get any sleep.
She reaches out to the side lamp and hesitantly clicks off
the light.
                                                          19.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
Madison sleeps on her back. Tossing.    Turning.   Restless.     
She's finding no peace in her dreams.                            
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - INTERCUT                          
The front door is ajar. The UNKNOWN POV stands in the            
doorway. It moves... slowly, methodically, through the           
living room.                                                     
Madison flips over onto her side, curling into a ball. Her       
head presses into the pillow. She's agitated.                    
The UNKNOWN POV moves into the kitchen.    Standing over the     
stop where Derek died.                                           
A TEAR pools in Madison's eyes.   She's crying in her sleep.     
The UNKNOWN POV moves out of the kitchen, into the --            
HALLWAY                                                          
It slowly ascends the stairs.   Oh fuck.                         
                                                                 
It's coming for Madison.
Madison clenches her jaw, her fingernails digging into her       
arm. As if she's trying to wake herself.                         
The POV comes to the bedroom door.   It's OPEN.                  
But didn't Madison lock it?                                      
The UNKNOWN POV stands in the doorway, watching Madison          
asleep in bed. It creeps forward, until it's standing right      
over Madison --                                                  
MADISON SNAPS AWAKE.                                             
She's sweaty, panicked, breathing heavily. Was it a dream?       
She looks to the bedroom door, wide open. Pitch darkness         
yawns in the hallway outside. Madison is frozen in fear.         
She finally wills her limbs to move, turning on her bedside      
lamp. She stares at the darkness beyond the door.                
Anticipating someone stepping out of the dark. Are they          
approaching? There's nothing but silence from the house.         
She jumps out of bed, rushes to the door and slams the it        
shut. Terrified. She locks it. AGAIN. She takes a beat,          
calms down.                                                      
                      MADISON                                    
              (sotto)                                            
          There's nothing there. There's                         
          nothing there. It was a bad dream.                     
          It's in your head. It's all in your                    
          head.                                                  
                                                          20.

But then, from the other side of the door, the Killer taunts     
her in a disturbing sing-song...                                 
                       THE KILLER (O.S.)                         
          MADISON.   COME OUT AND PLAY.                          
Her blood runs cold. Madison backs away from the door, all       
the way to the other side of her bed. There's a gentle           
KNOCKING on the door.                                            
                      THE KILLER (O.S.) (CONT'D)                 
          YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME FOREVER.                        
She's frightened out of her wits. Madison's eyes fall on her     
night-stand. Erik's card. She quickly SNATCHES it, grabbing      
her cell phone. There's a LAUGH from the other side of the       
door. Mocking.                                                   
                      THE KILLER (O.S.) (CONT'D)                 
          HE CAN'T HELP YOU. NO ONE CAN.                         
                      MADISON                                    
          LEAVE ME ALONE! YOU'D BETTER GET                       
          THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! I'M                          
          CALLING THE COPS! THEY'LL BE HERE                      
          ANY MINUTE!                                            
The Killer laughs. And keeps laughing.     Madison grips her     
phone for dear life.                                             
                       ERIK                                      
              (sleepy, over the                                  
               phone)                                            
          Hello?                                                 
                      MADISON                                    
          Detective, he's here!    He's in my                    
          home!                                                  
The Killer laughs harder.    Louder.                             
                      MADISON (CONT'D)                           
          LEAVE ME ALONE!!!                                      
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - NIGHT                                       
Erik's car pulls into the driveway. He gets out, wearing         
sweatpants and a t-shirt, carrying his badge and a gun. He       
checks the front door. It's locked. He BANGS.                    
                      ERIK                                       
          MRS. MITCHELL! IT'S DETECTIVE SHAW!                    
No answer. The house is dark. Erik pulls a flashlight from       
his car. He moves around the house, heading to the back.         
                                                             21.

EXT. MITCHELL HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                              
Erik carefully makes his way around, gun in hand.     He comes      
into the back yard. He hears to the patio door.                     
                      ERIK                                          
          Mrs. Mitchell!                                            
                      MADISON                                       
          DETECTIVE SHAW!                                           
Erik looks up. Madison, panicked, terrified, peers out from         
her bedroom window on the second floor.                             
                      MADISON (CONT'D)                              
          He's in the hallway!                                      
                      ERIK                                          
          I'm coming in!                                            
Erik SHOOTS the lock off the patio door.   He enters.               
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                       
Flashlight aimed over his gun, Erik makes his way through the       
house. He moves through the kitchen.                                
                      ERIK                                          
          THIS IS THE POLICE. ANYONE INSIDE                         
          NEEDS TO COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS                         
          UP.                                                       
There's no answer.   He does a quick sweep of the --                
KITCHEN, moving to the --                                           
LIVING ROOM.   Nothing.                                             
Erik carefully heads up the stairs.                                 
INT. MITCHELL HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                   
Erik lands at the top.    The hallway is empty.                     
                      ERIK                                          
          Mrs. Mitchell I'm in the hallway.                         
He checks the nursery. The bathroom.     All empty.   Erik          
reaches the master bedroom door.                                    
                      ERIK (CONT'D)                                 
          Mrs. Mitchell. It's safe to come                          
          out now.                                                  
A beat. Madison slowly opens the door, peering out through          
the crack.                                                          
                      ERIK (CONT'D)                                 
          There's no one here.                                      
                                                            22.

She opens the door, throwing her arms around him.   She's          
beyond relived.                                                    
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - DAY                                           
Sydney's car pulls into the driveway. Sydney gets out,
carrying a casserole. She heads to the front door.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - NURSERY - DAY
Madison stands in the nursery, gently clutching her abdomen.
Her now-empty womb. She takes in the room, what will never
be. Sydney finds her.
                       SYDNEY
          Hey.
Madison JUMPS.
                       SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Sorry. You didn't answer the door,
          so I used my key.
              (re: casserole)
          Mom made this for you.
              (off her look)
          You okay?
Madison considers the question. Doesn't want Sydney to know
that she's NOT alright to be alone after all, brushes it off
and starts putting baby items/toys into a box.
                      MADISON
          Yeah, I'm cool. Working through it
          in my own way. I was just-- I need
          to take this stuff down.
                       SYDNEY
          Now?                                                     
                      MADISON
          If not now when? It's not like I'm
          going to be a mom.
                      SYDNEY
          That's bullshit. You can still have
          kids. Only next time it won't be
          with an abusive asshole.
Sydney can't believe she just blurted that out.   It hangs in
the air.
                      MADISON
          Well, there you go. Must be good to
          finally say it out loud.
                       SYDNEY
          Jesus.   I'm sorry, Madi.
Madison stares at the mobile.
                                                         23.

                       MADISON
          Don't be...
              (reflective)
          Once I got pregnant. I thought he'd
          really change. I was a fool.
              (beat)
          You know the night he died, he
          smashed my head against the wall.
                         SYDNEY
          What??!
Sydney looks horrified.
                      MADISON
          You know the reason I wanted her was
          because I thought, that if there was
          anything good that could come from
          all this pain it would be her. She
          was my little flame that kept me
          going. And finally I would be --
Madison cuts herself off before she says too much.
                      SYDNEY
          Would be what?
                      MADISON
          Would be biologically connected.
Sydney furrows her brow, confused.
                      SYDNEY
          What does that even mean?
                      MADISON
          I mean my baby and I would've been
          related by blood.
                      SYDNEY
          I'm sorry, Madi, you've lost me --
Madison agonizes over whether to spill the bean.   Fuck it.
                      MADISON
          I promised mom when we were young
          that I wouldn't tell you this, but --
          you and I are not related by blood.
              (beat)
          I'm -- adopted.
It hangs in the air.   Sydney is taken aback.
                         SYDNEY
          Wait what --
Madison nods.
                                                           24.

                      MADISON
          Your parents took me in when I was
          eight. I've no memories of my
          biological family before that. Mom
          and dad didn't know either. It was
          a blind adoption.
Sydney's trying to process this.   Off her dumbfounded look.
EXT. JEANNE'S HOME - DAY
Sydney's car pulls up to an old house situated on a big
parcel of land. Overgrown and unkempt.
We find JEANNE LAKE, late 60s, sitting in her wheelchair on
the porch. She's breathing through an oxygen mask, attached
to a tank. She smiles as she sees Sydney approaches.
                      JEANNE
          Sydney! I was hoping to see you.
          Did you give Madi the casserole?
                        SYDNEY
          I did.
                      JEANNE
          I'll have to get her more food.
          With all this stress I don't want
          her to forget to eat.
                      SYDNEY
          Mom. Why didn't you ever tell me
          Madison was adopted?
Jeanne's smile drops.   Knew this day would come.
                      JEANNE
          Because your father and I didn't
          think it mattered. She's still your
          sister.
                      SYDNEY
          Of course she's still my sister, but
          it matters to Madison! That was the
          only reason why she stuck around
          Derek -- to have a kid and have some
          kind of biological connection.
Jeanne bristles.   Sydney thinks, realizing something --
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Oh God, I'm thinking about all those
          times I've thrown tantrums and told
          her that mom and dad loved me more
          than her. Or that I was the better
          daughter with more awards and
          accolades.
Sydney laughs at the absurdity of it.   Slaps her forehead.
                                                        25.

                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Fuck, I didn't know. Christ. What
          a little shit I must have been.
          Can't even imagine how she must've
          felt.
Shame sets in.   Sydney feels awful.   Turns to mom.
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Why didn't you ever tell me the
          truth?
Jeanne takes a deep breath.
                       JEANNE
          Your father and I had wanted a child
          more than anything. We tried for
          the longest part, but after the
          third miscarriage, we decided to
          adopt.
              (smiling)
          When Madison came along, it was
          everything we had ever hoped for.
          She was the most incredible thing.
              (beat)
          But behind that beautiful, sweet
          smile, was a really sick kid.
          Before we took her in, she was under
          constant medical supervision.
          Practically grew up in a hospital or
          medical facility. So you can
          imagine what a difficult time she
          had adjusting to a normal life. It
          was rough.
              (looks at Sydney)
          But then you came along, and it
          changed everything. She adored you
          from the moment she set eyes on you,
          and for the first time, it snapped
          her out of the funk she was in.
Jeanne leans back and inhales a deep breath from her oxygen
mask.
                      JEANNE (CONT'D)
          And so Dad and I decided it was best
          to not bring up her troubled past.
          Let sleeping dogs lie.
                      SYDNEY
          How was she sick?
                      JEANNE
          We never really asked.
                      SYDNEY
          How could you not want to know about
          the health of the child you were
          adopting?
                                                          26.

                      JEANNE
          Because we wanted Madison so badly
          we just accepted her the way she
          was. We finally had a family, and
          nothing was going to change that.
Sydney processes all this, taking it in.
                      SYDNEY
          What do you know about her
          biological parents?
                      JEANNE
          Not much. The only thing the
          adoption agency told us was that her
          mother had Madison when she was very
          young.
INT. LOFT SPACE - DAY
CLOSE ON Jane Doe. Her eyes FLUTTER open. She comes to,           
blinking, trying to get her bearings. Confused, she looks         
around. She's in a tight, pitched space. The loft is filled       
with BOXES, a hint this is more of a storage space than           
living quarters. At the end of the bed is a bedpan. A few         
bottles of water. Her almond milk, granola and protein bars       
are still in their bag, on the floor.                             
To her horror she realizes her arms and legs are TIED DOWN to     
an old rusty bed.                                                 
Now she starts to panic.                                          
She tries to scream, but it's muffled.    Her mouth is GAGGED.    
                      THE KILLER (O.S.)                           
          DON'T BOTHER.                                           
Her eyes whips around, terrified. Her kidnapper, our Killer,      
emerges from the shadow in the corner. Wearing leather            
gloves and a hoodie the Killer's face is hidden by hair.          
(Note: unless otherwise stated the Killer's face is always        
obscured by hair, "The Ring"-style). He crouches before her.      
                      THE KILLER (CONT'D)                         
          EVEN IF YOU COULD SCREAM. NO ONE                        
          WOULD HEAR YOU.                                         
The Killer pulls out his AMPUTATION KNIFE. As the coroner         
guessed, the blade and the handle have been modified to make      
it an even more sharp, vicious weapon.                            
                      THE KILLER (CONT'D)                         
          I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW LONG I'VE                          
          WAITED FOR THIS. AFTER ALL, YOU WHO                     
          STARTED IT.                                             
Jane Doe shakes her head. No idea what he's talking about.        
The Killer runs the tip of the blade gently across Jane Doe's     
cheek. She winces, whimpering.                                    
                                                        27.

                       THE KILLER (CONT'D)                      
           BUT I MUST WAIT A LITTLE WHILE                       
           LONGER. NOW IS NOT YOUR TIME.                        
Tears are streaming down her face. She's SHAKING. Jane Doe      
tries to talk, tries to beg for her life, but nothing comes     
through the gag.                                                
                       THE KILLER (CONT'D)                      
           IT'S DOCTOR WEAVER'S.                                
Jane Doe's eyes go WIDE at the mention on the name.             
                       THE KILLER (CONT'D)                      
           YOU REMEMBER THE GOOD DOCTOR. GOOD.                  
           DR. WEAVER. SO KIND. SO CARING.                      
           SO EAGER TO HELP. I'D LIKE TO PAY                    
           HER BACK. WHERE WOULD ONE FIND DR.                   
           WEAVER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?                        
The killer places the tip of the blade underneath the Jane      
Doe's right eye. A gentle, threatening poke.                    
She better have an answer...                                    
EXT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY                                        
An upscale home in an affluent neighborhood. We're looking
through a window at a woman working on a computer.
INT. UPSCALE HOME - OFFICE - SAME TIME
The woman, DR. FLORENCE WEAVER, 60s, sits at her computer,
making notes in a medical research paper.
Her computer CHIMES a notification telling her she's got an     
URGENT email. Dr. Weaver clicks over to her EMAIL PAGE. The     
message at the top of her unopened emails says URGENT. There    
is no sender. Curious, she opens it.                            
Dr. Weaver reads, furrowing her brow.                           
                       DR. WEAVER                               
           "Hello, doc. Been a while. But now                   
           I've found you. I owe you one.                       
           Can't wait to see you again and show                 
           you what I've become."                               
That's weird. Maybe it's just spam. She deletes it.   She       
clicks back over to her research paper.                         
She makes notes, but after a beat she looks up. She feels       
like she's being watched. She looks outside, through the        
window across the yard. Nobody around.                          
Huh.   She goes back to work.                                   
                                                         28.

EXT. MITCHELL HOME - NIGHT
We're back watching Madison's house from across the street.
Again, that damn street lamp begins to flicker.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - NURSERY - NIGHT
Madison is gathering strewn clothing and throwing them into a
laundry basket.
She's lost in her thoughts when the LIGHTS AROUND HER
FLICKER. Madison looks around, baffled. The flickering
gives her a slight, tingling headache.
Then the flickering stops. Everything back to normal.
Making nothing of it, she leaves the room with her laundry.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Madison paces down the hallway to the stairs. Adjusting the
laundry basket to her side so she can see the steps.
As she looks down to navigate the steps, A FIGURE CROSSES HER
PATH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS walking into the living
room.
Madison looks up, startled. She halts halfway down the
flight of stairs. Did someone just walked into the living
room?
INT. MITCHELL HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
She steps down into the hallway downstairs, and makes her way
to the living room. On guard. Slowly, peering around the
corner. Sees no one. Checks around. Empty of another soul.
Blood drips onto her clothing in the laundry basket she's
holding. Her nose is bleeding.
                      MADISON
          Shit.
She grabs a hand towel from the basket, and wipes her nose.
She hurries off.
INT. LAUNDRY - CONTINUOUS
She enters the laundry room, opens the front-loading washer
and throws the bloodied towel in. Then, she stuffs the rest
of her laundry into the machine.
Her headache returns, but tries not to let it distract her
from her chore, but then --
-- Something catches her attention, something moving through
the glass of the washer door. She looks and sees --
                                                          29.

THE FACE OF A TERRIFIED WOMAN, on the other side of the glass
door. Eyes brimming with fear. SHE SCREAMS A BLOODCURDLING
SCREAM.
Madison yelps in fright, falls back, scuttling backwards out
of the laundry room. Madison freaks out.
We recognize this woman.    It's DR. WEAVER.
                         DR. WEAVER
             What are you doing in my house?! HOW
             DID YOU GET IN MY HOUSE.
From BESIDE MADISON a DARK FIGURE steps forward, as if he
emerged from thin air. It's the Killer. The same figure who      
killed Madison's husband. We don't see his face. But Dr.         
Weaver does and she's FUCKING TERRIFIED.
                                                    Something
Madison wants to run, but she's FROZEN in place.
in her is too scared to move.
Rooted to the spot CAMERA PANS around Madison. The scene         
changing from the interior of her house to the interior of       
DR. WEAVER'S OFFICE. It's like Madison's been transported.       
Dr. Weaver sits at her desk, utterly shocked by what she's       
looking at.                                                      
                         DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)                     
             How?                                                
Madison watches, helpless, as the Killer ATTACKS, LUNGING for    
Dr. Weaver, grabbing her by her neck. With inhuman strength      
he LIFTS Dr. Weaver out of her chair like she weighed            
nothing. Dr. Weaver KICKS, her feet trying to find purchase.     
Dr. Weaver gets her foot on the edge of her desk PUSHING OFF.    
It throws them off balance. Dr. Weaver and the killer FALL,      
hitting the floor hard.                                          
Dr. Weaver wastes no time. She's UP, KICKING the killer          
right in the gut. The Killer grunts, doubling over. When         
she tries to run he GRABS her leg, pulling her down. She         
kicks out again, nailing him in the face. She gets her leg       
free, RUNNING.                                                   
The Killer gets up, giving chase.                                
ON MADISON                                                       
She has no idea what's going on, but it's like she's being       
pulled along as the Killer chases Dr. Weaver through the         
                                                                 
house. Though Madison is stationary, it's as if the house is
moving UNDERNEATH HER.                                           
Dr. Weaver runs through the --                                   
LIVING ROOM.                                                     
                                                            30.

She knocks over a side table, SCREAMING her head off as she        
rounds into the --                                                 
DINING ROOM.                                                       
Beelining for the --                                               
KITCHEN.                                                           
Each room surges around Madison. She grips her stomach,            
gagging, getting motion sickness from the sudden movements.        
Dr. Weaver rounds the island in the center of the kitchen.         
The Killer traps her there.                                        
                         DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)                       
             What do you want? What do you want                    
             from me?                                              
                         THE KILLER                                
             I WANT WHAT YOU TOOK FROM ME.                         
Dr. Weaver tries to run but the Killer GRABS her by her hair,      
YANKING her back.                                                  
Madison watches, rooted to the spot, as the Killer wraps his       
hands around Dr. Weaver's neck. His hand covering her mouth,       
stifling her cries.
ON MADISON
Her eyes dart down, catching a GLIMMER. The Killer grips the       
AMPUTATION KNIFE in his hand. He holds the tip of the blade        
next to Dr. Weaver's nose. Madison's eyes go wide as he
slices into Dr. Weaver's nose, cutting it off.
Dr. Weaver tries to cry out but the Killer grips her face so       
hard she can barely speak. The Killer keeps slicing, cutting       
off Dr. Weaver's lips.
ON MADISON                                                         
She shuts her eyes, as the Killer mutilates Dr. Weaver.            
                         THE KILLER (CONT'D)                       
             MADISON.
She opens her eyes...
The room is empty. There's no Killer. No Dr. Weaver. It's          
like they were never there. Madison breathes, able to move
again. She looks around the room, exhausted.
Holy shit.    Is she losing her mind?
EXT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY                                           
An old, beat-up car pulls along the curb.      The HOUSEKEEPER,    
40s, gets out.                                                     
                                                            31.

She pulls her cleaning supplies from the trunk, business as         
usual. She makes her way up the drive to the front door.            
She's about to let herself in when she sees --                      
The door is slightly open.    Curious, the housekeeper pushes       
it open.

          Dr. Weaver?     Are you home?                             
The house keeper sees the overturned side table.     She follows    
the path to the kitchen...                                          
Where she sees Dr. Weaver's mutilated body.      She SCREAMS,       
rushing out of the house.

Erik and Regina sit at their desks, digging into bags of fast       
food. LIEUTENANT DANIELS, Erik and Regina's boss, steps up          
to them.

INT. UPSCALE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY
Erik and Regina step into a flurry of activity. In the              
corner a YOUNG OFFICER questions the distraught housekeeper.

          Vic is Dr. Florence Weaver.     Perp                      
          came through the back door.                               
Erik and Regina follow the female officer.                          
INT. UPSCALE HOUSE - MUD ROOM - DAY                                 
A TECH waits patiently. The female officer shows them the           
shoe prints leading out the back door. The DOOR HANDLE has          
been broken off. There's evidence tape squaring off the             
prints.

          there's a match.                                       
INT. UPSCALE HOME - OFFICE - DAY                                 
Erik and Regina enter. Dr. Weaver's office has been turned       
inside out, papers and files strewn everywhere. It looks
like someone tore the room apart, searching for something.
FORENSIC TECHS, wearing gloves and booties, carefully canvass
the room.                                                        
Dr. Weaver's dead body is against the wall, her face maimed
and sewn shut, just like Derek.
Erik looks over Dr. Weaver's body. Her dead eyes stare into
nothing. A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER stands over it, snapping
photos, the M.E. off to the side.                                
                      M.E.
          I'm guessing the perp killed her and
          then tore the room apart.

          Place is a mess. Robbery?                              
                      FEMALE OFFICER                             
          He's a shit thief if it was.   There                   
          were money and jewels in the                           
          bedroom.                                               
Erik's eyes land on the bookshelf. On the shelves are rows
of THICK FOLDERS, tightly packed together. Something catches
Erik's eye. It seems ONE FOLDER IS MISSING.
                      ERIK
          Gloves.
A tech hands him a pair of plastic gloves. Erik slips them
on. He pulls out one of the folders, flips through the
pages. It's a MEDICAL JOURNAL. He pulls out another, more
detailed medical journal.                                        
                                                          33.

Erik wonders what's in the one that is missing. He notices
something stuck in the back of the shelf. He reaches in and
pulls out a PHOTO.
                      REGINA                                     
          What'cha got?
Erik holds up the photo. It's old, worn, black and white. A
FEMALE CHILD, 7, wears a hospital gown, staring into camera
blankly. Sad. He flips it over. Written on the back of the
photo in faded pencil is: `92, EMILY MAY.                        
                      REGINA (CONT'D)

          reconstructive surgery.                                
Erik rolls something around in his mind.    Regina sees it.

          The killer wasn't after money. He                      
          was after something in these                           
          journals. Look, a year is missing:                     
          `92. Whoever did this was looking                      
          for something in that file.

          You're gonna go through all of this?                   
Erik shoots her a wide, shit-eating grin.

CLOSE ON a MEDICAL JOURNAL lying on a workbench.   It's the      
missing journal from Dr. Weaver's office.

Jane Doe, face puffy, eyes red from crying, watches, still

The Killer flips through the pages, searching for something.           
There are GLIMPSES of the pages. Medical NOTES. SKETCHES of            
a surgical procedure. The Killer turns the page, landing on            
another image of EMILY.

There are a list of NAMES.   We recognize one as Dr. Weaver's.         
The Killer runs his finger down the list, stopping by one:

Madison is bundled under a blanket, working on her laptop.        A
search engine is up on the screen. Madison is researching
STRESS INDUCED HALLUCINATIONS. She clicks on a link: HOW
ANXIETY CAN CREATE WAKING DREAMS.
She's reading, when the doorbell rings. Madison JUMPS at the
sound. She's tense, on edge. The doorbell rings again.
Madison moves to the door, but doesn't open it. After a
beat, KEYS enter the lock. The door OPENS --
It's Sydney, letting herself in.   She's carrying bags of
GROCERIES.
                      SYDNEY
          Hey. Got you some groceries.
          Thought I'll make you your fav dish
          tonight, what'd say??
Madison reaches out, poking her sister's shoulder to make
sure she's real. When Madison makes the physical connection
she finally relaxes. Sydney eyes her sister.

Madison takes the grocery bags, heading into the kitchen.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Madison and Sydney move around the kitchen, cooking. For the    
first time they're relaxed, chill. Both in their element.       
Cooking an activity they've always enjoyed together. From       
the living room the TV plays in the background.

          for the first time and the grease                     
          from the skillet caught fire? You                     
          thought it was a good idea to throw                   
          water on it?

          That was the first time.     Then came                
          Memorial Weekend.                                     
                      MADISON                                   
          When you decided to test exactly how                  
          flame retardant mom's new drapes                      
          were?                                                 
Sydney laughs.                                                  
                      SYDNEY                                    
          They weren't. Not at all. Hey,                        
          blame the sales guy. He lied to us.                   
                      MADISON                                   
          Or, you were a little pyro and you                    
          couldn't admit it.                                    
They both laugh.   Sydney eyes her sister.                      
                        MADISON (CONT'D)                        
          What?                                                 
                      SYDNEY                                    
          Nothing. It's just... it's good to                    
          see you smile again.                                  
Madison considers it.   Everything that's happened.             
                       MADISON                                  
          It feels good.                                        
              (beat, then)                                      
          I'm happy you're here, Syd.                           
                                                            36.

                      NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)                           
          Breaking news tonight about a home                       
          invasion in Wilshire Park. Police                        
          are reporting the body of Dr.                            
          Florence Weaver was found in her                         
          home this afternoon.                                     
This gets Madison's attention. She stops chopping, looking         
toward the TV. She moves to the --                                 
LIVING ROOM.                                                       
On the TV SCREEN is a smiling, professional headshot of Dr.        
Weaver. Madison's heart catches in her throat. She                 
recognizes Dr. Weaver from her nightmarish vision.                 
                      NEWS ANCHOR                                  
          Police have released few details as                      
          the investigation is pending. Dr.                        
          Weaver was an active member of the                       
          community and prominent surgeon.                         
          Widowed, she leaves behind two adult                     
          children.                                                
OFF Madison, realizing it wasn't hallucinating at all--            
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
Madison PUKES into the toilet.
Sydney knocks on the door.
                       SYDNEY
          Madison?
              (tries the handle)
          C'mon, let me in.
Madison unlocks the bathroom door.    Sydney slides down,
sitting next to her sister.
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          Did you know her?
Madison shakes her head.
                         MADISON
          No, I don't.     But I saw her die.
                      SYDNEY
          What do you mean?
                      MADISON
          I saw her getting murdered. I don't
          know how -- I was doing laundry
          here last night, and then suddenly,
          I -- I saw him killing her. It was
          him, Syd.
                                                             37.

                      SYDNEY
          You saw the killer -- the same
          person who attacked you?
                       MADISON
          Yes.
                      SYDNEY
          He was here?!
                      MADISON
          No! I saw him murdering her in her
          house. I don't know how, but
          somehow I saw what he was doing --
          over at her house!
Madison loses it, breaking down, crying.
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          What's happening to me, Syd?
Sydney has no answer, just as confused. The only thing she
can do is hold her sister, comforting her.
                      SYDNEY
          It's going to be okay.
OFF Sydney's uncertain look, knowing that's not true --
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - NIGHT
The bullpen is dark, empty save for Regina and Erik sitting         
at their desks, pouring over the files they retrieved from          
Dr. Weaver's house. There are several cups of coffee and            
fast food wrappers between them. Erik is deep in pile of            
files. Regina rubs the bridge of her nose, tired.                   
                       REGINA                                       
              (taps the desk)                                       
          That's it. I'm out. I can't keep                          
          any of this shit straight. My brain                       
          feels like it's about to push                             
          through my eyeballs.                                      
                      ERIK                                          
          Tell Marcus I said hello.                                 
                      REGINA                                        
          He's gonna be pissed at you, you                          
          know. Tonight was our date night.                         
                      ERIK                                          
          I'll make it up to him.                                   
                      REGINA                                        
          I doubt that unless you're gonna                          
          wear the silk panties I bought.                           
Erik laughs.   Not gonna happen.   Regina grabs her stuff.          
                                                          38.

                         REGINA (CONT'D)                         
             We both want to catch this asshole                  
             but you look how I feel. Don't stay                 
             too late.                                           
Erik nods.    She leaves.                                        
Erik flips through the medical files. He's tired, starting       
to fade. He stands, stretching. He reaches for the coffee        
pot but it's EMPTY. He makes a fresh pot. As he waits, his       
attention falls on the photo of EMILY. It's upside down.         
The image distorted in the jaundiced light of the bullpen.       
Erik turns it around, facing him. The photo looks normal.        
Emily's young face stares back at him. Erik gets an idea.        
                          ERIK                                   
                 (calls out)                                     
             HEY, PROBASCO! YOU HERE?                            
From somewhere deep in the precinct a voice calls back.          
                         ANDY (O.S.)                             
             YEAH?                                               
Erik picks up the photo, heading down the hall.                  
INT. PRECINCT - ANDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            
Erik enters. ANDREW PROBASCO, 30s, DnD nerd-type, sits at        
his desk, photoshopping a photo of a grungy white male on his    
tablet. There are images of the guy with a beard, bald, he's     
older, etc. Andy is the police photo analyst.                    
                         ANDY                                    
             Thought I was the only one here.                    
                         ERIK                                    
             Got this case. Nothing's adding up.                 
             Need a favor.                                       
                         ANDY                                    
             Sure.                                               
Erik hands him the photo of Emily.                               
                         ANDY (CONT'D)                           
             Victim?                                             
                         ERIK                                    
             Not sure yet. Can you age that up?                  
                         ANDY                                    
             How old you need?                                   
                         ERIK                                    
             Thirties. And if you can have it by                 
             morning your next case of beer is on                
             me.                                                 
                                                         39.

          Will do.                                               
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - NIGHT                                       
The street light across from Madison's house begins to
flicker.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Sydney sleeps on the couch.   Restless.
The night-light starts to zap.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Meanwhile, Madison is fast asleep in the master bedroom.
There's a bottle of sleep medication on the night-stand next     
to a glass of water.
We stay on her as she sleeps for a beat, before she turns
onto her side, facing her husband's side of the bed. The
empty side. She gets a weird feeling, her eyes flutter open
and sees --
AN OLD MAN'S FACE UP CLOSE.   Sleeping in bed next to her.
She screams but no sound comes out. She tries to move, but
can't. She's in that frozen state, like she's having sleep
paralysis, but is wide awake.
The window behind her unlatches on its own, and creaks open.
SOMETHING CRAWLS IN THROUGH THE WINDOW. Of course Madison
can't see what is happening behind her.
Suddenly, Madison feels a presence hovering above her.   She
can't turn her head to look, so her pupils dart to the
corners of her eyes, upwards, seeing --
A DARK FIGURE clambering over her like an insect in slow-
motion, out of focus. Actually, more like a spider
descending upon it's prey. Limbs bend in odd angles. He's
so close, she can smell his putrid breath and hear his raspy
breathing. Madison is beyond terrified.
This is our KILLER. His long hair covers his face. He
lunges at the old man, startling him awake with a fright.
As he tries to scream, the killer muffles his mouth and STABS
HIM REPEATEDLY.
Madison watches the horror, helplessly -- eyes tearing up,
head pounding with pain.
The killer stops stabbing, then turns to look at Madison as
though he just noticed her there. Through the part in his
long hair, Madison finally makes out his face. Their eyes
connect. The pain in Madison's head grows. Her nose bleeds.
                                                          40.

The killer leers at her, and brings a finger up to his lips,
"shhhhh..."
Madison fights her paralysis. She begins moving -- first her
fingers, then her hands -- pushing herself to sit up. But
now her headache is searing, like a burning cattle prod was
shoved into her brain. Finally --
She passes out, collapsing backwards and crashing out of bed.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER
Sydney sleeps away downstairs, unaware what her sister was
going through upstairs.
A SHADOW CROSSES THE WINDOW OUTSIDE, behind Sydney.
She's still sleeping soundly. But then a noise stirs her
awake. She sits up. Turns on a side light. Looks around.
The house is still. Then a thump.
Sydney gets up. Moving around the house, searching for the
source of the sound. It's possibly coming from upstairs.
                           SYDNEY
             Madi??
INT. MITCHELL HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
She hurries up the stairs and makes her way to Madison's
door. It's locked. Sydney bangs on the door and calls out.
                           SYDNEY
             Madison??
No answer.    Sydney starts to freak out.
                           SYDNEY (CONT'D)
             MADISON.    OPEN THE DOOR.
Sydney shoulders the door -- again and again -- finally
smashing it open and seeing an empty bed.
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sydney scans around, panicking. It's freezing in here. She
notices the window is opened, the sheer billowing in the
night wind. She goes to shut the window and then --
Madison SNAPS UPWARDS, SITTING UPRIGHT on the floor next to
the bed. Finally she's able to scream and move, so she
screams her lungs out whilst fighting off an invisible force.
Sydney runs up to her.
                         SYDNEY
             Madison! Wake up!
                         MADISON
             HE'S HERE! HE'S HERE!!
                                                        41.

Sydney looks around, frightened and confused.
                      SYDNEY
          Who -- there's no one, Madi!   You
          were dreaming.
Madison scans the room, but sees there's no one else with
them. She grabs her head. The pain is mild now.
                       MADISON
          I wasn't dreaming! I saw him!
              (looks Sydney in the
               eyes)
          He killed again, Sydney. And this
          time... I saw his face.
OFF Sydney's fearful look...
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY
Madison and Sydney sit across from Erik and Regina.            
                      REGINA                                   
          What do you mean you're seeing the
          murders?
                      MADISON
          Somehow I'm seeing his murders.
          Like he's showing them to me.
                      ERIK
          He's sending you videos?
                      MADISON
          No, Goddammit. I see them. As                        
          they're happening. It's like -- I'm
          there, at the scene of the killings.
                      ERIK
          You mean, like -- "psychically"??
                      MADISON
          I know it sounds crazy, but I have
          no other explanation for it.
                      REGINA                                   
          Are you fucking with us right now?
                      SYDNEY
          Why's it so hard to believe? Don't
          you guys use psychics for, like,
          missing person cases?
                       REGINA                                  
              (incredulously)
          No, we don't!
                                                       42.

                      SYDNEY
          Maybe when the killer attacked
          Madison they formed some kind of
          psychic bond.
Regina leans back on her chair, huffing to Erik --             
                      REGINA                                   
          This is ridiculous -- why are we
          listening to this?
Erik tries to take this seriously, looks to Madison.
                      ERIK
          So tell me, what did you see in your
          vision?
                        REGINA                                 
          Christ.
                      MADISON
          I "saw" him killing another person
          last night. An elderly man. While
          he was sleeping in bed.
                        ERIK
          Where?
                       MADISON
          I don't know. I don't have an
          address. But I did see something
          out his window. A red neon sign.
              (remembering)
          I think it said "Silvercup."
Erik digests this, turns to Regina.                            
                      ERIK
          Put a word out to all units, call
          the appropriate signage companies --
          find this sign.
Regina throws her hands in the air.                            
                      REGINA                                   
          It's gonna take awhile.
                        SYDNEY
          We'll wait.
Sydney smiles, folds her arms. Regina stares daggers at her    
as she gets up. Erik watches his partner walk off to the       
communication department, then turns his attention back to
Madison and Sydney.
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          If there's nothing there, then we're
          lying, lock us up.

                                                        43.
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          If there is, you have a serial
          killer on your hands, Detective.
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - LATER
Erik is trying to work, but gets distracted by Sydney playing
with the drinking bird toy on his desk. She catches him
looking at her.
                         SYDNEY
          Sorry...
She backs away.
                       SYDNEY (CONT'D)
              (under her breath)
          ...don't mean to play with your
          bird.
Erik can't help but smiles. Sydney smiles back. A little
unspoken moment between the two. Whatever is going on here
is broken with the arrival of Regina.                            
                      REGINA                                     
          A red neon "Silvercup" sign is an
          apartment building down in Boyle
          Heights.
Madison perks up, excitedly.
                        MADISON
          That's it.    It's across from it.
EXT. SILVERCUP APARTMENT - DAY
Regina's car pulls up. We're in an old, industrial part of       
town. A BLACK AND WHITE POLICE CRUISER parks behind him, two
UNIFORMED OFFICERS in the front.
Erik, Regina, Sydney and Madison get out of the car. They        
look across the street from the Silvercup building at a five-
story apartment complex. An old, art deco building.
                      REGINA                                     
          What -- we're gonna knock on every
          fucking door??
Erik seems daunted by that too.
                         MADISON
          No.     Top floor.
                       REGINA                                    
              (sarcastically)
          Oh, much better.
              (to the uniformed
               officers)
          Keep an eye on these two.
                                                            44.

The officers nod.    Erik and Regina strive off.                   
INT. SILVERCUP APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LATER                         
Erik and Regina are on opposite ends of the halfway knocking       
on apartment doors. Regina's agitated.                             
                       REGINA                                      
           We should've sent uniforms for this.                    
           At least that way we wouldn't be                        
           wasting our time.                                       
                       ERIK                                        
           She gave us a lead.                                     
                       REGINA                                      
           You can't possibly tell me you                          
           believe that story. She gave us a                       
           fantasy and sent us on a goddamn                        
           snipe hunt.                                             
Regina moves on.    She KNOCKS and the door OPENS slightly.        
                         REGINA (CONT'D)                           
           Hello?    Anybody home?                                 
There's no answer.    Regina trades a look with Erik.              
                       ERIK                                        
           Seems suspicious to me.                                 
He NODS.   Go in.   They pull their guns.                          
                       REGINA                                      
           This is the police. If anyone is in                     
           there I need you let us know.                           
Silence.   Regina pushes open the door.     They carefully step    
inside.                                                            
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                                        
Regina and Erik make their way inside, guns ready. The             
apartment is quiet. Regina and Erik check the rooms, coming        
to the bedroom door --                                             
Where they see the DEAD BODY, mutilated, blood covering the        
bedsheets. It's a gruesome scene. Regina lowers her gun.           
Madison was right.                                                 
                       REGINA                                      
           Motherfucker.
INT. APARTMENT - LATER
The apartment is now a crime scene.    Erik stands with Regina     
and the M.E.
                                                            45.

                       M.E.
          Same style, pattern. Good guess
          it's the same weapon. I'd say this
          was our guy.
A UNIFORMED OFFICER comes up, landing next to them.
                      UNIFORMED OFFICER
          Name is Victor Field. Divorced.
          Three adult kids. Both live out of                       
          state. Owns a pharmaceutical
          business.
                      ERIK
          Sydney was right.     This is a serial
          killer.
                        REGINA                                     
          Yes, it is.    It's her sister.
Erik refuses to believe that.    It doesn't add up.
                       ERIK
          No way.   That's too easy.
He storms off with a purpose.
                      REGINA                                       
          Hey -- where you going??
EXT. SILVERCUP APARTMENT - DAY
Erik marches up to Madison and Sydney, still with the
uniformed officers. Sydney is super curious.
                      SYDNEY
          Did you find him? Is he -- dead?
Erik reluctantly nods. Sydney gasps, awestruck.       Madison's
heart sinks. Erik turns to her.
                      ERIK
          You said you saw his face in your
          vision?
Madison nods, warily.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          I want you to sit with our sketch
          artist. I want to know what he
          looks like.
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY
Madison sits with a bookish looking SKETCH ARTIST, who's
sketching away. Sydney sits next to Madison, giving moral
support but can't help feeling a tinge of excitement.
                                                            46.

                         MADISON
             No, no -- the eyes are more askew...
             Kind of deformed...
MONTAGE: Madison gives instructions. Pencil scratching on
the page, drawing rapidly. A face taking shape.
                           MADISON (CONT'D)
             Protruding,   like they were
             swollen...
             His hair is   longer... black...
             framing his   face... yes...
             And crooked   teeth... sharper...
Madison visibly shakes as the killer's face forms on the
page.
FLASHCUT: to a CLOSE UP of the Killer's face snarling at us.
ON MADISON
Reeling from this flashback image.
Meanwhile, Erik and Regina are a few feet away, watching all       
this and conferring amongst themselves.
                         ERIK
             She came to us. She told us about
             Victor Fields.
                         REGINA                                    
             Exactly. Think about it, how does                     
             she know this guy's dead? Cause
             she's had "visions"? She's a
             fucking psychic? No, she's a
             psychopath. I'd bet my left tit she                   
             came to us with this bullshit so she
             can pull an insanity plea.
                         ERIK
             None of this adds up.   It's too
             obvious.
                         REGINA                                    
             This isn't calculus. It's common
             sense. Sometimes reality stares us
             in the face, and we're too busy
             trying to be clever.                                  
ON MADISON
Staring at the drawing, frightened.      She calls out to the
detectives.
                           MADISON
             That's him.
Erik and Regina approach.      Erik grabs the sketch-pad,          
studying the drawing.                                              
                                                           47.

A part in the long hair reveals a sliver of a freakish face.
Deformed. Bulging Eye. Jagged teeth.
                      REGINA                                      
          Awesome. So we're putting out a                         
          BOLO on Sloth from the Goonies.                         
Regina takes the drawing, and marches off.     Madison rises.     
                       MADISON
          Excuse me.   Where's the restroom?
                      ERIK
          Down the hall. Second door to the
          right.
She goes, leaving Sydney alone with Erik. Erik takes a seat
at his desk. He feels Sydney's eyes on him.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          So Ms. Lake, you have the advantage
          of knowing what I do for a living.
          But I don't know what you do.
                      SYDNEY
          I'm a professor of psychology at UT.
                     ERIK
          Oh wow. You're really young to be a
          professor. You must be really good?
Erik smiles.   Is this flirting or a challenge?   Sydney takes
it as both.
                       SYDNEY
          I'd like to think I'm good at my
          job.
              (sizing him up)
          Let me guess... You did one semester
          at an institute of higher learning.
          Dropped out because you were ready
          for the real world. Bounced around
          doing odd jobs here and there, but
          your life was going nowhere and you
          knew it.
                      ERIK
          So you're gonna tell me I needed to
          feel important and the quickest way
          to do that was to get a badge?
                      SYDNEY
          No. That's your partner. You're
          the boy scout. You were the kid
          always helping wounded animals.
          Altruism is what drives you. Always
          has, even if you don't realize it.
          You're the guy who becomes a cop
          because he thinks he can make a
          difference, detective.
                                                         48.

Erik reacts.   She's pretty much nailed him.
                      ERIK
          You're good. If you ever need to
          make some extra money we could
          always use a profiler, Ms. Lake.
          Much easier to sell than psychics.
Sydney laughs.
                      SYDNEY
          You guys won't be able to afford me.
          And you can call me Sydney.
Erik smiles.
                        ERIK
          Ok, Sydney.
INT. PRECINCT - RESTROOM - DAY
Madison splashes water on her face.   Looks at herself in the
mirror. Feeling fatigued. Then --
-- the florescent tube-lights around her start to zap.
Madison's head begins to hurt. She's getting used to the
signs. Something is happening. She scans around, expecting
another vision. But nothing comes. Instead her cellphone
buzzes.
She fishes the phone out of her pocket, checking the caller
ID. It's an BLOCKED NUMBER. Nervously, she answers.              
                        MADISON
          Hello?
There's a CRACKLE on the other end of the line. Electric
static. Then, a deep, slithering voice on the other end.
                      VOICE
          HELLO, EMILY.
Madison's too stunned to respond.
                      VOICE (CONT'D)
          YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME, DO YOU?   I'M
          HURT.
Madison takes awhile to find the courage to speak.
                      MADISON
          My name is Madison.
                      VOICE
          NO, IT'S NOT. YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR
          NAME, CHANGE YOUR LIFE. BUT YOU'LL
          ALWAYS BE EMILY TO ME.
                                                              49.

                         MADISON
          Who are you?
                      VOICE
          YOU KNOW. DEEP DOWN. YOU ABANDONED
          ME. TURNED ON ME. YOU LET THEM
          TELL YOU I WAS BAD. YOU DIDN'T LOVE
          ME ANYMORE. BUT I NEVER STOPPED
          LOVING YOU.
                      MADISON
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.
                      VOICE
          THEY HURT US. THEY TORE US APART,
          TOOK YOU AWAY FROM ME. BUT I FOUND
          MY WAY BACK TO YOU. NOW I'M GOING
          TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID.
          ONE. BY. ONE.
                      MADISON
          GABRIELLE, NO!!                                            
Madison catches herself -- holy fuck she knows her name!             
                  The Killer is a woman.                             
And it's a HER.
On the other end of the line, the Voice, the Killer, now             
known as GABRIELLE, laughs.                                          
                      GABRIELLE                                      
          SEE? I TOLD YOU. DEEP DOWN YOU
          KNOW WHO I AM. YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
          I'D COME BACK.
                         MADISON
          Please stop.     Please --
                      GABRIELLE                                      
          OH, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.
A chill runs down her spine.       Madison's phone SIZZLES,          
SPARKING. It's fried.                                                
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY
Madison, nervous, beelines for Sydney.                               
                      MADISON                                        
          Are we done here?                                          
Regina trades a look with Erik.      Something's up.                 
                      REGINA                                         
          You got somewhere you need to be?                          
                      MADISON                                        
          I'm just tired.                                            
                                                       50.

                      REGINA                                   
          You sure there's nothing else you                    
          want to tell us.                                     
                       MADISON                                 
          No.  I told you everything.                          
              (to Sydney)                                      
          Take me home, please.                                
Sydney senses her sister's urgency. She grabs their things,    
following Madison. Erik and Regina watch them leave.           
                      REGINA                                   
          You still think she's innocent?                      
Erik considers the question, unsure of his answer.             
Lieutenant Daniels steps out of his office.                    
                       LIEUTENANT DANIELS                      
          Moss.   Got a second?                                
Regina heads off, crossing with Andy.                          
                      ANDY                                     
          Got that image you wanted.                           
Andy hands Erik the original photo of Emily and the printed    
photo he aged up to her 30s. Andy leaves. Erik stares at       
it, looking troubled. The aged up image looks like Madison.    
                       ERIK                                    
              (sotto)                                          
          You knew the doctor.                                 
              (beat, then)                                     
          Fuck.                                                
Regina is coming back. Erik quickly puts the images away.      
Regina sits at her desk. She sees Erik looks troubled.         
                      REGINA                                   
          What got up your ass?                                
                       ERIK                                    
          This case.   It's fucked up at every                 
          turn.                                                
                      REGINA                                   
          It's fucked up cause you don't want                  
          to accept the truth.                                 
INT. CAR - DAY - MOVING                                        
Sydney is driving.   Madison in the passenger seat.
                      SYDNEY
          What's going on, Madi?
                      MADISON
          She called me.                                       
                                                        51.

                        SYDNEY
          Who?                                                 
                      MADISON
          I just spoke with her in the                         
          restroom.
Sydney is surprised.
                      SYDNEY                                   
          It's a woman? We gotta turn around,                  
          and tell Erik.                                       
                      MADISON                                  
          His partner hates me, she doesn't                    
          believe me.                                          
                      SYDNEY                                   
          We can trace the call.      See where it             
          came from.                                           
Madison shows Sydney her phone.    It's a burnt husk.          
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)                          
          What the hell happened?                              
                       MADISON                                 
          She did this.                                        
              (off her look)                                   
          See? It sounds crazy.       The cops                 
          won't believe me.                                    
                      SYDNEY                                   
          But we can call service provider,                    
          they have to have that information.                  
                      MADISON                                  
          No -- we can't.                                      
                        SYDNEY                                 
          Why not?                                             
Madison thinks.   Not quite sure what she knows.               
                        MADISON                                
          I know her.    Her name is Gabrielle.                
Sydney's jaw hangs open.   Shocked.
                      MADISON (CONT'D)                         
          I don't know how I knew, but talking                 
          to her... I just did. She said they                  
          tore us apart. And now she's going                   
          to make them pay. She spoke like we                  
          have a history together.
                      SYDNEY
          And you don't know anything else                     
          about this woman?                                    
                                                            52.

                      MADISON
          I don't remember. But I know who                         
          might. Take me to see mom.
INT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - DAY
Jeanne sits in her wheelchair, watching tv. The door opens.        
Sydney enters, followed by Madison. Jeanne's face lights up        
when she sees her daughter.                                        
                      JEANNE                                       
          Maddy.                                                   
Jeanne tries to her out of her chair.                              
                      MADISON                                      
          It's okay, mom. Sit.                                     
But Jeanne makes the effort, using all her strength to stand,      
hug her daughter. Jeanne holds her tight. She's relieved,          
grateful to see her.                                               
                       JEANNE                                      
          I'm so happy you're all right.                           
              (beat, then)                                         
          I'm so sorry about the baby.                             
Madison doesn't want to talk about it.   Sydney steps in.          
                      SYDNEY                                       
          Why don't you sit down, mom. You                         
          don't want to strain yourself.                           
                      MADISON                                      
          It's okay, mom.                                          
Jeanne sits. The effort took a lot out of her. Sydney gets         
her oxygen mask. Though Madison and her mother have a              
fractured relationship, there is clearly still love between        
mother and daughter.                                               
                       JEANNE                                      
          How you holding up, baby? Are you                        
          eating?                                                  
              (to Sydney)                                          
          Did you bring her the food I made?                       
                      MADISON                                      
          I'm fine, mom.                                           
Jeanne looks to her daughter.                                      
                      JEANNE                                       
          You were never a good lair, Maddy.                       
          What's going on?                                         
Madison looks to Sydney.                                           
                                                          53.

                      SYDNEY                                     
          Tell her, Maddy. Tell her                              
          everything.                                            
Jeanne looks between her daughters.                              
                      JEANNE                                     
          Are you in some kind of trouble,                       
          Maddy? How bad is it?                                  
                      MADISON                                    
          People have been dying, mom.                           
          Murdered. First Derek. Now there's                     
          two doctors who're dead.                               
                      JEANNE                                     
          That lady on the news?   What's that                   
          got to do with you?                                    
                      MADISON                                    
          Someone is killing people.   Someone                   
          from my past.                                          
Madison clams up.   Sydney takes her hand, comforting.

          You can do this.

          I've been -- seeing things. Seeing                     
          the people he kills when he kills                      
          them. I know it sounds crazy but                       
          it's true. And...                                      
                       JEANNE                                    
          And?                                                   
                                                                 
          She called me. At the police                           
          station. I knew her name.                              
          Gabrielle.                                             
Jeanne reacts to the name, like she was kicked in the gut.       
She looks sick.                                                  
Madison and Sydney see that their mom knows something.           
                       SYDNEY

Jeanne doesn't say anything. She heaves herself out of the       
wheelchair, moving to a the spare bedroom. Madison and           
Sydney trade a look. After a beat they follow their mother.      
INT. SPARE BEDROOM - DAY                                         
Filled with BOXES, and furniture, old family keepsakes.          
There's an 1990s-era tube TV on the dresser. It's like           
stepping back into the past.                                     
                                                        54.

Jeanne rifles through an old box, pulling out a stack of VHS     
tapes.

          Wow. Mom. Hoard, much? Why did                         
          you keep all of this junk?                             
                      JEANNE                                     
          It's not junk. It's our family                         
          memories, why wouldn't I keep it?

          Because times have changed. You                        
          know there's digital now?                              
          Streaming. I feel like we're gonna                     
          find a dead cat under there.                           
                        JEANNE                                   
          Oh stop it.                                            
Jeanne searches the labels until she finds what she's looking    
for. She pulls it out of the stack. It's labeled "Madison's      
8th Birthday." Jeanne puts the tape into an old VCR player       
that is connected to the TV. The TV crackles to life.            
Jeanne plays the tape.

Madison sits at a decorated table, birthday cap on. It's         
just her, a few stuffed animals. There are no children at        
this party. Young Madison has no friends. Sydney glances to      
her sister, sad.

          your candles?

Jeanne, thirty years younger, seven months pregnant, emerges        
from the kitchen with a homemade cake. There's a giant 8            
candle in the center. Jeanne sets down the cake. Both

Madison blows out the candle. Madison cocks her head, like          
she's listening to someone whispering in her ear. Madison           
glances to the camera, a guilty look on her face. She shakes        
her head "no" to whomever she was listening to.

          At first we thought it was a phase.                     
          But you were always talking to her.                     
          Some of the conversations you had --                    
          it chilled me to the bone. It was                       
          like she was real. But she wasn't,                      
          Maddy. Gabrielle was your imaginary

          took it out, when you were better,                      
          my husband and I adopted you. It                        
          was all so much for someone so

                      SYDNEY                                      
          Why would she lie?                                      
                      MADISON                                     
          Why wouldn't she tell me this?                          
          Before?                                                 
                      SYDNEY                                      
          Because she wanted to protect you.                      
                      MADISON                                     
          You always take her side.                               
                      SYDNEY                                      
          There aren't sides, Maddy. We only                      
          want to help you. Maybe she should                      
          have told you this before. But mom's                    
          trying to do her best now. That has                     
          to count for something.                                 
                      MADISON                                     
          Do you think I'm crazy?                                 
                      SYDNEY                                      
          No.                                                     
Madison nods. Grateful for that. She unlocks her seatbelt.        
Sydney does the same.                                             
                      MADISON                                     
          No.                                                     
              (off her look)                                      
          I'm fine. I don't need a babysitter.                    
                                                         58.

                      SYDNEY                                     
          Are you sure you should be alone?                      
          With everything that's going on?                       
                      MADISON                                    
          I want to be alone. Because of                         
          everything that's going on. Please,                    
          Syd. Go home.                                          
Sydney watches as Madison gets out of the car.   Once Madison    
is safely inside, Sydney leaves.                                 
INT. LOFT SPACE - NIGHT                                          
CLOSE ON: a BLADE. The edge runs across a sharpening stone       
in quick, succinct movements.                                    
Skkkkkkkrttttt... skkkkkkkrttttt...   It's getting sharper       
with every pass.                                                 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL                                              
Gabrielle, wearing black leather gloves and a hoodie, hunched    
over a table, surrounded by shadow. The sound of the blade       
echoes through the loft.                                         
Skkkkkkkrttttt... skkkkkkkrttttt...                              
Across the loft, bound to the bed, Jane Doe watches.             
Gabrielle's attention is on her task so Jane Doe works her       
wrist in circles, trying to get the knot loose. She's            
focused on her binds, doesn't hear the sudden silence.           
                      GABRIELLE (O.S.)                           
          IT WON'T WORK.                                         
Jane Doe snaps around. Though she's covered in shadow,           
Gabrielle is watching her.                                       
                      GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                         
          YOU'RE WORKING THE KNOT TO GET IT                      
          LOOSE. SMART.                                          
Gabrielle walks toward her. Jane Doe pinches her eyes            
closed, terrified. Gabrielle reaches out -- gripping the         
rope. She TIGHTENS it. The rope digs into Jane Doe's skin.       
                      GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                         
          NOW TRY.                                               
Jane Doe is too afraid to move.   Gabrielle grips her face,      
pressing it into the bed.                                        
                      GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                         
          DO IT.                                                 
Whimpering, Jane Doe tries to roll her wrist around.   She       
can't.                                                           
                                                        59.

                       GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                        
          I CAN'T HAVE YOU LEAVING BEFORE                        
          YOU'VE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE.                            
              (pats her on the                                   
               head)                                             
          BE GOOD. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.                           
INT. DR WEAVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   
Erik's police cruiser is parked along the curb. He walks to      
the front door, RIPPING off the police tape. Pulling on          
plastic gloves, he enters.                                       
INT. DR. WEAVER'S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT                         
Erik enters. He shines his light over the room, searching.       
He can't shake the feeling he missed something the first time    
around. He opens the drawers in the desk, checking for false     
bottoms. He feels underneath for anything taped to the top.      
He turns around, shining his light over the bookcase. The        
shelves lined with medical books. Everything is neat,            
even...                                                          
Except for one shelf.                                            
One shelf is a bit off-kilter.   It has fewer books than the     
others. Curious, Erik checks.    He pulls the books. Nothing     
on top. He runs his hand under   the shelf. Toward the back      
his hand touches something. He   pulls.                          
CLICK.                                                           
The back wall of the bookcase gives way, revealing a shallow     
secret compartment. There are FILES inside. Erik reaches         
in, pulling out a thick manilla folder secured with rubber       
bands. He snaps them off, thumbing through the paperwork.        
A THUMBDRIVE falls out, hitting the floor. Erik picks it up,     
sees it's labeled EMILY MAY. Erik looks around. Dr. Weaver's     
laptop is still on her desk. He opens it, the laptop             
lighting up, coming out of sleep mode. Erik plugs the thumb      
drive in. He clicks on the icon, opening the contents.           
There's one file: PROJECT TERATOMA                               
Erik clicks it. The file opens, revealing it's full of VIDEO     
CLIPS. Erik clicks one.                                          
ON SCREEN an office, circa 1990s. Plain. Just a desk and a       
wall. DR. WEAVER, thirty years younger, steps into frame.        
She looks exhausted. She leans against her desk, talking to      
the camera.                                                      
                      DR. WEAVER                                 
          It's Tuesday, June 23rd. Four-                         
          fourteen pm. I am Dr. Florence                         
          Weaver. We are on day three of                         
          treatment of Emily May, six years of                   
          age, and this patient is...                            
                      (MORE)
                                                        60.
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)
            unlike anything I've ever seen.                      
            I've found no other cases that I can                 
            reference for our treatment. It may                  
            in fact be the first recorded case                   
            ever. Which means we're about to                     
            make history.                                        
Dr. Weaver pulls out Emily's medical file, reading.              
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)                      
            Patient, although young, suffers                     
            from extreme mental psychosis,                       
            hearing a voice, having disturbing                   
            visions of someone she calls "the                    
            Devil". Patient thus far has                         
            resisted normal courses of                           
            treatment, as such she is getting                    
            sicker, having lost ten pounds in                    
            the last two days. Current course                    
            of action is surgery, otherwise                      
            patient may die. I've contacted Dr.                  
            John Gregory out of Hopkins, as well                 
            as Dr. Victor Field from Los Angeles                 
            Children's Hospital.                                 
WITH ERIK                                                        
He reacts, recognizing Victor's name. He quickly flips           
through the file, coming across an old, black and white photo    
of a much younger Victor Field. Holy shit, the two victims       
are connected to each other. Erik reads his file.                
                        ERIK                                     
                (sotto)                                          
            That's how you knew them.   You were                 
            a surgeon.                                           
Erik finds a photo of Dr. John Gregory, a handsome young         
doctor at the time. Suddenly something clicks in his head:       
two out of three of those doctors are now dead. That leaves      
John Gregory.                                                    
                        ERIK (CONT'D)                            
            Shit.                                                
He's on his cell, calling.                                       
                         ERIK (CONT'D)                           
                (into phone)                                     
            This is Detective Shaw. I need an                    
            address for a Dr. John Gregory and I                 
            need it yesterday.                                   
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT                     
Madison stands at the mirror, brushing her teeth at the sink.  
She leans over the sink. Spits, rinses. When she comes up --  
THE REFELCTION IN THE MIRROR HAS CHANGED.                        
                                                         61.

She's standing in her bathroom, yet the mirror reflects a        
different bathroom entirely. It's a swanky, expensive post-      
modern bathroom. In the bathtub is JOHN GREGORY. He's            
relaxing, reading a book on his tablet. Madison immediately      
realizes what's going on.                                        
                      MADISON                                    
          No. No... no... nonononono...                          
CLOSE ON MADISON.   She pinches her eyes shut, trying to will    
it away.                                                         
                         MADISON (CONT'D)                        
          I'm at home.     I'm at home. I'm at                   
          home.                                                  
O.S. John CRIES OUT, shocked.                                    
                      JOHN                                       
          What are you doing in here?    Who are                 
          you?                                                   
Madison opens her eyes. She's now IN JOHN'S BATHROOM,            
transported yet again. John is looking at her, terrified.        
Then -- Gabrielle, face obscured by her long hair, wearing       
her leather gloves, her hoodie, steps into frame. Madison        
gasps, covering her mouth to keep from screaming. Gabrielle      
turns to Madison, her twisted lips pulling into a smile. She     
holds up her freshly sharp amputation knife.                     
She steps toward John, who SCREAMS...                            
EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT                                   
Erik's car skids to a stop in front of the apartment             
building. He gets out, flashing his badge to the DOORMAN,        
who lets him in.                                                 
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
Erik gets off the elevator. Going up to the only apartment       
door on this floor. Erik knocks, and the door OPENS.
Erik peeks through the crack, and then steps into the lavish
apartment.
                      ERIK
          John Gregory? This is Detective
          Erik Shaw.
There's a CREAK from the bathroom.   On instinct Erik reaches
for his weapon.
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          If you're in here I need you to
          answer me.
                                                             62.

O.S. there's a MUFFLED CRY and a HARD THUMP.      Erik pulls his
weapon, cocks it. He enters, gun ready.
                         ERIK (CONT'D)
             Mr. Gregory, call out to me if you
             can.                                                   
No answer.    Erik makes his way to the bathroom, turning the
corner --
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
WITH MADISON                                                        
                                                                    
She sees Erik enter.    He doesn't see her, because she's not
really there.                                                       
Madison watches as Erik finds John Gregory slumped in the           
bathtub in a pool of his own blood, his face sliced to
ribbons, his eyes carved out. His body TWITCHES, still
alive.
                         ERIK
             Jesus --
                         MADISON                                    
             She's still here. Detective!   She's                   
             still here!                                            
Her warning is in vain. He can't hear her.        Erik grabs his    
cell phone, calling 9-1-1.                                          
Madison POINTS to the ceiling. Through her vision she sees          
what Erik cannot -- right above him, clung into the corner of       
the walls and ceiling like a spider, is Gabrielle.                  
As Erik steps through the door...                                   
                         MADISON (CONT'D)                           
             DON'T!                                                 
He turns to the mirror just in time see Gabrielle's                 
reflection as she drops down with her KNIFE out before her.         
Erik spins around in time to dodge the blade, but is KNOCKED
BACKWARDS onto the floor.
Gabrielle jumps Erik. They struggle as Gabrielle tries to           
gut him. Dressed in all black, her deformed face partially          
obscured by her hair and her hoodie. Erik is shocked by what        
he's seeing. Gabrielle grips the amputation knife in her            
hand. Erik whips his gun up, FIRING.
Gabrielle lunges at Erik, slamming him out the bathroom door        
into the hallway. They collapse onto the ground. The gun
slides out of Erik's hand. Gabrielle plunges her KNIFE DOWN         
at Erik's face, but Erik catches it just in time, pushing it
aside as the blade stabs into the floor. Erik reaches his           
gun, whips it at Gabrielle --                                       
                                                        63.

With cat-like reflexes Gabrielle DODGES the shot, RUNNING out    
of the apartment.                                                
Madison watches, helpless, as Erik gives chase.                  
INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Erik runs into the hallway just in time to see the back of
Gabrielle's head disappearing around the corner. Erik            
follows, taking the corner. Erik has become a running            
juggernaut, but he's still not gaining on Gabrielle.             
Gabrielle bursts through a window onto a fire escape.            
Showering glass everywhere. She skitters up the stairs, like     
an insect. Erik tries to keep up.
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                             
CAMERA IS BEHIND Erik as he bounds after Gabrielle, giving it    
everything he's got. Even still, she's pulling away. She         
reaches the edge of the roof, LEAPS, disappearing on the         
other side.                                                      
Erik doesn't bother to look before. Fueled by adrenaline he      
LEAPS -- saaaaaiiiiling through the air                          
WHAM!                                                            
He hits the another apartment rooftop, barely missing the        
ventilator. He quickly gets back on his feet, scrambling up.     
Gabrielle is booking it across the edge of the roof. Erik        
pulls his gun.                                                   
                       ERIK                                      
          STOP!                                                  
Gabrielle keeps going, hunched over, crab-walking on the         
ledge. Erik FIRES. Gabrielle dodges with almost inhuman          
speed. She's upright, BOLTING for the stairwell door.            
Erik FIRES two more rounds, blasting the door before             
Gabrielle reaches the door. She turns on a dime, retreating      
to the fire escape. Erik is up, tearing ass after her.           
He reaches the fire escape just as Gabrielle dives over head     
first. Erik leans over, awe struck by what he sees.              
HIS POV: Gabrielle spider-crawling down the fire escape, head    
first.                                                           
Erik aims, looking for a clear shot. But Gabrielle is            
weaving in and out of the fire escape. He has as shot --         
FIRES -- it ricochets off the metal.                             
Gabrielle reaches the ground, BACK FLIPPING to her feet. She     
RUNS, but Erik clocks there's something weird, disjointed        
about her movements.                                             
                                                          64.

                      ERIK (CONT'D)                              
          What the fuck.                                         
He aims again, fires -- HE'S OUT. Fuck.   Gabrielle              
disappears into the dark alleyway.                               
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 
Forensics going over the corpse of John Gregory. Camera
flashing away. Erik's being tended to by a medic.

          He -- ran and crawled?
                      ERIK
          She. I know what I saw. But I've                       
          never seen anything quite like it.
                      REGINA                                     
          What were you doing here anyway?
          How did you know this guy was next?
                      ERIK
          I dug deeper, and found that this
          guy, Doctor John Gregory, used to
          work with Doctor Field and Doctor
          Weaver, thirty years ago at a
          private medical facility. Guess who
          their mutual patient was?
Regina knows who his partner is referring to.                    
                      REGINA                                     
          All roads lead to our person-of-

          I've seen Madison move. It's                           
          nothing like what I saw.                               
A TECH FORENSIC approaches them.
                      TECH FORENSIC
          Guys, check this out.
She waves them over to the front door.   They follow.   She
shows them the door lock mechanism.
                      TECH FORENSIC (CONT'D)
          High voltage magnetic locking
          system. Not your run-of-the-mill
          dead-bolt.
She drops to her knees, puts her nose up to it, sniffing it.
Up close, it looks charred.
                      TECH FORENSIC (CONT'D)
          Smell it.
                                                          65.

Regina does.   Screws up her face.                                
                      REGINA                                      
          Smells like someone burned a hobo's

                      TECH FORENSIC
          This is how our perp got in. Fried
          it with a hundred thousand volts.
          Maybe with a shock baton. But I
          don't see any marking on the
          exterior. It's like it exploded
          internally.
Erik thinks.   Then pushes the door open, and steps out into
the hallway.
INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
He looks up at the ceiling, and see what he's looking for
down the hall. The security camera.

Regina runs out of the Penthouse.                                 
INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - SECURITY ROOM - LATER
ON SECURITY   MONITOR: footage of the empty hallway. Then A
FIGURE IN A   BLACK TRENCH COAT AND HOODIE strides into frame,    
              the hall: Gabrielle. She walks with a weird         
pacing down
gait, up to   the penthouse door.
                        ERIK (O.S.)
          That's her.                                             
                      REGINA                                      
          You really believe it's a woman?                        
                      ERIK                                        
          The footprints we found at Dr.                          
          Weaver's were average for a woman.                      
          That was a detail you pointed out.                      
Erik's hunched over, studying intensely. Regina stands            
behind the SECURITY GUARD who's running the playback machine.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: Gabrielle stands before the door. The        
lights in the hallway begins to flicker. She holds out a          
hand to the door lock and the light zapping intensifies.
Then momentarily blackout. The lights kick back on. No more
flickering, but also no more figure standing in the hallway.
Gabrielle's gone. The door to the penthouse swings open.          
Erik and Regina exchange looks.                                   
                                                           66.

          W.   T.   F.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: Now we see Erik's arrival.   Approaching
the door cautiously, and then entering.
                      ERIK
          Fast forward.
The Security Guard does.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: The image races forward, digitally
tearing. Empty, static shot of the hallway -- then, THE
FIGURE SCRAMBLES OUT --
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          Stop -- back up.
The Guard does as told.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: Gabrielle runs out into the hallway, and     
scampers away. Erik follows behind, pursuing.                     
                      ERIK (CONT'D)
          Play that again.
The Guard hits the buttons.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: Gabrielle dashes out into the hallway,       
and scampers off. Except this time, at closer inspection, we
notice her movements look weird. Her steps are big and wild.      
Her limbs bend at odd angles.                                     
                      REGINA                                      
          The bitch does run weird.                               
                      ERIK
          Rewind -- I mean play it back while
          rewinding.
The Guard reverses the video while playing in real time.
ON SECURITY MONITOR: Gabrielle's run seems to make better         
sense in reverse. Which makes no sense.
                       REGINA                                     
          Huh.   Her running looks less weird.                    
Erik straightens up and rubs his face, trying to understand
this.   His cell rings. He sees the caller ID, answers.

Erik and Regina sit with Madison at her house.                   
                      ERIK
          All three of them were involved in a
          case study called Project Teratoma.
          You were the case study. And they
          were your doctors.
Madison shakes her head.
                      MADISON
          I don't remember them or my life
          before I was adopted by Sydney's
          parents.
Erik and Regina share a surprised look.   This is news.          
Regina writes this in a notepad.                                 
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          Apparently I was sick a lot. That's
          all I know.
                      ERIK
          I believe your name was Emily May                      
          before your parents renamed you.
Madison takes this revelation in.
                      MADISON
          That's what she calls me.                              
                      ERIK
          Madison. The key to catching this
          killer is unlocking your past.

          Would you be open to hypnotherapy?
          The Department works with a
          psychiatrist that helps with --
          trauma, sexually abused, PTSD --
          victims. People that have resorted
          to repressing their memories to
          survive.
Madison thinks about this for a beat. She has never
considered this before. Partly because she's afraid of what
it might unlock. Finally, reluctantly, she nods.
                      MADISON
          Why not.

          killed my husband. My...                              
Madison's voice trails off. There's a KNOCK at the front        
door. Sydney answers, revealing Erik, Regina and the            
psychiatrist, BEVERLY WOODS, 40s.                               
                      ERIK                                      
          May we come in?                                       
Sydney can't hide the scowl on her face. Nevertheless, she      
steps aside. Madison stands, greeting Beverly. Beverly is       
sweet, calming.                                                 
                      BEVERLY                                   
          I'm Beverly Woods, I'll be                            
          conducting the examination today.                     
          How are you, Madison?                                 
                      MADISON                                   
          Good. Nice to meet you.     This is my                
          sister, Sydney.                                       
                      BEVERLY                                   
          I understand everyone is anxious.                     
                      SYDNEY                                    
          Is that your professional opinion?                    
                      MADISON                                   
          Sydney, please.                                       
                      BEVERLY                                   
          Why don't we get started.                             
Madison takes a seat. Beverly sits across from her. Erik and    
Regina stand by Sydney. Sydney is tense, but she's really       
worried for her sister.                                         
                       ERIK                                     
              (leans in)                                        
          It would benefit you to play well                     
          with others. This is to help your                     
          sister.                                               
                                                        69.

                      SYDNEY                                   
          You think she's crazy.                               
                      ERIK                                     
          We just want to get to the truth.                    
Sydney looks to her sister. Madison seems worried, scared.     
Sydney smiles, providing courage. You can do this.             
                      BEVERLY                                  
          Don't be scared. Remember, whatever
          happens, no matter how troubled
          things may seem, you're safe, back
          here. With us.
              (beat)
          Now close your eyes.
Madison, hesitates, but closes her eyes.
                      BEVERLY (CONT'D)                         
          Lets turn back the hands of time.
          Imagine a clock. Rewinding. Going
          backwards. Slow at first. But
          gradually spinning. Faster, and
          faster. The by-gone-years
          reconstructing themselves. Like a
          dead rose -- un-wiltering. The
          faded red returning. Springing back
          to life. Time slows down. You've
          gone back as far as you can. Tell                    
          me, Madison. What age are you now?
Madison is slow to speak, and her speech is detached.
                       MADISON
          Eight.
                      BEVERLY                                  
          Can you go further back?
                       MADISON
          No.   I see only blackness.
                     BEVERLY                                   
          OK. You're eight years old.      Where
          are you?
                      MADISON
          At my new home.
                      BEVERLY                                  
          Do you like your new home.
                      MADISON
          It's different.
                      BEVERLY                                  
          Who are you with?
                                                           70.

                      MADISON
          I have a new mom and dad.    They seem
          nice.
                      BEVERLY                                       
          Is anyone else around?
                       MADISON
          No.
              (nervous)
          I mean, yes. Him.
                       BEVERLY                                      
          Who?
Madison hesitates.   Seems scared.   Whispers:
                       MADISON
          Gabrielle.                                                
Erik remembers this name from Emily's files.     He leans in.       
                      BEVERLY                                       
          Who is Gabrielle?                                         
                      MADISON
          She says she's my friend.    She plays                    
          with me.
                       BEVERLY                                      
          Oh yeah.   What do you play?                              
                      MADISON
          Games. Hide and seek. Drawings.
          She likes playing with the lights.                        
Madison's face twitches.

INT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST NOOK - FLASHBACK
CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of A YOUNG MADISON, 7, seated at
a table drawing with crayons when the lights around her
begins flickering.
She snaps around, looking past us at someone.
                      YOUNG MADISON
          Gabrielle -- stop it. You're gonna                        
          get me in trouble.

                      PSYCHIATRIST
          Does she play with anyone else?                           
                                                       71.

A beat of silence.
                        MADISON
          No.    Only I can see her.                            
Erik and Regina steal a glance to one another. Sydney           
catches this. Her eyes fall back to her sister, growing more    
concerned.

INT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST NOOK - FLASHBACK
Same scene as before, but now we're REVERSE on YOUNG MADISON
at the table, looking behind her. There's no one there. The
lights stop flickering.

                      BEVERLY                                   
          Is Gabrielle your imaginary friend?                   
                         MADISON
          Dunno.     She seems real to me.                      
                      BEVERLY                                   
          Do you like her?                                      
                       MADISON
          Sometimes.
              (whispering)
          Sometimes she scares me.                              
Madison starts breathing heavily.
                       BEVERLY                                  
          Why?   What does he do?
                      MADISON
          He says things. Bad things. Put
          thoughts in my head. They give me
          horrible dreams.
                                                   FLASH TO:
INT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - MADISON'S ROOM - FLASHBACK
YOUNG MADISON sleeps restlessly in bed. CAMERA PUSHES IN on
her distressed face. We hear WHISPERS surrounding her, as
though they're seeping out of her dreams.
                      BEVERLY (V.O.)                            
          What kind of dreams?
The table lamp starts to dim, darkness descending upon
Madison. She gets more and more agitated as the CAMERA GETS
CLOSER, and the whispering builds to a crescendo --
                                                          72.

                      MADISON (V.O.)
          Mom calls them night terrors.
YOUNG MADISON JOLTS AWAKE, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER.
                      YOUNG MADISON
          STOP IT -- STOP IT, GABRIELLE!!                          
          LEAVE ME ALONE!
Mom and Dad come running in, consoling her.    She's crying
hysterically.
                                                       BACK TO:
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - PRESENT
Madison flails in her seat, reliving the nightmares she has
spent years repressing. Sydney steps forward, putting a hand       
on Madison's shoulder steadying her, concerned.                    
                        SYDNEY                                     
          That's it.    Enough.                                    
                      REGINA                                       
          We're not done here.                                     
  Erik steps up.                                                   
                      ERIK
          You know what -- lets stop -- get
          her out of it.
Beverly nods, leans into Madison.                                  
                      BEVERLY                                      
          When I tap your forehead you'll be
          back with us.
She taps Madison on the forehead. Madison slowly calms down.       
Steadying. Her breathing slowly back to normal. Eventually
she opens her eyes, meeting Sydney's relieved expression.          
                        ERIK
          Are you OK?
Madison nods, nervously.
                      MADISON
          Yeah, I'm OK.
She collects herself.
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          I remember... waking up crying.
          Every night. Terrified of the
          whispering in my head...
                      ERIK
          When did all of this stop?                               
                                                         73.

Madison continues processing. Shards of memories returning.
Like a puzzle she's trying to piece together. She looks to       
Sydney, smiles.                                                  
                       MADISON
          When my baby sister came along.
              (to Sydney)                                        
          My closeness with you pushed                           
          Gabrielle further and further away.                    
          Till eventually, she was nothing but                   
          a distant memory buried deep in the
          back of my head. I never heard from
          Gabrielle again.                                       
              (beat)
          Until now.
Erik listens intently.   Where is this going?
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
                                                                 
          The killer says she's Gabrielle.      My
          Gabrielle.                                             
Erik and Regina look at one another, perplexed by this           
revelation.
                      REGINA                                     
          Wait -- Are you saying the killer is                   
          -- your imaginary friend?? She has                     
          come to life and is killing people?
                      MADISON
          I know it sounds crazy.
Regina is having a hard time accepting this story.               
Unfortunately for Madison, so is Erik.                           
INT. LOFT SPACE - DAY
Alone, Jane Doe continues to test her binds. She wiggles her     
wrists around, pulling at them. The rope digs into her skin.     
She stops. Desperate, she looks around for anything she can      
use to free herself.                                             
The post on the bed is rusted. There's a jagged edge at the      
top. Jane Doe maneuvers her arm to the sharp metal. She          
runs the rope against it, back and forth as fast, hard as she    
can. As she works she keeps an eye on the shadow across the      
room, making sure Gabrielle hasn't come back.                    
SNAP.                                                            
Part of the rope tears. It's working. Jane Doe works             
faster, the rope digging into her skin. Her wrist starts         
BLEEDING. She fights through the pain, keeps going.              
The rest of the rope gives way. She tears her arm free.          
Using her teeth she pulls at the knot on her other arm,          
working it loose until she gets her arm free. She wastes no      
time untying her legs. She's free.                               
                                                           74.

She pulls her mouth-gag down, inhales a deep breath. She          
hops off the rusty metal bed, squeaking away. She scans           
around, trying to find a way out, she takes a step, the floor
creaks. She takes another step --                                 
THE FLOOR BREAKS UNDER HER WEIGHT and she FALLS THROUGH!          
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Just as Madison and Sydney are showing Erik, Regina and           
Beverly to the front door JANE DOE CRASHES THROUGH THE            
CEILING INTO THE LIVING ROOM. Her body smashes into the           
coffee table --
Everyone JUMPS OUT OF THEIR SKIN!
Wood splinters and debris explode everywhere.
Everyone gawks in horror and shock.   What the fuck?!!!           
OFF Madison's scream --
EXT. MITCHELL HOME - LATER
The front yard of Madison's house is buzzing with police
activity. Jane Doe, now unconscious, is wheeled into an           
ambulance.
Madison sits in the back of a police cruiser, sobbing
hysterically. Her hands are cuffed behind her. Sydney             
pleads with Erik and Regina.                                      
                      SYDNEY                                      
          Look, please, I don't know what's                       
          going on but I know my sister. She                      
          isn't capable of doing this.                            
                      REGINA                                      
          Maybe her "imaginary friend" is.                        
          Whoever did it, you should be                           
          talking to a lawyer.                                    
Sydney looks to Erik.   He nods.   This does not look good for    
Madison.                                                          
                       UNIFORMED OFFICER                          
          Detectives.                                             
              (off their looks)                                   
          You need to see this.                                   
INT. MITCHELL HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER                       
Forensics swarm Madison's house. Dusting for prints,              
infrared sensors, bagging hair fragments into plastic bags,       
etc.                                                              
Erik, Regina and Sydney follow the uniformed officer. He          
leads them to Madison's closet. Along the back wall is a          
FALSE DOOR. There are stairs that lead to the loft.               
                                                            75.

INT. MITCHELL HOME - LOFT - CONTINUOUS                             
The officer leads them into the loft space. The room is lit        
by flood lights. Techs snap photos, bag evidence. Everyone         
takes in the space. Sydney is stunned.                             
Erik moves to the desk in the shadow of the room. The stolen       
files from Dr. Weavers office as strewn across the top.            
There's a MAP taped to the wall, with push pins in each of         
the victims locations.                                             
                        REGINA                                     
          Holy shit.    It's a fucking lair.                       
Erik looks to Sydney.   She's on the verge of tears, can't         
believe it.                                                        
                      ERIK                                         
          You really need to call a lawyer.                        
Regina scoffs. Finally. He's come around. Regina moves             
deeper into the room, rounding a corner -- COMING FACE TO          
FACE WITH GABRIELLE!                                               
                        REGINA                                     
          JESUS!                                                   
Regina staggers back, her foot BREAKING through another part       
of the floor. Erik catches her, steadying his partner.             
                        REGINA (CONT'D)                            
          Fuck!                                                    
Sydney comes around. It's not Gabrielle.   It's just a black       
trench coat hanging from the rafters.                              
                      ERIK                                         
          That's what she was wearing at the                       
          last crime scene.                                        
Erik spots something BEHIND the coat. Using the back of his        
hand he pushes the trench coat aside, revealing -- THE             
AMPUTATION KNIFE. Still covered in John Gregory's blood.           
Sydney heaves, sick at the sight.   Regina looks to them,          
vindicated.                                                        
                      REGINA                                       
          We got another victim. We got                            
          motive. We got the murder weapon.                        
          Beyond any doubt we got our killer.                      
          And she is very real.                                    
INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                           
Madison sits at an interrogation table.    Her face is pale and
drained of life.
                                                           76.

Erik and Regina enter the interrogation room, carrying            
evidence bags containing the BLACK TRENCH COAT and the KNIFE.     
They lay them out on the table for Madison to see.   Madison
eyes go wide upon seeing the bloodied weapon.
                      REGINA                                      
          You have the murder weapon in your
          house, and Jeffrey Dahmer's workshop
          in your attic. It's over, Madison.
Madison's floored.    Trying to process the implication.
                      MADISON
          It's Gabrielle. She has access to                       
          my house. She got in before.                            
                      REGINA                                      
          Your imaginary friend, huh?
Madison gets upset.    The lights SURGE.
                      ERIK
          Who is the woman, Madison?
                      MADISON
          I don't know! Gabrielle must've                         
          snuck her into my house while I was--                   
                         REGINA                                   
          -- ENOUGH.     ENOUGH WITH THE BOGEYMAN
          STORY.
Madison's sobbing now.    Turns to Erik.
                      MADISON
          Erik, you've encountered her -- DO I                    
          LOOK LIKE HER??                                         
Erik doesn't know what to think, or say.
INT. PRECINCT - ROOM NEXT DOOR - SAME TIME
Through the one-way mirror, Lieutenant Daniels watches,           
standing next to Sydney.                                          
                      SYDNEY                                      
          You shouldn't be questioning her                        
          without her lawyer.                                     
                      LIEUTENANT DANIELS                          
          She's cooperating willingly. She                        
          can stop any time.                                      
Sydney watches her sister through the glass, her heart            
breaking.                                                         
                                                            77.

                      REGINA                                       
          Let me tell you what I think. You
          were sick in the head when you were
          young. Those doctors operated on
          you. It worked for awhile. But now
          your sickness has returned, and
          you've gone on a revenge spree,
          killing everyone involved.
INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME
The more upset Madison gets the brighter the LIGHTS become.
                      MADISON
          GODAMMIT -- IT'S NOT ME.
                      REGINA                                       
          STOP LYING AND TELL US THE TRUTH.
The LIGHTS surge until the room is almost blinding.    Everyone
winces, covering their eyes.
                       MADISON
              (Screaming)
          I AM TELLING THE TRUUUUTH!
POP! THE FLUORESCENT TUBES EXPLODE! All around them.
Sparks shower down. Accent lights are still on. Dimly lit.
                      REGINA                                       
          What the fuck?!
Madison rocks back and forth, whispering to herself.
                      MADISON
          He's here... He's here...
                         ERIK
          Madison --
Shaw's phone VIBRATES.    A call is coming through.
Madison stops rocking, finally looks at them. There's
something different about her now. She's calmer. Certain.
                         MADISON
          That's her.                                              
Erik takes the phone out of his pocket.   CALLER UNKNOWN.    He
hesitates.
                      MADISON (CONT'D)
          She wants to talk to you.                                
                      REGINA                                       
          You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Erik answers, placing it on the table and putting it on
speaker.
                                                        78.

                      ERIK
          This is Detective Shaw.
From the other end of the phone comes a HIGH-PITCHED STATIC
FEEDBACK mixed with AN INHUMAN SCREECH. Everyone reacts.
A long beat.   Everyone waits.   Expecting.   Then --
                      GABRIELLE     (OVER PHONE)                
          HELLO, DETECTIVE.
The detectives bristle. Madison stares at the cellphone on
the table, once again frozen in place in wide-eyed fear.
Regina quickly pulls out her own cell phone, using the VOICE    
MEMO APP to record the conversation.
                      ERIK
          Who am I talking to?
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                    
          YOU KNOW WHO I AM. YOU FOUND ME.
                      ERIK
          I didn't find you soon enough.
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                    
          WELL, SORRY FOR THE MESS I LEFT
          BEHIND. I HAD TO RUN.
              (beat)
          LISTEN. I'M CALLING BECAUSE YOU
          TOOK A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT BELONGED
          TO ME. I WOULD LIKE THEM BACK,
          PLEASE.
                      ERIK
          They're evidence.
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                    
          OKAY. BUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GIVING
          EMILY ALL THE CREDIT FOR MY DEEDS.
          THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR. FOR ME.
Sydney reacts to her sister being called "Emily."
                      ERIK
          Tell me. Why did we find your stuff
          in her attic? Were you trying to
          incriminate her?
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                    
          OH NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO
          EMILY. I JUST NEEDED A PLACE TO
          NEST. AND KEEP AN EYE ON HER. GOD
          BLESS HER HEART FOR BEING SO
          OBLIVIOUS.
                      ERIK
          Why are you killing these people?
                                                            79.

                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                       
          TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. NOW THAT
          I'VE ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR IT, I'M
          UNQUENCHABLE. I PROMISE YOU,
          DETECTIVE, I WILL FEAST AGAIN.
A small crowd gathers on the other side of the mirror,
listening intently. Sydney looks terrified.
                      ERIK
          Is all this a personal vendetta?
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                       
          IT'S ALWAYS PERSONAL. EXCEPT IF MY
          BLADE HAD PUNCTURED YOUR FACE LAST
          NIGHT. THAT -- WOULD'VE BEEN
          NOTHING PERSONAL.
Erik tenses.   This guy knows about the scuffle.
                      ERIK
          What did they do to you?
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                       
          THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN EMILY AWAY
          FROM ME. SHE'S MY LIFE.
                      ERIK
          Who are you, Gabrielle?                                  
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE)                       
          OH, I THOUGHT SHE HAD ALREADY TOLD
          YOU. I'M A FIGMENT OF HER
          IMAGINATION --
GABRIELLE BURSTS INTO A DEVILISH CACKLE.    The cops look at       
one another, creeped out.
                      GABRIELLE (OVER PHONE) (CONT'D)              
          ASK EMILY WHAT SHE USED TO CALL ME.
Erik and Regina look to Madison. Without looking up, still         
in her frozen state, Madison fearfully whispers:
                         MADISON
          The Devil...
And with that -- click -- the call ends.    Silence.
Madison slowly comes out of her trance.    Her nose is
bleeding. She wipes it.
Everyone's looking around.    Quietly.   Nervously.   Then all
eyes land on Madison.
                                                        80.

INT. PRECINCT - ROOM NEXT DOOR - LATER
Through the one-way mirror, we see Madison seated alone in
the interrogation room, while Erik and Regina confer with       
Lieutenant Daniels. They all seem a bit shell-shocked.
                      LIEUTENANT DANIELS
          Do you think it's her? The...                         
          whatever the fuck she is.                             
                      ERIK
          She knew about our scuffle. She                       
          nearly put her knife into my skull.                   
                      REGINA                                    
          C'mon, she calls right in the middle                  
          of our interrogation to absolve her?
          That's too fucking convenient.
                      LIEUTENANT DANIELS
          Maybe they're working together?
                      ERIK
          I don't think so. This woman,                         
          whoever she is, is our killer.                        
          She's going to kill again. Madison                    
          is our key to capturing him.
The door opens, JASON CARTER, 40s, Madison's lawyer, enters.

          May I ask why you were interviewing                   
          my client without my explicit say-                    
          so?                                                   
                      REGINA                                    
          We read your client her rights.                       
          She's talking willingly.                              
                      LAWYER

          You're a too little too late,

                      LAWYER                                    
          And how, exactly did you obtain said                  
          evidence?

          We've had a new development. It may                    
          be your client, it may not. But if                     
          the killer is still out there Mrs.

          So you're offering protection now?                     
          A moment ago I was under the                           
          impression my client was the                           
          suspect. Which is it, detectives?

          We have your client for the next                       
          seventy-two hours. I'm sure we'll                      
          have it figured out by then.                           
EXT. PRECINCT - DAY                                              
Sydney storms out of the police precinct, gathering her
emotion. Trying not to cry. She runs her hands through her
hair, exasperated. She's gotta do something, anything to         
help her sister. An idea hits her. She dashes to her car.        
Pulls away.
EXT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - DAY
Sydney's car skids up to the front of her mom's house.   She
jumps out, and hurries into the house.
We hear sounds of OFF SCREEN rummaging.
                      JEANNE (PRELAP)
          Sydney, what are you looking for?
INT. JEANNE'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY
Sydney is riffling through the old boxes.                        
                      SYDNEY
          The medical clinic where Madison was
          institutionalized. You must have
          some paperwork from them.
                      JEANNE
          No, I told you we never dealt with
          them. It was all done through the
          adoption agency.
Jeanne pulls down a box, rummages through it and pulls out an
old document. Hands it to Sydney.
                      JEANNE (CONT'D)
          Here. The adoption paper. They
          would know.
                                                         82.

Sydney reads the name "CRADLE OF LOVE ADOPTION," beams as she
stands.
                      JEANNE (CONT'D)
          Why are you after this, Syd?
                        SYDNEY
          Because   to catch this killer, we
          need to   know Madison's life before
          us. Go    back to where she got so
          royally   screwed up.
Sydney is already out the door.
INT. PRECINCT - FEMALE HOLDING CELL - NIGHT
Cell bars slam shut in front of Madison's face.   She protest
in distress.
                      MADISON
          Please -- listen to me --   I beg
          you, I didn't do it!
The POLICE OFFICER ignores her, walking away.
After her fruitless protest, she looks around, terrified.
She's amongst the GANG MEMBERS, PROSTITUTES and DEGENERATES,
she sticks out like a sore thumb.
INT. SYDNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
Sydney drives, speaking on her phone through her car's           
bluetooth.

          I'm sorry ma'am but we're not                          
          allowed to release those files.

                      RECEPTIONIST                               
          I understand that, but those records                   
          are sealed.                                            
                      SYDNEY                                     
          Is there anyone else I can talk to?                    
                      RECEPTIONIST                               
          I can put you in touch with the                        
          adoption center director, but he'll                    
          only tell you the same thing.                          
                       SYDNEY                                    
          Fine.   I'll talk to him then.

INT. CRADLE OF LOVE ADOPTION AGENCY - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY    
Sydney, unusually relaxed, at ease, is seated at a desk          
across from CHRISTOPHER STANLEY, 60s, the adoption center        
director.

          Ms. Lake, I'm sorry you came all                       
          this way but I cannot give you those                   
          files.                                                 
Sydney smiles, reassuring.    Friendly.

          You've already helped me by seeing                     
          me, I appreciate your time. It                         
          means a lot to me and my sister.

          And your sister was adopted from our                   
          agency?                                                
                      SYDNEY                                     
          She was and our parents are ever                       
          thankful you gave them the                             
          opportunity to build their family.

                      SYDNEY                                     
          My sister is sick, Mr. Stanley. We                     
          know my sister had major surgery                       
          before she came into your care, but                    
          we're not sure what. Now whatever                      
          afflicted her before has come back.                    
          She's in the hospital, unconscious.                    
          Her doctor has no idea what's wrong                    
          and with an incomplete medical                         
          history there's only so much they                      
          can do. If we just knew what saved                     
          her as a child we may be able to ave                   
          her again... I'm trying to save my                     
          sister's life.                                         
This hits him.

          I understand. Legally, I can't give                    
          you any records.

          I don't want to put you in a                           
          difficult position. Anything you                       
          could tell me. I just... need you

She gives him a long stare, hoping he'll catch her meaning.      
He does.

          Well, it looks like I need to run to                   
          the little boys room. Do you mind?

Chris gives her a nod. He gets up, walking out. Leaving his      
computer unattended. Sydney turns the screen around,

          I'm working with a developer who's                     
          interested in the building, do you                     
          know who owns it?                                      
                                                         85.

                      WOMAN'S VOICE                             
          Well, we do. But I have to tell you                   
          the building hasn't been used in                      
          almost twenty years.                                  
                       SYDNEY                                   
          So it's just been sitting empty all                   
          these years?                                          
                      WOMAN'S VOICE                             
          That's correct. But look, the land                    
          it's on has the potential--                           
Sydney hangs up. She's got what she needed.                     
EXT. COUNTRY COASTAL - DUSK                                     
Sun sets over the countryside, covered by giant pine trees.
Sydney's car snakes along the road, cresting a hill and
revealing a large building institute on a cliff, overlooking
the ocean.
EXT. SIMION HILL CLINIC - NIGHT
A run-down facility in a huge compound. Once great, now
abandoned and derelict. The only signs of life are stray
dogs and security guards that patrol it for the owners.
Sydney kills her headlights as her car pulls up, trying not
to be seen. She parks in the bushes, and gets out with a
flashlight.
Sydney walks to the chainlink fence enclosing the perimeter.
There's a large, faded, NO TRESPASSING SIGN lazily hanging
catty-corner. Even the sign doesn't give a fuck anymore.
Sydney tests the fence, looking for an opening. A few feet
away she finds a tear in the fence big enough for her to
squeeze through.
Sydney pulls herself through the fence. She looks around.
It's fallen into grave disrepair. In the darkness it's an
eerie, macabre environment. The last place you'd ever want
to be.
The beam of a flashlight comes around a corner. Sydney kills
her light and hides, as a SECURITY GUARD rounds the corner
and strolls by where Sydney is hiding. His radio crackling.
Once the guard is out of sight, she darts out and makes her
way to the clinic entrance. The PADLOCK on the door has long
been broken off. It's open.
Sydney pushes the door open with a loud, rusty CREAK.   She
steps inside.
                                                            86.

INT. SIMION HOSPITAL - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Sydney stands inside the doorway. The hospital is dark, only
a few shards of light creeping through. Anything could be
hiding in here. Sydney hesitates, reconsidering her
decision. She shakes off her fear, pushing forward.
Sydney illuminates the hallway, searching.
The walls are cracked, paint peeling off in large patches.
There are yellowed, brittle papers tacked to walls. The
floors are buckled and warped. There are HOLES where
scavengers have tried for the copper in the walls.
The darkness.   The stillness.   It's oppressive.   Daunting.
A SHADOW darts along the wall. Sydney STARTLES, shining her
light -- it's a rat. And then another rat. They dart along
the wall, their solitude interrupted by Sydney's presence.
Sydney pulls herself together, moving forward.      She finds an
old faded, DIRECTORY by the ADMISSIONS DESK.
Sydney finds what she's looking for -- RECORDS. Sydney's
face drops. It's in the basement. Motherfucker.
The creepiness is about to get a lot worse.
O.S. there's a LOW, THREATENING GROWL. Sydney turns to the          
noise -- down the hall are a pack of mangy, wild dogs pacing        
towards her. They look mean. And hungry. Sydney slowly              
back away. The dogs match her step for step. The alpha              
GROWLS, hair raised. Sydney breaks into a sprint. The dogs          
give chase.                                                         
Sydney runs for her life.                                           
INT. SIMION HILL CLINIC - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                     
Sydney rounds the corner. She tries every door but they're          
all locked. Then, one OPENS. It's the STAIRWELL.                    
INT. SIMION HILL CLINIC - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                    
Sydney flies down the flight of stairs. A few of the dogs           
make it through before it closes, following her, sniping and        
barking.                                                            
Sydney hits the bottom. There's an open door. She takes it,         
slamming it shut behind her. The dogs leap and pound on the         
door, barking, growling.                                            
INT. SIMION HOSPITAL - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT                         
Sydney takes a beat, catches her breath. On the other side          
of the door she can hear the dogs. She moves away from the          
door. Her flashlight cuts through the darkness, illuminating        
the space. It's like a cavern.
                                                           87.

There are ROWS of FILING CABINETS. Cobwebs dress the room,
along with a thick layer of dust and grime.
Sydney coughs. It's stuffy, tough to breath. She pushes
through, making her way through the maze of filing cabinets,
finding the section for PATIENT FILES. Sydney makes her way
to the "R" section.
Searching through all the labeled boxes until she finds --
MAY, EMILY, F. She opens it. There are extensive notes and        
MEDICAL PHOTOS of young Madison. Some are of Madison with
her head shaved, looking forlorn.
                         SYDNEY
                (reading)
            Patient's teratoma the result of an
            absorption in utero, growing in sync
            with patient -- syphoning nutrients.
Whatever the hell that means. She continues riffling through
the box, and finds a pile of VHS TAPES at the bottom. Sydney
grabs the whole box, hurrying out.
INT. JEANNE'S HOME - STOREROOM - NIGHT
Sydney enters, carrying the box of medical files and VHS
tapes she procured from the hospital. Jeanne follows.
                        JEANNE
            What on earth -- Sydney what did you
            do?
                         SYDNEY
            I found Madison's medical files at
            Simion Hill.
Sydney looks through the dates labeled on the VHS tapes, and
picks the earliest one dated. RAVINA MAY, July `85. She           
shoves it into the VCR and presses PLAY.
ON SCREEN
White noise, and then an image appears. The picture quality
is classic VHS. Analogue and shitty. TIME STAMP: 7/23/85
It's a LOCKED OFF SHOT of a desk in a bland looking office.
DR. FLORENCE WEAVER enters FRAME and takes a seat behind the
desk. She's 30 years younger.
                        DR. WEAVER
            Today, we'll be speaking to the
            subjects' mother. Ravina May.                         
            Fifteen years of age. Poor girl was
            raped, and carried her pregnancy to
            term. She has decided to entrust
            her offsprings to us, and I gotta
            say, I have never seen anything
            quite like this. It would benefit
            our studies immensely.
                                                         88.

She steps up to the CAMERA, reaches out to stop the
recording, and the image RASTERS TO ANOTHER IMAGE:
We're now looking at a small, sickly young woman, 15.   This
is RAVINA ROSE. She looks exhausted.
Dr. Weaver interviews Ravina from OFF CAMERA.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Now are you sure you want to do
          this, Ravina?
Ravina shifts in her seat, deliberating on this question.
There's sadness in her eyes.
                       DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          It's okay.   There's no judgement
          here.
After a long beat of silence, she finally nods "yes", but she
starts to get emotional.
                       RAVINA
          I don't know how to look after them
          on my own. Mama doesn't want to
          help me. She called my pregnancy an
          act of transgression against God,
          and the birth of Gabrielle an                          
          abomination. I don't know what else
          to do, Doctor --
              (whispering)
          -- she scares me.                                      
She breaks down, crying.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          I think you're doing the right
          thing, Ravina. We'll take good care
          of them here. This is what we do.
          We'll give them the medical
          attention they need. You can have
          peace of mind knowing they'll be
          safe here.
Ravina stifles her sobbing. Dr Weaver's words feel assuring.
She looks up with teary eyes.
                      RAVINA
          Please take care of Emily?
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          Yes. We will.
              (beat)
          Now we just have some paperwork
          we'll need you and your mother to
          sign. Authorizing the subjects be
          placed under the care and
          supervision of Simion Hill Medical
          Clinic.
                                                             89.

The teenager CLOSES HER EYES, as we --
                                                     DISSOLVE TO:
The CLOSED EYES on the battered face of the KIDNAPPED WOMAN.
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
She's lying in a hospital bed, plugged to an IV drip, a
breathing tube running into her nostril, and hooked up to a
heart-monitor.
                        ERIK (O.C.)
            Is she awake?
A NURSE is checking up on the patient.
                         NURSE
            No.   Still in a coma.
The Nurse leaves, leaving Detective Erik standing alone,
trying to figure out how this Jane Doe fits into all of this.
Regina hurries into the room, CARRYING A WOMAN'S PURSE,              
puffing with excitement.
                        REGINA                                       
            We found her car in a towing yard.
            Towed from a "No Parking" spot five
            blocks from Madison Mitchell's
            house. Here's her purse. The ID
            matches our Jane Doe.
Regina hands the purse over to Erik. He looks at her                 
driver's license. Her name: RAVINA MAY. She's now 45 years           
old.
                          ERIK
            Ravina May.                                              
The wheels in Erik's head turn.      Realization hits him.
                        ERIK (CONT'D)
            I think this is Madison's biological
            mother.
INT. JEANNE'S HOME - STOREROOM - NIGHT
Sydney ejects that tape, and shoves in another one. This one
is labeled: EMILY MAY, August, `92                                   
ON SCREEN
The footage is BLURRY until an unseen hand adjusts the focus.
The image tears and futz. TIME STAMP: 8/15/92
It's a CLOSE UP of YOUNG EMILY/MADISON, 7. She looks pale,
haunted, and somewhat sleepy. But most of all, scared.
                                                      90.

Dr. Weaver interviews her from OFF CAMERA:
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          Emily are you OK?
Young Emily shakes her head, "NO."
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Are you scared?
Young Emily nods, "YES."
                        DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Don't be.    He's asleep.
Young Emily looks really nervous.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          I promise, she won't wake up and                   
          hear us. We gave him a heavy dose
          of sedative. That's why you're
          feeling sleepy too.
              (beat)
          We just want a private moment with
          you without Gabrielle listening in.                
              (beat)
          We've noticed in recent weeks,
          you've become more aggressive. Can
          you tell us why?
                      YOUNG EMILY
          She's been telling me to do things.                
          Bad things.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          What kind of things?
Young Emily hesitates.    Getting more afraid.
                         DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          It's okay.     Take your time.
                      YOUNG EMILY
          To hurt people.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          Is that why you attack Bobby
          Lambert?
Young Emily nods "YES."
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          But Bobby is nearly twice your size.
          That must have taken a lot of
          strength.
                                                          91.

                       YOUNG EMILY
          Gabrielle makes me strong.                             
              (scared and ashamed)
          She told me to kill Bobby.                             
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.)
          She actually said those words?                         
Young Emily stares at the ground, haunted.
                       YOUNG EMILY
          Sometimes she speaks words. Other                      
          times, her words are in my head.                       
          And then -- they weren't really like
          words anymore. Just feelings. I
          don't know how to say it. But I
          knew what she wanted me to do.                         
              (looks up)
          She pretends to be nice. But he's                      
          the Devil.
Dr. Weaver takes a beat, then steps into FRAME.   She
addresses the CAMERA OPERATOR.
                      DR. WEAVER
          OK. I'm gonna wake her up. You                         
          come around after I inject her.                        
The Camera Operator WIDENS THE SHOTS, revealing that Young
Emily is sitting on an exam table, wearing a MEDICAL GOWN
(the type with the open-back).
Dr. Weaver picks up a syringe, goes to the back of Young
Emily, we don't see what she does (but she's injecting the
needle into the back of Emily's head).
The Camera Operator picks up the CAMERA and goes HANDHELD,
circling around Young Emily to reveal behind her back:
A FACE IS EMBEDDED INTO THE BACK OF EMILY'S HEAD, PARTING HER
HAIR. THE EYES ARE BULGING. TWO ARMS PROTRUDE OUT OF             
EMILY'S BACK.   A most extreme case of teratoma deformity.       
This is GABRIELLE.   Her sister.                                 
Gabrielle lurches awake from the injection, shrilling an         
animalistic shriek. Young Emily winces, crying, as Gabrielle     
struggles.
ON SYDNEY AND JEANNE
They both gawk in UTTER HORROR.    Sydney covers her mouth,
shocked.
                       SYDNEY
          Oh my God.
                       JEANNE
          Madi!
                                                           92.

ON SCREEN
The VHS CAMERA moves closer to Gabrielle, until the twin          
fills the frame.
Sydney and Jeanne watch, horrified, as Gabrielle SCREAMS,         
revealing a mouth full of jagged, sparse teeth. Her tiny          
arms flail around like a trapped animal.
                        DR. WEAVER
            Gabrielle, please calm down.                          
THE IMAGE CHANGES. We're back in Dr. Weaver's office.   She
looks serious. Takes her time.
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)
            What exactly is Gabrielle?                            
She thinks about this rhetorical question.
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)
            Gabrielle is an extreme version of                    
            Teratoma. Which is a tumor
            consisting of tissues, hair, teeth,
            muscles, bones. But more
            specifically in this case, a
            "parasitic twin." That is when two
            embryos develop in the womb, but do
            not split as they should. One twin
            is dominant, while the other is
            underdeveloped. It's not conjoined
            because the underdeveloped twin is
            dependent on the body of the other.
            Like a parasite.
INT. PRECINCT - FEMALE HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME
WE PUSH IN ON MADISON.
                        DR. WEAVER (V.O.)
            In the case of Emily. Gabrielle is                    
            more than just a physical
            malignancy.
She sits alone in a corner of the holding cell, terrified.
The female FELONS eye her, sneering. A female ALPHA
GANGBANGER moves in, leaning over, getting in Madison's face.
                        ALPHA GANGBANGER
            What's wrong, Pollyanna? You get
            lost on the way to the country club?
There are LAUGHS. Madison shifts, uncomfortable. She
doesn't make eye contact, hoping the gangbanger will go away.
Alpha doesn't move. She sits next to Madison, invading her
space.

                        ALPHA GANGBANGER (CONT'D)
            So you ain't gonna say nothin' like
            I'm not here? Didn't your parents
            teach you that shit's rude.
                        MADISON
                (low)
            I don't want to talk.
                        ALPHA GANGBANGER
            What?
                        MADISON
            Please leave me alone.
                        ALPHA GANGBANGER
            I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU WANT.
It's a sudden, terrifying shift. Madison scrambles up,
trying to walk away. A BETA GANGBANGER steps in her path.
She shakes her head: Nope.

EMILY AND GABRIELLE - MORE TEST, September, `92                    
ON SCREEN
TIME STAMP: 9/16/92
Now, we're with Dr. Weaver looking through a glass window
into the exam room, and it's a YOUNGER DR. VICTOR FIELDS
conducting a test.
                        DR. WEAVER
            Currently, my colleague, Dr. Fields,
            is testing the connective vision
            between the teratoma and it's twin.
Gabrielle faces Dr. Fields, Madison faces away. Dr. Fields         
holds up a CARD with an APPLE on it. Gabrielle eyes the            
card, her eyeball protruding out of its socket.                    
                        MADISON
            Apple.
Dr. Fields holds up another card for Gabrielle.     It's a PIG.

Sydney watches, rapt.   Horror has given way to fascination.
                        JEANNE
            How is she doing that?

Dr. Fields goes through more cards, showing them to Gabrielle        
as Madison correctly names all of them. Dr. Weaver turns to
CAMERA.
                        DR. WEAVER
            So the latest development is --
            Emily claims that Gabrielle is able                      
            to cloud her mind. Make her see
            things. Or make her believe she's
            somewhere else.

Stunned to hear this.
INT. PRECINCT - FEMALE HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME
Alpha shoves Madison back into a corner.      Everyone else moves
out of the way.
                        MADISON
            Why are you doing this?
                        ALPHA GANBANGER
            Why? Because you're weak, bitch.
            And in here it's survival of the
            fittest. But I'm willing play nice
            for a price. What you got?
                        MADISON
            I don't have anything they took
            everything.
More laughter.
                        ALPHA GANBANGER
            That's cute. What'd you do to get
            in here, forget to separate the
            recycling?
                        MADISON
            Just leave me alone.
Something in Madison snaps and she PUSHES the alpha back and
from there it's ON.
                        MADISON (CONT'D)
            GUAR--
                                                           95.

She doesn't finish. The Alpha PUNCHES Madison in her gut,
doubling her over. Madison can't catch her breath before the
Beta sucker punches her. The other felons CHEER from the
sidelines, enjoying the break in monotony.
Madison is no match for the two gangbangers. She falls to
the floor, pulling herself into a fetal position, protecting
her head. They beat her up, kicking and punching.
                        ALPHA GANBANGER
            Get this bitch up.
Beta snatches Madison up, throwing her against the wall, the
back of her head SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, bouncing off it --
                                                    SMASHCUT:
To the exact same thing that happened when -- Derek SLAMS
Madison's head against the wall at the start of the story.
Cracking open her skull. The inciting incident that

GABRIELLE'S FACE fills the screen, SCREECHING HEINOUSLY.          
Emily's eyes roll backwards, as Gabrielle takes over her          
body. She -- HITS, STRIKES, KICKS -- without emotion on her
face. HER ARMS POP AND TWIST BACKWARDS LIKE SHE'S DOUBLE-
JOINTED.
TWO ORDERLIES struggle to hold down the eight-year-old girl.
                        DR. WEAVER
            GABRIELLE STOP! STOP IT NOW!                          
DR. JOHN GREGORY brings out two electrodes that look like
jump-start cables, and attaches them to Gabrielle's head.         
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)
            DR. GREGORY, ADMINISTER HIGH
            VOLTAGE!
Dr. Gregory cranks up the dial. Gabrielle screams, as smoke       
emanates from him, causing the LIGHTS TO FLICKER, and then
EXPLODING! Everything electronic malfunctions and short-
circuits. The camera itself can barely focus.
                        DR. GREGORY
            Holy shit -- Gabrielle is doing                       
            this!
                        DR. WEAVER
            Get the goddamn sedative!

            Do it!   NOW!
Dr. Weaver and Dr. Gregory hold Madison's arms as Victor
injects the sedative.
THE FOOTAGE CHANGES -- the chaos abruptly ends. We're back
in Dr. Weaver's office. She's behind her desk, looking
haggard.
                        DR. WEAVER (CONT'D)
            We witnessed something rather
            disturbing during the teratoma's
            meltdown. Gabrielle displayed the                        
            ability to temporarily take over the
            motor functions of the host.
            Attempt at electric shock therapy

            fight back any more?
SUDDENLY -- THE LIGHTS AROUND THEM START FLICKERING.
Everyone looks around, wondering what the fuck is happening.

            She having a seizure or something?
Alpha feels something against her hand -- the back of
Madison's head is SHIFTING, something is BUBBLING UNDER HER
HAIR. Alpha snatches her hand away.
                        ALPHA GANBANGER
            What the fuck --
Madison drops to her knees, facing away from everyone.

                                                           97.

A SURGERY ROOM. Madison, unconscious, lies face down on the
operating table, her back exposed and HER HAIR SHAVED OFF,
prepped for surgery.
Dr. Weaver, in her surgical gown, speaks to the CAMERA.
                      DR. WEAVER
          Teratoma's parasitic nature has
          increased as it's now siphoning more
          fluids and nutrients, resulting in
          weight loss. If this continues it
          could lead to organ failure for
          Emily. Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory and
          myself have concluded that the only
          way to save Emily, is to excise the
          teratoma.
Dr. Gregory hands Dr. Weaver an AMPUTATION KNIFE -- the same
kind Gabrielle modified and used as his weapon.                   
Though it's only 30 years in the past, the surgery feels
archaic, primitive.
VHS CAMERA PUSHES IN on Gabrielle.   Her eye is closed.   Her     
mouth hangs open, drooling.
                      DR. WEAVER (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Teratoma is conjoined within the
          brain. Full removal could kill the
          patient or result in permanent brain
          damage.
Dr. Weaver brings the knife down, ready to make the first
incision --
GABRIELLE'S EYE POP OPEN.                                         
Everyone -- including Sydney and Jeanne -- SCREAM.
INT. PRECINCT - FEMALE HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME
While on her knees, Madison reaches behind her head with both
hands, and HER FINGERS DIG INTO THE CRACK IN HER SKULL,
PULLING AT THE OPENING -- WIDENING THE GAP (note: most of
this is covered up by her hair). Screaming in pain.
                      DR. WEAVER (V.O.)
          Course of action is to open the
          skull and suppress the tissue --
          Gabrielle's face -- within the head.                    
Everyone watches, shocked, as A FACE PUSHES through Madison's
hair. One protruding eye, a mouth full of jagged, sharp
teeth.
NOW, HERE, GABRIELLE FINALLY REVEALS HIMSELF OUT OF THE BACK      
OF MADISON'S HEAD -- snarling!
                                                           98.

Everyone in the cell shuffles back, freaked-the-fuck-out by
what they're seeing.
SOUNDS OF POPPING AND CRACKING BONES as Gabrielle takes over      
Madison's body CONTORTING her LIMBS, her FINGERS AND HER
FEET, so that every part of her body WORKS BACKWARDS. It's
horrifying to witness.
Gabrielle LUNGES for Beta, gripping Beta's face in her            
twisted hands. CRUSHING BETA'S SKULL and SNAPPING HER NECK.       
And then all hell breaks loose.
                        ALPHA GANBANGER
            Yo, get a fuckin' guard in here!
            GUARD!
Everyone starts SCREAMING for the guard.
With superhuman speed Gabrielle uses Madison's body IN            
REVERSE, operating BACKWARDS, taking out each inmate,
breaking bones, smashing heads and ripping throats. She's         
like a hurricane of blood and guts, tearing each person apart
limb from limb.
We INTERCUT the bloodbath with:

a tear streams down Sydney's face. It's heartbreaking to
learn this about her sister.

Dr. Weaver has removed what she could of Gabrielle's head,        
leaving only a nascent face. She gently presses down on
Gabrielle's face, PUSHING IT INSIDE MADISON'S SKULL.              
                         DR. WEAVER

          Erik! Listen -- Gabrielle is inside                     
          of Madison. She's been using her

          Whoa -- Sydney, you're not making
          any sense??
                      SYDNEY
          I found Madison's history. She was
          born with a "parasitic twin."
          Gabrielle has been dormant inside                       
          her this whole time. I believe when
          Madison was pregnant, she was                           
          siphoning nutrients and fluids from
          the baby to regenerate herself. The                     
          night Derek died, Madison told me
          Derek smashed the back of her head
          against the wall. I think that
          incident woke Gabrielle --                              
Erik tries to understand what Sydney is telling him --
                                                        100.

Just as the gun's clip empties, Gabrielle reaches the bars.      
Her hand LASHES OUT, grabbing the guard's shirt.                 
Gabrielle yanks the guard forward, slamming the guard's face     
into the bars over and over and over again until the guard's
face is PULP.
Gabrielle reaches her right hand (Madison's left, backwards)     
through the bars, into the guard's waistband, tearing the
KEYS free. Gabrielle lets herself out of the cell.               
TWO COPS rush into the hallway. They see Gabrielle in the        
strobing light, temporarily thrown by the unnerving sight.
One pulls her gun -- Gabrielle DUCKS down, bum rushing her.      
She twists her around, forcing her to SHOOT the other cop in     
the face.
Gabrielle TWITS the female cop down at an unnatural angle,       
BREAKING HER BACK.
MORE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES rush to the scene and Gabrielle     
moves through them, KILLING them in a bloodbath.

In the   back she finds the evidence box with her KNIFE and      
TRENCH   COAT. She pulls them out of the bag, slipping her       
trench   coat on. She grips the blade in her hand. Feels         
good.    Blade ready, she steps out.                             
ON MADISON'S FACE
We PUSH INTO HER ROLLED BACK EYES -- going inside her head,
and pulling back out to reveal:
Madison is still sitting in the cell. All the gangbangers
and felons are also around. Except now, none of them are
hassling her. They leave Madison the hell alone.
This is a VISION. This is what he's wants her to see. A
FIGMENT of Gabrielle's psychic creation. Her mind's safe         
here.
BACK TO THE CARNAGE IN THE REAL WORLD
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - SAME TIME
Erik and Regina come charging in to a cacophony of GUNSHOTS      
and BLOOD CURDLING SCREAMS.
A COP staggers into the doorway.   He FALLS to the floor,
dead. His face torn off.
                                                         102.

                         REGINA                                  
          Fuck me --
THE LIGHTS BEGIN SURGING.    They BURST, raining down sparks
and shards over the room.
Everyone DUCKS.
It's all Gabrielle needs.                                        
She enters the room like a whirlwind, slicing and stabbing       
through cops before most of them can get off a shot. She         
steps over bodies without breaking his stride.
Erik's eyes go wide when he sees Gabrielle tearing through       
the room. It's a lot to process with no time. Erik FIRES
off shots to no avail. Gabrielle's too fast.                     
Erik keeps trying, turning with Gabrielle as she moves           
through the room, leading Erik too --
Lieutenant Daniels. Gabrielle GRABS him, SHOVING him into        
the path of Erik's shots. Daniels takes a few slugs to the
chest, DROPPING. Erik lowers his weapon, shocked.
Erik is lost in his shock as Gabrielle moves toward him.         
                         REGINA (CONT'D)                         
          Shaw!
Regina FIRES -- in a split second Gabrielle BENDS BACKWARDS      
(in Madison's case, forwards) dodging the shot.
Gabrielle FLIPS UP, KICKING Regina under the chin so hard it     
BREAKS REGINA'S TEETH. Regina staggers back. Erik tries to       
get off a shot but with superhuman strength Gabrielle FLIPS a    
DESK on him, crushing Erik underneath from the waist down.
There's no one left.    Gabrielle has taken out the entire       
police precinct.
Erik watches, helpless, sees MADISON'S FACE, twisted in a
rictus of anguish.
Under the weight of the desk, Erik grunts, straining to talk.
                         ERIK
          Madison.     Madison!
                      GABRIELLE                                  
          SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU, DETECTIVE.
ON MADISON, eyes rolling around, as if in REM sleep.
Gabrielle presses her foot against Erik's face. Erik winces      
as Gabrielle's foot bears down on his nose. There's a sharp,     
sick SNAP as Erik's nose BREAKS. Erik howls in pain.             
                                                       103.

                      GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                       
          THIS IS ONLY A TASTE OF THE PAIN I
          FELT, DETECTIVE.
Gabrielle leaves, escaping into the night.                     
INT. SYDNEY'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
Sydney drives like a bat out of hell, pulling up to the        
police station. Before the car has fully stopped she jumps
out, running inside.
INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - NIGHT
Sydney enters. She's hit by the sight of the carnage,
aghast. O.S. Erik MOANS. Sydney follows the noise, landing
next to Erik.
                        SYDNEY
          Oh my God.
Sydney struggles, but manages to push the desk off of Erik.    
Sydney helps him sit up. Erik talks through the pain.          
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          What happened?
                      ERIK
          You're right. Madison -- she's                       
          Gabrielle. How's that possible?                      
                      SYDNEY
          Where is she -- they?
Erik shakes his head.
                        ERIK
          They left.
                        SYDNEY
          Fuck!
                      ERIK
          I think I know where they're going.
          The hospital. The woman whom
          Madison -- Gabrielle -- kidnapped,                   
          is Ravina May.                                       
Sydney's eyes light up.   And together in synch:
                      SYDNEY/ERIK
          Their mother.
                      ERIK
          She's going after her. But don't                     
          go, Sydney. It's too dangerous.
                                                          104.

                      SYDNEY
          I have to. I'm the only one who can
          reach out to her.
                      ERIK
          It's not her anymore.     Your sister
          is gone.
Sydney stands.
                      SYDNEY
          Madison is still in there.
She's made up her mind.   Erik pushes himself up.                 
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?                                     
                       ERIK
          Coming with you.                                        
              (off her look)                                      
          You need backup.                                        
EXT. PRECINCT - NIGHT                                             
Sydney and Erik hurry to the parking lot, Erik limping.           
Sydney goes for her car. Erik stops her.                          
                       ERIK                                       
          Hey.                                                    
              (tosses her his keys)                               
          Mine.                                                   
Sydney and Erik get into his police cruiser. Sydney drives.       
She starts the car. Erik throws on the siren. Sydney books        
it out of the parking lot.                                        
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   
A UNIFORMED OFFICER sits, guarding the patient's room.            
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT                              
Jane Doe, now RAVINA KIRK, lies in bed, sleeping.   Her           
wrists are bandaged. Her heart monitor is steady.                 
The lights in the room FLICKER. Outside, the guard turns.         
Ravina continues sleeping. He turns back.                         
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                             
Gabrielle, face obscured by her hoodie and trench coat,           
enters through the automatic doors.                               
INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - NIGHT                                 
It's late, only a light graveyard shift. Gabrielle                
approaches the reception desk. A NURSE sits at the desk.          
She looks up, her eyes going wide when she sees Gabrielle.        
                                                       105.

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT                                 
The uniformed officer is at his post. At the end of the         
hallway, the lights FLICKER. Gabrielle steps in, knife          
gripped in her hand. It's dripping blood. The Uniformed         
officer is up, reaching for his weapon.                         
                      UNIFORMED OFFICER                         
          STOP RIGHT THERE.                                     
Gabrielle steps forward -- the LIGHT ABOVE HER GOES OUT,        
plunging her into darkness. Her FOOTSTEPS echo off the          
floor. With every step another block of LIGHTS GO OUT,          
keeping Gabrielle hidden.                                       
                         UNIFORMED OFFICER (CONT'D)             
          I SAID STOP!                                          
But she keeps coming. Closer... closer... Darkness coming       
for the uniformed officer.                                      
                       UNIFORMED OFFICER (CONT'D)               
          STOP!   OR I WILL SHOOT YOU!                          
THE LIGHT ABOVE HIM GOES OUT. The only illumination from        
Ravina's room. He's terrified, heart in his throat. Where       
is she? The officer pulls up his radio.                         
                      UNIFORMED OFFICER (CONT'D)                
          This is officer Panduro, I need                       
          backup--                                              
THWIP                                                           
The glint of the blade. With a quick motion it slices across    
his throat. Blood pours from his neck. He DROPS.                
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT                            
The door opens. Gabrielle, face hidden by her hair, steps       
out of the darkness into the room. She stands over Ravina's     
bed. ELECTRICITY crackles through the room. Ravina's hair       
charges, standing on end. She blinks, coming too. She sees      
Gabrielle. The heart monitor BEEPS FASTER, reflecting the       
sudden elevation of her heart rate.                             
                         RAVINA                                 
          No...                                                 
Gabrielle GRIPS HER FACE.                                       
                         GABRIELLE                              
          SHHHHHHHH.                                            
Gabrielle removes her hand, pressing a finger to Ravina's       
lips. Ravina shakes, crying.                                    
                      RAVINA                                    
          What do you want from me?                             
                                                       106.

Gabrielle pushes her hair back, revealing her twisted face.     
Now Ravina starts to panic, hear heart rate going even          
faster. It's like she's looking at a ghost.                     
                         RAVINA (CONT'D)                        
          Gabrielle.                                            
                      GABRIELLE                                 
          HELLO, MOTHER. MISS ME?                               
No she has not. Right now Ravina's scared to death.   She       
knows why Gabrielle's here.                                     
                        RAVINA                                  
          I'm sorry.    I'm so, so sorry.                       
                         GABRIELLE                              
          ARE YOU NOW?     FOR WHAT?                            
                      RAVINA                                    
          For leaving you. Giving you to                        
          those doctors. I was so scared. I                     
          didn't know what else to do. The                      
          moment I left I knew it was wrong.                    
          I've lived with that regret ever                      
          since.                                                
She sounds sincere. Gabrielle softens, looking down at her      
mother. There's pity in her eyes. She gently wipes away her     
mother's tears.                                                 
EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT                                           
Sydney whips Erik's cruiser into the unloading zone. She        
gets out, rushing around to the passenger side as Erik gets     
out. She helps him out. Together they rush inside.              
INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS                          
Erik and Sydney race in. The reception desk is covered in       
BLOOD. The nurse's body is slumped in her chair, a deep gash    
in her chest. The hallway is littered with DEAD BODIES.         
Anyone who tried to get in Gabrielle's way. Sydney is           
stunned, sickened by what she sees.                             
                         SYDNEY                                 
          Jesus.                                                
Erik he moves down the hall.      Sydney follows.               
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT                            
Gabrielle stands over Ravina, conflicted for the first time.    
Carefully, no sudden movements, Ravina sits up. She touches     
Gabrielle's face tenderly. Motherly.                            
                                                         107.

                      RAVINA                                     
          I'm so sorry for what they did to                      
          you. All that pain. I don't blame                      
          you, Gabrielle.                                        
Gabrielle reacts to this.   Touched.   Having longed for a       
mother's love.                                                   
                      GABRIELLE                                  
          IT'S NOT MY FAULT.                                     
                     RAVINA                                      
          I know. I know. You don't have to                      
          do this.                                               
The door BURSTS OPEN, Sydney and Erik rushing in.                
Sydney sees Madison, her sister's face, twisted, eyes rolled     
to the back of her head. Her mouth drops in SHOCK at the         
frightening sight.                                               
                      SYDNEY                                     
          MADISON!                                               
                      ERIK                                       
          GET AWAY FROM HER!                                     
It's already chaos. Enraged, Gabrielle GRABS Ravina, ripping     
her out of the bed, she puts the helpless woman between them.    
                      SYDNEY                                     
          Madison.                                               
Gabrielle sneers at Sydney.                                      
                      SYDNEY (CONT'D)                            
          Madison, are you there?                                
                      GABRIELLE                                  
          MADISON'S NOT HERE.                                    
Sydney circles around Gabrielle, trying to see Madison's         
face. She catches a brief glimpse before Gabrielle turns,        
making sure she's always facing her.                             
                      SYDNEY                                     
          What have you done to my sister?                       
                      GABRIELLE                                  
          SHE'S NOT YOUR SISTER. SHE NEVER                       
          WAS. SHE'S MINE. AND I'M NOT GOING                     
          TO LOSE HER AGAIN.

She opens her eyes. PULL BACK TO reveal she's sitting in her
chair, in her nursery. She blinks, confused. Wasn't she
just somewhere else?                                                
She was. This is Gabrielle's MENTAL CONSTRUCT.        Gabrielle     
has put Madison in another fantasy.                                 
Derek enters.    Alive.   Nice.                                     
                          DEREK
          Hey.
She should be surprised to see him, but she's not.                  
                      DEREK (CONT'D)                                
          I'm going on a grocery run.       Text if                 
          you need anything.                                        
A BABY coos. Madison moves to the crib. She looks down on --  
                                                              
a BABY GIRL. Plump, rosy cheeks, a smile. Her daughter.
Alive. Madison eyes her child with a mother's wonder.         
                      MADISON
          I have everything I need.
Derek leaves. Madison takes her daughter in her arms,               
cradling her, smelling her head.                                    
                        SYDNEY (O.S.)                               
          Madison!    Madison please!                               
Madison turns.                                                      
                          MADISON                                   
          Sydney?                                                   
The baby's coos STOP.     Madison looks down -- the baby is         
gone.                                                               
                        SYDNEY (O.S.)                               
          Madison!    Wherever you are, it's not                    
          real!                                                     
Madison turns to the sound.       She gets up, following.           
INT. MITCHELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - FANTASY                          
Madison lands at the bottom. The front door is open. But            
outside, she can see the HOSPITAL ROOM. Sydney tries to talk        
to her.                                                             
                      SYDNEY                                        
          Madison please, I know you can hear                       
          me. You have to fight her.                                
It hits Madison --                                                  
                          MADISON                                   
          Gabrielle.                                                
                                                         109.

Madison bolts for the door -- IT SLAMS SHUT.   Madison pulls       
on the handle.                                                     
                       MADISON (CONT'D)                            
          GABRIELLE!   LET ME OUT!                                 
Madison struggles to get the door open. She pulls with             
everything she's got. The FRONT DOOR GIVES. Just as                
Madison's about to open it --                                      
SHE'S GRABBED, THROWN TO THE FLOOR.    Derek stands over her.      
                      DEREK                                        
          You're not going anywhere.                               
Derek GRABS Madison, throwing her against the wall.                
                                                INTERCUT WITH:     
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT'S ROOM                                     
Madison MOANS, in pain.  Gabrielle struggles to keep               
control. Erik trades a look with Sydney. Now.                      
Sydney RUSHES Gabrielle, but Gabrielle is too fast. Her,           
LEFT ARM CATCHES SYDNEY BY THE THROAT. Gabrielle has Ravina        
in one hand and Sydney in the other. Gabrielle makes sure to       
keep Ravina in front, preventing Erik from a clear shot.           
                       GABRIELLE                                   
              (to Erik)                                            
          DROP THE GUN OR I KILL THEM BOTH.                        
          DROP IT.                                                 
Erik drops the gun.                                                
                       GABRIELLE (CONT'D)                          
          OUT.                                                     
                       ERIK                                        
          Fuck you.                                                
Gabrielle squeezes Ravina's throat.    She's turning blue.         
Erik slowly backs out of the room.                                 
With one THRUST Gabrielle KICKS Ravina, sending her flying         
into Erik. They collapse in the hallway. With a quick move         
Gabrielle kicks the door closed, LOCKING it.                       
It's just her and Sydney now.    Gabrielle picks up Eriks' gun,    
turning it on Sydney --                                            
WITH MADISON                                                       
Derek holds down Madison, gripping her wrists. He speaks with      
Gabrielle's voice.                                                 
                                                           110.

                      DEREK                                         
          YOU WERE ALWAYS WEAK.     YOU WERE                        
          NOTHING WITHOUT ME.                                       
                        SYDNEY                                      
          MADISON!                                                  
Gabrielle pistol whips her, knocking her unconscious. Erik          
throws himself into the door, trying to break it down.              
Gabrielle SHOOTS, the bullet breaking through the glass             
window, barely missing Erik.                                        
WITH MADISON                                                        
She fights to get Derek off her.    Derek BEATS her head into       
the floor.                                                          
                      DEREK                                         
          YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCKING BITCH!    AFTER                    
          EVERYTHING I DID FOR YOU!                                 
Madison KICKS OUT, nailing Derek in the balls.                      
Derek -- and Gabrielle -- CRY OUT IN PAIN.                          
Madison scrambles up.   She stands over Derek.                      
                      MADISON                                       
          I'm done being your punching bag.                         
Derek smiles, LAUGHING.   His voice becomes Gabrielle's.            
                      DEREK                                         
          YOU'RE TOO LATE. I'M GOING TO MAKE                        
          YOU WATCH ME KILL HER.                                    
Derek DISAPPEARS.    Gabrielle and Sydney appear in his place.      
Gabrielle presses the gun to Sydney's temple.      Sydney starts    
coming too.                                                         
                        SYDNEY                                      
          Madison!                                                  
Madison turns -- the front door is wide open. Madison DIVES         
through the front door, out of the fantasy and into --              
ON MADISON'S FACE                                                   
The real Madison. Her eyes roll back down. She's coming out         
of it. She GASPS for air, re-taking her body.                       
                        GABRIELLE                                   
          NO!                                                       
Madison pulls her arms back. The gun is in her hand.                
Madison turns to her sister, tears in her eyes.                     
                                                        111.

                      MADISON                                    
          I'm so, so sorry Sydney. I've spent                    
          my whole life yearning for a blood                     
          tie. For that special connection.                      
          And yet in the end, what mattered                      
          the most was right front of me the                     
          whole time. You'll always be my                        
          sister. And I'll always love you.                      
Madison aims the gun to the back of her head -- to Gabrielle.    
Sydney realizes what Madison's about to do--                     
                      SYDNEY                                     
          MADISON, NO!--                                         
She pulls the trigger -- BOOM.   The blast blows out the back    
of Madison's head.                                               
Sydney SCREAMS. Erik breaks into the room. He goes to            
Madison, checking her pulse. Blood pools from the back of        
her head... O.S. we hear the wail of SIRENS.                     
INT. NEW AGE MENTAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY
Sydney, accompanied by Erik, walks down the hall. They stop      
before a WINDOW. The curtain to the window is down. The          
CRANIAL SURGEON, 50s.                                            
                      ERIK                                       
          You sure you want to do this today?                    
Sydney nods.                                                     
                      CRANIAL SURGEON                            
          Ms. Lake, Detective.                                   
                        SYDNEY                                   
          How is she?                                            
                      CRANIAL SURGEON                            
          She's having a better day today.                       
          But we're worried about cognitive                      
          functions.                                             
                      SYDNEY                                     
          I want to see her.                                     
The surgeon presses a button. The curtain RISES, revealing       
MADISON in a PADDED ROOM. She's facing the wall, making          
circles with her finger. She's alive, her head SHAVED, a         
long SURGICAL SCAR running across the back of her head.          
Madison stares into space, childlike, mumbling to herself.       
Sydney sucks in her breath, seeing her sister for the first      
time. It's a lot to take. Erik holds her hand, reassuring.       
                                                         112.

                      CRANIAL SURGEON                            
          We've done everything we can to
          repair the nerve damage, but, as you
          know it's extensive. She's lucky
          she survived at all.
                      ERIK                                       
          What about her... twin?   Gabrielle?                   
                       CRANIAL SURGEON
          So far we've seen no activity from
          the teratoma. There's no indication
          it survived.

          But she's still in my sister.                          
                      CRANIAL SURGEON
          Pieces of it, yes. To preserve what
          we could of her brain we had to
          leave some tissue in tact.
Madison looks to the window. She WAVES at Sydney, like an
excited little kid. Sydney gives her a sad wave back.
                      SYDNEY
          Does she remember anything?
                      CRANIAL SURGEON
          She didn't remember how to walk.
          She's having to learn everything
          over again. We'll do everything we                     
          can, but, Ms. Lake, you have to                        
          prepare for the possibility this
          will be the permanent state for your
          sister.
It hangs there.   Sydney is heartbroken.                         
                      ERIK                                       
          You've done everything you can.                        
Sydney nods, but it's of little comfort. An ORDERLY enters,      
carrying a tray of food -- chicken nuggets, fries. All           
finger foods.                                                    
                      CRANIAL SURGEON                            
          She needs her lunch.                                   
Sydney looks to her sister, waiving.    Through the window       
Madison WAVES.
                         MADISON
          Bye-bye.                                               
INT. PADDED ROOM - DAY
Madison watches Sydney and the cranial surgeon leave.   The      
orderly enters. He sets down the tray.                           
                                                       113.

                      ORDERLY                                   
          Hey, Madison. Lunch time. Brought                     
          your favorite.                                        
Madison doesn't look at him, acknowledge him at all. She        
stares off into space, smiling. The orderly stands, leaving.    
                      ORDERLY (CONT'D)                          
          Eat it before it gets cold.                           
                      MADISON                                   
          Bye-bye                                               
The lights start FLICKERING. The orderly looks to the           
lights. Weird. He leaves. Madison stares up, like a child       
watching something sparkly. She lets out a noise, happy.        
The lights FLICKER again, getting stronger, brighter.           
There's an electrical HUM in the air. Like something gaining    
strength.                                                       
Just when we think they're about to pop they -- BLINKING US     
TO BLACK.
