1        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE - 1926 - NIGHT                                   1

         A large, isolated, derelict chateau emerges from the
         darkness. We focus on a cobbled square outside the building
         shrouded in mist, eerie, silent.

         FIVE AURORS stand, wands aloft, tentative as they edge
         towards the chateau. A sudden explosion of pure white light
         sends them flying.

         WE WHIP ROUND: to find their bodies scattered, lying
         motionless at the entrance to a large parkland. A figure
         (GRINDELWALD) enters the frame, his back to the camera;
         ignoring the bodies, he stares out into the night sky, as we:

         PAN UP TOWARDS THE MOON.

         MONTAGE:

         WE SEE various magical newspaper headlines from 1926 relating
         to GRINDELWALD'S attacks all over the world:

         'GRINDELWALD STRIKES AGAIN IN EUROPE',

         'HOGWARTS SCHOOL INCREASES SECURITY',

         'WHERE IS GRINDELWALD?'.

         He's a serious threat to the magical community and he's
         vanished.

         MOVING PHOTOS detail destroyed buildings, fires, screaming
         victims. The articles come thick and fast � the worldwide
         hunt for GRINDELWALD continues.

         WE PUSH IN: on a final article displaying the STATUE OF
         LIBERTY.

                                                          TRANSITION TO:


2        EXT. SHIP GLIDING INTO NEW YORK - NEXT MORNING                            2

         A bright, clear New York day.

         Seagulls swoop overhead.

         A large passenger ship glides past the Statue of Liberty.
         Passengers lean over the rails, looking excitedly towards the
         oncoming land.




                                                                      (CONTINUED)

         PUSH IN: towards a figure sitting on a bench with his back to
         us � NEWT SCAMANDER, weather-beaten, wiry, wearing an old
         blue overcoat. Beside him rests a battered brown leather
         case. A catch on the case flicks open of its own accord. NEWT
         swiftly bends down to close it.

         Placing the case on his lap, NEWT leans in, whispering:

                                NEWT
                      Dougal � you settle down now,
                      please. It won't be long.

         AERIAL SHOT of New York.


4        EXT. SHIP/INT. CUSTOMS - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS - DAY                         4

         Among bustling crowds, NEWT walks down the gangplank of the
         ship, as we push in towards his case.

                                   CUSTOMS OFFICIAL (O.S.)
                      Next.

         NEWT stands at the Customs � a long row of desks by the
         shipyard, manned by serious-looking American officials.

         A CUSTOMS OFFICIAL examines NEWT'S very tattered British
         passport.

                                CUSTOMS OFFICIAL (CONT'D)
                      British, huh?

                                   NEWT
                      Yes.

                                CUSTOMS OFFICIAL

                      Yes.

                      Anything edible in there?

                                   NEWT
                              (placing a hand over his
                              breast pocket)
                      No.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

         The catch on NEWT'S case flicks open again. NEWT looks down
         and hastily closes it.

                                NEWT
                      Must get that fixed � ah, no.

                                CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
                           (suspicious)
                      Let me take a look.

         NEWT places the case on the desk between them and discreetly
         flicks a brass dial to 'MUGGLEWORTHY'.

         The CUSTOMS OFFICIAL spins the case towards him and pops the
         catches, lifting the lid to reveal pyjamas, various maps, a
         journal, an alarm clock, a magnifying glass and a Hufflepuff
         scarf. Finally satisfied, he closes the case.

                                CUSTOMS OFFICIAL (CONT'D)
                      Welcome to New York.

                                   NEWT
                      Thank you.

         NEWT gathers his passport and case.

                      Next!
         NEWT exits through Customs.


5        EXT. STREET NEAR CITY HALL SUBWAY - DUSK                                  5

         A long street of identical brownstone houses, one of which
         has been reduced to rubble.

         A gaggle of reporters and photographers mills around in the
         vague hope of something happening, but without much
         enthusiasm.

         One REPORTER is interviewing an excitable middle-aged man as
         they move through the rubble.

                                WITNESS
                      -and it was like a � like a wind or
                      like a � like a ghost � but dark �
                      and I saw its eyes � shinin' white
                      eyes--


                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                REPORTER
                           (expressionless �
                           notebook in his hand)
                      --a dark wind � with eyes...

                                WITNESS
                      --like a dark mass, and it dove
                      down there, down underground � I
                      swear to God... into the earth
                      right in front of me.

         CLOSE ON: PERCIVAL GRAVES as he walks towards the destroyed
         building.

         GRAVES: smart clothing, very handsome, early middle-age, his
         demeanour differs from those around him. He is watchful,
         tightly coiled, an air of intense confidence.

                                PHOTOGRAPHER
                           (sotto voce)
                      Hey � did you get anything?

                                REPORTER
                           (sotto voce)
                      Dark wind, blah blah.

                                PHOTOGRAPHER
                      It's some atmospheric hooey. Or
                      electrical.

         GRAVES moves up the steps of the now-ruined building. He
         examines the destruction, curious, alert.

                                REPORTER
                      Hey � you thirsty?

                                PHOTOGRAPHER
                      Nah, I'm on the wagon. Promised
                      Martha I'd lay off.

         The wind begins to pick up, swirling around the building,
         accompanied by a high-pitched screeching. GRAVES alone looks
         interested.

         A sudden series of bangs at street level. All turn to look
         for the source of the sound: a wall cracks, the rubble on the
         floor begins to shake before exploding like an earthquake,
         ripping out of the building and down through the middle of
         the street. The movement is violent, rushed � people and cars
         go flying.




                                                                      (CONTINUED)
 
                                                                              5.

         The mysterious force then flies up into the air, swirling
         through the city, diving in and out of alleyways, before
         crashing down into a subway station.

         CLOSE ON: GRAVES, as he examines the destruction of the
         street.

         A mingled roar and howl emanates from the bowels of the
         earth.


6        EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY                                                6

         WATCHING NEWT walk, we see in him an unselfconscious
         Keatonesque quality, a sense of a different rhythm to those
         around him. In his hand he clutches directions on a small
         piece of paper, but he still shows a scientist's curiosity
         about this alien environment.


7        EXT. ANOTHER STREET, STEPS OF THE CITY BANK - DAY                         7

         NEWT, intrigued by the noise of shouting, approaches a rally
         of the NEW SALEM PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY.

         MARY LOU BAREBONE, a handsome mid-western woman in a 1920s
         version of Puritan dress, charismatic and earnest, stands on
         a small stage at the steps to the City Bank.

         Behind her stands a man parading a banner emblazoned with the
         organisation's symbol: hands proudly grasping a broken wand
         amid bright yellow and red flames.

                               MARY LOU
                          (to the assembled crowd)
                     ... this great city sparkles with
                     the jewels of man's invention!
                     Movie theatres, automobiles, the
                     wireless, electric lights � all
                     dazzle and bewitch us!

         NEWT slows down and watches MARY LOU as he would observe a
         foreign species: no judgement, simply interest.

         Nearby stands TINA GOLDSTEIN, hat low on her head, upturned
         collar. She is eating a hot dog, mustard smeared on her upper
         lip.

         NEWT accidently bumps into her as he makes his way to the
         front of the rally.

                               NEWT
                     Oh... so sorry.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)
 
                                                                              6.
7        CONTINUED:                                                            7
                                MARY LOU
                      But where there is light there is
                      shadow, friend. Something is
                      stalking our city, wreaking
                      destruction and then disappearing
                      without a trace...

         JACOB KOWALSKI moves nervously down the street towards the
         crowd, wearing an ill-fitting suit and carrying a battered
         brown leather case.

                                MARY LOU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      We have to fight � join us, the
                      Second Salemers, in our fight!

         JACOB makes his way through the gathered crowd, also pushing
         past TINA.

                                JACOB
                      Excuse me doll, just trying to get
                      to the bank � excuse me � just
                      trying...

         JACOB trips over NEWT'S case, disappearing momentarily. NEWT
         hauls him up.

                                NEWT
                      I'm so sorry � my case-

                                JACOB
                      No harm done-
         JACOB struggles on, heading past MARY LOU and up the steps of
         the bank.

                                   JACOB (CONT'D)
                      Excuse me!

         The kerfuffle around NEWT draws MARY LOU'S attention.

                                MARY LOU
                           (charming, to NEWT)
                      You, friend! What drew you to our
                      meeting today?

         NEWT is startled to find himself the centre of attention.

                                NEWT
                      Oh... I was just... passing...

                                MARY LOU
                      Are you a seeker? A seeker after
                      truth?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

         A beat.

                               NEWT
                     I'm more of a chaser, really.

         ANGLE ON: people moving in and out of the bank.

         A smartly dressed man flips a dime towards a beggar sitting
         on the steps.

         CLOSE ON: the dime, falling in SLOW MOTION.

                                MARY LOU (O.S.)
                     Hear my words and heed my
                     warning...

         ANGLE ON: some little paws, which have appeared in the narrow
         crack between the lid and the body of NEWT'S case.

         ANGLE ON: the dime hitting the steps with a musical clang.

         ANGLE ON: the paws, now trying hard to prise open the case.

                               MARY LOU (CONT'D)
                     ... and laugh if you dare: witches
                     live among us!

         MARY LOU'S three adopted children, adults CREDENCE and
         CHASTITY, and MODESTY (an eight-year-old girl), hand out
         leaflets. CREDENCE appears nervous and troubled.

                               MARY LOU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                     We have to fight together for the
                     sake of our children � for the sake
                     of tomorrow!
                          (to NEWT)
                     What do you say to that, friend?

         As NEWT looks up towards MARY LOU, something seen from the
         corner of his eye catches his attention:

         THE NIFFLER, a small furry black cross between a mole and a
         duck-billed platypus, is sitting on the steps of the bank,
         hastily pulling the beggar's hat full of money out of sight
         behind a pillar.

         NEWT, startled, looks down at his case.

         ANGLE ON: the Niffler, busy shovelling the beggar's coins
         into a pouch in its belly. The Niffler looks up, notices
         NEWT'S gaze, and hurriedly gathers the rest of the coins
         before tumbling away and into the bank.


                                                                      (CONTINUED)
 
                                                                              8.
7        CONTINUED: (3)                                                        7
         NEWT jolts forwards.

                                  NEWT
                     Excuse me.

         ANGLE ON: MARY LOU � she looks confused at NEWT'S lack of
         interest in her cause.

                               MARY LOU (O.S.)
                     Witches live among us.

         ANGLE ON: TINA, moving through the crowd, eyeing NEWT
         suspiciously.


8        INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                                  8

         A large, impressive-looking bank atrium. In the centre,
         behind a golden counter, clerks are busy at work serving
         customers.

         NEWT skids to a halt in the entrance of the space and looks
         around for his creature. His dress and demeanour make him out
         of place among the smartly dressed New Yorkers.

                               BANK EMPLOYEE
                          (suspicious)
                     Can I help you, sir?

                                NEWT
                     No, I was just... just...
                     waiting...

         NEWT motions towards a bench and backs away, taking a seat
         next to JACOB.

         TINA peers at NEWT from behind a pillar.

                               JACOB
                          (nervous)
                     Hi. What brings you here?

         NEWT is desperately trying to spot his Niffler.

                               NEWT
                     Same as you...

                               JACOB
                     You're here to get a loan to open
                     up a bakery?




                                                                      (CONTINUED)
 
                                                                              9.
8        CONTINUED:                                                            8
                                  NEWT
                             (looking around �
                             preoccupied)
                      Yes.

                                JACOB
                      What are the odds of that? Well,
                      may the best man win, I guess.

         NEWT spots the Niffler, which is now stealing coins from
         someone's bag.

         JACOB holds out his hand, but NEWT is off.

                                   NEWT
                      Excuse me.

         NEWT darts away. In his place on the bench lies a large
         silver egg.

                                JACOB
                      Hey, mister... hey, mister!

         NEWT doesn't hear; he is too engaged in hunting the Niffler.

         JACOB picks up the egg just as the door into the BANK
         MANAGER'S office opens, and a SECRETARY looks out.

                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                      Hey, fella!

                                SECRETARY
                      Mr Kowalski, Mr Bingley will see
                      you now.

         Pocketing the egg, JACOB heads towards the office, steeling
         himself.

                                JACOB
                           (sotto voce)
                      Okay... okay.

         ANGLE ON: NEWT, surreptitiously pursuing the Niffler as it
         moves through the bank.

         He finally spots it removing a glittering buckle from a
         lady's shoe before scurrying onwards, eager for more shiny
         objects.

         As NEWT watches, helpless, the Niffler jumps lithely between
         cases and into bags, snatching and pilfering.
  
                                                                              10.


9         INT. BINGLEY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                               9

          JACOB is facing the imposing and impeccably suited MR
          BINGLEY. BINGLEY is examining JACOB'S business proposal for a
          bakery.

          An uncomfortable silence. The sound of a ticking clock and
          BINGLEY murmuring. JACOB looks down at his pocket � the egg
          has started to vibrate.

                                BINGLEY
                      You are currently working... in a
                      canning factory?

                                JACOB
                      That's the best I can do � I only
                      got back in '24.

                                  BINGLEY
                      Got back?

                                JACOB
                      From Europe, sir. Yeah � I was part
                      of the Expeditionary Forces there -

          JACOB is clearly nervous, miming a digging action to the
          words 'Expeditionary Forces', in the vain hope that a joke
          might help his cause.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:


10        INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BANK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                      10

          NEWT IN THE BANK: in seeking the Niffler he has ended up
          waiting in line for a bank teller. He cranes his neck,
          peering towards the bag of a lady at the front of the line.
          TINA watches him from behind a pillar.

          ANGLE ON: coins spilling from underneath a bench.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT, who hears the coins and turns to see small
          paws hastily gathering them up.

          ANGLE ON: the Niffler sitting under the bench looking fat and
          smug. Not yet satisfied, its attention is caught by the shiny
          tag hanging around the neck of a small dog. The Niffler moves
          slowly, cheekily, forwards � little paw outstretched to grab
          the tag. The dog snarls and barks.

          NEWT starts forwards and dives under the bench � the Niffler
          runs, scuttling over the bank counter screens and out of
          NEWT'S reach.
  
                                                                              11.


11        INT. BINGLEY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                           11

          JACOB opens his case with great pride. Inside is displayed a
          selection of his home-made pastries.

                                   JACOB (O.S.)
                      All right.

                     BINGLEY
          Mr Kowalski--                                     JACOB (CONT'D)
                                                --you gotta try the paczki,
                                                okay, it's my grandmother's
                                                recipe, the orange zest �
                                                just--
          JACOB holds out a paczki... BINGLEY is not distracted.

                                BINGLEY (CONT'D)
                      --Mr Kowalski, what do you propose
                      to offer the bank as collateral?

                                JACOB
                      Collateral?

                                BINGLEY
                      Collateral.

          JACOB gestures hopefully towards his pastries.

                                BINGLEY (CONT'D)
                      There are machines now that can
                      produce hundreds of doughnuts an
                      hour--

                                JACOB
                      --I know, I know, but they're
                      nothing like what I can do-

                                BINGLEY
                      The bank must be protected, Mr
                      Kowalski. Good day to you.

          BINGLEY dismissively rings a bell on his desk.


12        INT. BEHIND THE BANK COUNTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                   12

          The Niffler sits on a trolley covered in money bags, which it
          greedily empties into its pouch.

          As NEWT watches through the security bars, aghast, a guard
          pushes the trolley away down a corridor.
  
                                                                              12.


13        INT. BANK, HALL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                                 13

          JACOB, downcast, exits BINGLEY'S office. His bulging pocket
          vibrates. Alarmed, he pulls out the egg and looks around.

          ANGLE ON: the Niffler, still sitting on the trolley, which is
          now being pushed into an elevator.

          ANGLE ON: JACOB, who sees NEWT in the distance.

                                JACOB
                      Hey, Mr English guy! I think your
                      egg is hatching.

          NEWT looks hurriedly between JACOB and the shutting elevator
          doors before making a decision: he points his wand at JACOB.
          JACOB and the egg are pulled magically across the bank atrium
          towards NEWT. In a split second, they Disapparate.

          TINA stares, incredulous, from behind a pillar.


14        INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BANK/STAIRCASE - DAY                            14

          NEWT and JACOB Apparate into a narrow stairwell leading to
          the bank's vaults, suddenly past the tellers and security
          guards.

          NEWT gently takes the egg back from JACOB as it hatches,
          revealing a small blue, snake-like bird � an OCCAMY.

          NEWT, his face full of wonder, looks to JACOB as though
          expecting a similar reaction from him.

          Slowly, NEWT carries the baby creature down the stairs.

                                JACOB
                      Excuse me...

          JACOB, very confused, looks back up the stairs towards the
          main bank atrium. On seeing BINGLEY approaching, he ducks
          down the stairs, out of sight.

                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                           (to himself)
                      I was � over there. I was � over
                      there?
  
                                                                              13.


15        INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR OF BANK LEADING TO VAULT - DAY                 15

          JACOB'S POV: NEWT is crouched down, opening his case. He
          carefully places the hatched Occamy inside, whispering
          tenderly:

                                NEWT
                      In you hop...

                                   JACOB (O.S.)
                      Hello?

                                NEWT
                      No. Everyone settle down � stay.
                      Dougal, don't make me come in
                      there...

          JACOB moves along the corridor, staring at NEWT.

          WE SEE a strange green creature, part stick insect, part
          plant, poke its head out of NEWT'S breast pocket, intrigued.

          This is PICKETT, a BOWTRUCKLE.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Don't make me come down there.

          NEWT looks up to see the Niffler squeezing itself through
          locked doors, into the central vault.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Absolutely not!
          NEWT takes out his wand and points it at the vault.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Alohomora.

          WE WATCH the locks and cogs of the vault door turn.

          BINGLEY comes round the corner, just as the vault door starts
          to open.

                                BINGLEY
                           (to JACOB)
                      Oh, so you're gonna STEAL the
                      money, huh?

          BINGLEY hits a button on the wall. An alarm sounds.

          NEWT aims his wand...



                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              14.
15        CONTINUED:                                                           15
                                 NEWT
                       Petrificus Totalus.

          BINGLEY suddenly stiffens and falls back flat on the ground.
          JACOB cannot believe his eyes.

                                 JACOB
                       Mr Bingley!

          The vault door opens wide.

                                 MR BINGLEY
                            (in his paralysed state)
                       ... Kowalski!

          NEWT hurries into the vault.

          Inside he finds the Niffler lying among hundreds of opened
          deposit boxes, and seated on a great pile of cash. The
          Niffler stares at NEWT defiantly as it forces another gold
          bar into its already overflowing pouch.

                                    NEWT
                       Really?!

          NEWT grasps the Niffler tightly and turns it upside down,
          shaking it by its hind legs. An extraordinary, and seemingly
          endless, number of precious items fall out.

                                    NEWT (CONT'D)
                               (to the Niffler)
                       No...
          JACOB looks around him in disbelief, an almost queasy fear.

          Despite their altercation, NEWT is fond of the Niffler. He
          grins as he tickles its stomach, causing more treasure to
          pour out.

          Footsteps on the stairs as several armed guards run down and
          into the vault corridor.

                                 JACOB
                            (panicking)
                       Oh no... no... don't shoot. Don't
                       shoot!

          NEWT quickly seizes JACOB and the two of them, plus the
          Niffler and case, Disapparate.
  
                                                                              15.


16        EXT. DESERTED SIDE STREET NEXT TO THE BANK - DAY                      16

          NEWT and JACOB Apparate into a side street. Security alarms
          ring out from the bank and, at the end of the side street, WE
          SEE crowds gathering, police arriving.

          TINA runs out of the bank and looks down. She sees NEWT
          wrestling the Niffler back into the case, JACOB cowering by a
          wall.

                                  JACOB
                      Ahhh!

                                NEWT
                      For the last time, you pilfering
                      pest � paws off what doesn't belong
                      to you!

          NEWT shuts his case, then looks around at JACOB.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      I'm awfully sorry about all that -

                                JACOB
                      What the hell was that?

                                NEWT
                      Nothing that need concern you. Now
                      unfortunately you have seen far too
                      much, so if you wouldn't mind � if
                      you just stand there � this will be
                      over in a jiffy.
          NEWT, trying to find his wand, turns his back on JACOB.

          JACOB takes the opportunity, seizes his case, and swings it
          violently at NEWT, who is knocked to the ground.

                                  JACOB
                      Sorry-

          JACOB runs for his life.

          NEWT holds his head for a moment and looks after JACOB, who
          has hurried down the alleyway and into the crowd.

                                  NEWT
                      Bugger!

          TINA comes walking down the side street with purpose.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              16.

          NEWT gathers himself, picks up the case and, trying to be
          nonchalant, walks towards her. As he passes her, TINA grabs
          NEWT'S elbow and they Disapparate.


17        EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY OPPOSITE BANK - DAY                              17

          NEWT and TINA Apparate into a cramped, bricked-up alleyway.
          We can still hear police sirens sounding in the background.

          TINA, incredulous and out of breath, rounds on NEWT.

                                 TINA
                       Who are you?

                                    NEWT
                       I'm sorry?

                                 TINA
                       Who are you?

                                 NEWT
                       Newt Scamander. And you are?

                                 TINA
                       What's that thing in your case?

                                 NEWT
                       That's my Niffler.
                            (pointing at hot dog
                            mustard still on TINA'S

                       Why in the name of Deliverance Dane
                       did you let that thing loose?

                                 NEWT
                       I didn't mean to � he's
                       incorrigible, you see, anything
                       shiny, he's all over the place-

                                 TINA
                       You didn't mean to?

                                    NEWT
                       No.

                                 TINA
                       You could not have chosen a worse
                       time to let that creature loose!

                       We're in the middle of a situation
                       here! I'm taking you in.

                                 NEWT
                       You're taking me where?

          She produces her official ID card. It bears her moving
          picture and an impressive symbol of an American eagle:
          MACUSA.

                                 TINA

                            (nervous)
                       So, you work for MACUSA? What are
                       you, some kind of investigator?

                            (hesitates)
                       Uh huh.

          She stuffs her identification card back into her coat.

                                 TINA (CONT'D)
                       Can you please tell me you took
                       care of the No-Maj?

                       You wiped his memory, right? The No-

          She takes NEWT by the arm and they Disapparate again.


18        EXT. BROADWAY - DAY                                                   18

          An ornately carved, incredibly tall skyscraper on the corner
          of a bustling street � the WOOLWORTH BUILDING.

          NEWT and TINA hurry along Broadway towards this building,
          TINA almost dragging NEWT by his coat sleeve.

                                  TINA
                      Come on.

                                NEWT
                      Er � sorry but I do have things to
                      do, actually.

                                TINA
                      Well, you'll have to rearrange
                      them!

          TINA forcefully guides NEWT through the busy traffic.

                                TINA (CONT'D)
                      What are you doing in New York
                      anyway?

                                NEWT
                      I came to buy a birthday present.

                                TINA
                      Couldn't you have done that in
                      London?

          They have arrived outside the Woolworth Building. Workers
          move in and out of a large revolving door.

                                NEWT
                      No, there's only one breeder of
                      Appaloosa Puffskeins in the world
                      and he lives in New York, so no...

          TINA moves NEWT towards a side door, guarded by a man in a
          cloaked uniform.

                                TINA
                           (to the guard)
                      I got a Section 3A.

          The guard immediately opens the door.
  
                                                                              19.


19        INT. WOOLWORTH BUILDING RECEPTION - DAY                               19

          A normal 1920s office atrium, people milling around and
          chatting.

                                TINA (O.S.)
                      Hey. By the way, we closed that guy
                      down a year ago. We don't allow the
                      breeding of magical creatures in
                      New York.

          PAN AROUND to watch TINA come through the door with NEWT. As
          they enter, the whole entrance magically transforms from the
          Woolworth Building to the Magical Congress of the United
          States of America (MACUSA).


20        INT. MACUSA LOBBY - DAY                                               20

          NEWT'S POV: as they move up a wide staircase and enter the
          main lobby � a vast, impressive space with impossibly high
          vaulted ceilings.

          High up, a gigantic dial with many cogs and faces emblazoned
          with the legend: MAGICAL EXPOSURE THREAT LEVEL. The hand on
          the dial points to SEVERE: UNEXPLAINED ACTIVITY. Behind hangs
          an imposing portrait of a majestic-looking witch: SERAPHINA
          PICQUERY, MACUSA's President.

          Owls circulate, witches and wizards in 1920s dress are hard
          at work. TINA guides an impressed-looking NEWT through the
          bustle. They pass several wizards sitting in a line, waiting
          to have their wands shined by a house-elf who operates a
          complex contraption of feathers.

          NEWT and TINA reach an elevator. The doors open to reveal
          RED, a goblin bellboy.

                                RED
                      Hey, Goldstein.

                                  TINA
                      Hey, Red.

          TINA pushes NEWT inside.

                       Major Investigation Department! I
                       got a Section 3A!

          RED uses a long clawed stick to reach an elevator button
          above his head. The elevator descends.


22        INT. MAJOR INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT - DAY                             22

          CLOSE ON: a newspaper � THE NEW YORK GHOST � with the
          headline 'MAGICAL DISTURBANCES RISK WIZARDING EXPOSURE'.

          A group of the highest-level Aurors in the organisation are
          gathered together in serious discussion.

          Among them are GRAVES, examining the newspaper, his face cut
          and bruised from last night's encounter with the strange
          entity, and MADAM PICQUERY herself.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       The International Confederation is
                       threatening to send a delegation.
                       They think this is related to
                       Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.

                                 GRAVES
                       I was there. This is a beast. No
                       human could do what this thing is
                       capable of, Madam President.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY (O.S.)
                       Whatever it is, one thing's clear �
                       it must be stopped. It's
                       terrorising No-Majs, and when No-
                       Majs are afraid, they attack. This
                       could mean exposure. It could mean
                       war.

          On hearing footsteps, the group looks round to see TINA, who
          approaches cautiously, leading NEWT.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D)
                            (angry but contained)
                       I made your position here quite
                       clear, Miss Goldstein.

                                 TINA
                            (frightened)
                       Yes, Madam President, but I--

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       --You are no longer an Auror.

                       TINA
          No, Madam President, but--                    MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D)
                                                --Goldstein.
                                 TINA (CONT'D)
                       There's been a minor incident-

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       Well, this office is currently
                       concerned with very major
                       incidents. Get out.

                                 TINA
                            (humiliated)
                       Yes, ma'am.

          TINA pushes a bemused-looking NEWT back towards the elevator.
          GRAVES looks after them, the only one to appear sympathetic.


23        INT. BASEMENT - DAY                                                   23

          The elevator descends rapidly through the long shaft.

          The doors open onto a cramped, airless, windowless basement
          room. A painful contrast to the floor above. Clearly the
          place where utter no-hopers work.

          TINA leads NEWT past a hundred typewriters clacking away
          unmanned, with a tangle of glass pipes hanging down from the
          ceiling above them.

          As each memo or form is completed by a typewriter, it folds
          itself into an origami rat, which scurries up the appropriate
          tube to the offices above. Two rats collide and fight,
          tearing each other apart.

          TINA walks towards a dingy corner of the room. A sign: WAND
          PERMIT OFFICE.

          NEWT ducks under it.


24        INT. WAND PERMIT OFFICE - DAY                                         24

          The Wand Permit Office is only slightly larger than a
          cupboard. There are piles of unopened wand applications.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              22.
24        CONTINUED:                                                           24
          TINA stops behind a desk, removing her coat and hat. She
          tries to regain her lost status in front of NEWT by appearing
          official, busying herself with papers.

                                 TINA
                       So, you got your wand permit? All
                       foreigners have to have them in New
                       York.

                                 NEWT
                            (lying)
                       I made a postal application weeks
                       ago.

                                 TINA
                            (now sitting   on the desk,
                            scribbles on   a clipboard)
                       Scamander...
                            (finding him   very fishy)
                       And you were just   in Equatorial
                       Guinea?

                                 NEWT
                       I've just completed a year in the
                       field. I'm writing a book about
                       magical creatures.

                                 TINA
                       Like � an extermination guide?

                                 NEWT
                       No. A guide to help people
                       understand why we should be
                       protecting these creatures instead
                       of killing them.

                                 ABERNATHY (O.S.)
                       GOLDSTEIN! Where is she? Where is
                       she? GOLDSTEIN!

          TINA ducks behind her desk, which amuses NEWT.

          ABERNATHY, a pompous jobsworth, enters. He immediately
          realises where TINA is hidden.

                                    ABERNATHY (CONT'D)
                       Goldstein!

          TINA, looking guilty, slowly emerges from behind the desk.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT'D)
                       Did you just butt in on the
                       Investigative Team again?

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          TINA is about to defend herself, but ABERNATHY continues.

                                ABERNATHY (CONT'D)
                      Where've you been?

                                TINA
                           (awkward)
                      What... ?

                                ABERNATHY
                           (to NEWT)
                      Where'd she pick you up?

                                  NEWT
                      Me?

          NEWT quickly looks at TINA, who shakes her head, her
          expression one of desperation. NEWT stalls � a silent pact
          between him and TINA.

                                ABERNATHY
                           (agitated by the lack of
                           information)
                      Have you been tracking them Second
                      Salemers again?

                                TINA
                      Of course not, sir.

          GRAVES comes round the corner. ABERNATHY is immediately
          cowed.
                                ABERNATHY
                      Afternoon, Mr Graves, sir!

                                GRAVES
                      Afternoon, ah � Abernathy.

          TINA steps forwards to formally address GRAVES.

                                TINA
                           (speaking quickly, eager
                           to have her case heard)
                      Mr Graves, sir, this is Mr
                      Scamander � he has a crazy creature
                      in that case and it got out and
                      caused mayhem in a bank, sir.

                                GRAVES
                      Let's see the little guy.

          TINA breathes a sigh of relief: finally someone is listening
          to her.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          NEWT tries to speak up � he looks more panicky than might
          seem warranted by a Niffler � but GRAVES dismisses him.

          TINA theatrically places the case onto a table and throws
          open the lid. She looks aghast at the contents.

          ANGLE ON: the case contents � it is full of pastries.

          NEWT approaches, nervous. On seeing the contents he looks
          horrified. GRAVES looks confused, but smirks slightly:
          another one of TINA'S mistakes.

                                  GRAVES (CONT'D)
                      Tina...

          GRAVES walks away. NEWT and TINA stare at each other.


25        EXT. STREET ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY                              25

          JACOB marches along the overcast street, case in hand, past
          pushcarts, shabby little shops and tenement buildings. He
          continually throws nervous glances over his shoulder.


26        INT. JACOB'S ROOM - DAY                                               26

          A tiny, dirty room, the furnishings sparse and shabby.

          CLOSE ON: the case as JACOB throws it down onto his bed. He
          looks up at a portrait of his grandmother, which hangs on the
          wall.
                                JACOB
                      I'm sorry, Grandma.

          JACOB sits down at his desk, hanging his head in his hands,
          downcast, tired. Behind him, one of the catches on the case
          flies open. JACOB turns...

          He sits down on the bed and examines the case. The second
          catch now flicks open of its own accord, and the case begins
          to shake, emitting aggressive animalistic sounds. JACOB
          slowly backs away.

          Tentatively, he leans forward... suddenly the lid flies open
          and out bursts a MURTLAP � a rat-like creature with an
          anemone-style growth on its back. JACOB grapples with it,
          holding it tightly in both hands as it struggles.

          WE WHIP BACK to the case, which flies open once again as an
          INVISIBLE BEING shoots out, crashing into the ceiling before
          smashing through the window.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              25.

          The Murtlap lunges forwards, biting JACOB on the neck,
          sending him crashing through furniture and tumbling to the
          ground.

          The room shakes heavily, and the wall holding the picture of
          JACOB'S grandma begins to crack before exploding, as more
          creatures escape off-screen.


27        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY - MONTAGE                   27

          A dingy wooden church with darkened windows and a high
          mezzanine balcony. MODESTY is playing a solitary variation of
          hopscotch, skipping in and out of a chalked grid.

                                 MODESTY
                       My momma, your momma,
                       gonna catch a witch

                       My momma, your momma,
                       witches gonna die!

          As she sings we see the church is full of group paraphernalia
          � leaflets advertising MARY LOU'S campaign, and a large
          version of the group's anti- witchcraft banner.


28        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY                             28

          A pigeon coos from a high-up window. CREDENCE steps forwards,
          staring up towards it before mechanically clapping his hands.
          The pigeon flies away.

          WE FOLLOW CHASTITY as she moves through the church and opens
          the large double doors onto the street.


29        EXT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, BACKYARD - DAY                              29

          CHASTITY emerges from the church and rings a large dinner
          bell.


30        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY                             30

          MODESTY continues playing hopscotch. CREDENCE pauses, looking
          past her and out towards the door.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                       take a turn.

          Young children stream into the church.

                                                           TIME CUT:

          Brown soup   is being ladled out to the children, who jostle
          each other   to get near the front of the line. MARY LOU,
          wearing an   apron and looking on approvingly, squeezes through
          the little   crowd.

                                 MARY LOU
                       Collect your leaflets before you
                       get food, children.

          Several of the children turn towards CHASTITY, who waits
          primly, handing out campaign leaflets.

                                                           TIME CUT:

          MARY LOU and CREDENCE ladle out soup, CREDENCE looking
          intently into every face.

          A BOY with a birthmark on his face reaches the front of the
          line. CREDENCE stops his work and stares at him. MARY LOU
          reaches out to touch the BOY'S face.

                                 BOY
                       Is it a witch's mark, ma'am?

                                 MARY LOU
                       No. He's okay.

          The BOY takes his soup and leaves. CREDENCE stares after him,
          as they continue to serve.


31        EXT. MAIN STREET ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE - AFTERNOON                   31

          CLOSE ON: a BILLYWIG � a small blue creature with helicopter-
          like wings on its head � flying high above the street.

          TINA and NEWT walk along the street, TINA carrying the case.

                                 TINA
                            (on the verge of tears)

                       inquiry I'm finished!

                                 NEWT
                       So why would you be finished? I'm
                       the one that's--

                                 TINA
                       --I'm not supposed to go near the
                       Second Salemers!

          The Billywig zooms over their heads. NEWT spins, horrified,
          watching it.

                                 TINA (CONT'D)
                       What was that?

                                 NEWT
                       Er � moth, I think. Big moth.

          TINA finds this explanation dubious.

          They round a corner to find a crowd gathered in front of a
          crumbling building. People are shouting, others are hurriedly
          evacuating the building.

          A POLICEMAN is standing at the centre of the crowd, being
          harassed by disgruntled tenement-dwellers.

                                                           JUMP CUT:

          NEWT and TINA move around the outskirts of the crowd. At the
          back, a tipsy HOBO is trying to attract the POLICEMAN'S
          attention.
                                 POLICEMAN
                       Hey... hey � quiet down � I'm
                       trying to get a statement...

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                       ... I'm telling you it's a gas
                       explosion again, I ain't taking the
                       kids back up there until it's safe.

                                 POLICEMAN
                       Sorry, ma'am � there ain't no smell
                       of gas.

                                 HOBO
                            (drunk)
                       It warn't gas � hey, officer, I
                       seen it! � it wuzza � a gigantic �
                       a huge hippopotto--

          TINA is looking up at the ruined building, and misses NEWT
          sliding his wand from his sleeve and pointing it at the HOBO.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      --gas. It was gas.

          The others in the crowd around him agree.

                                CROWD
                      Gas... it was gas!
          TINA again catches sight of the Billywig. Taking advantage of
          this distraction, NEWT runs up the metal steps and inside the
          ruined tenement building.


32        INT. JACOB'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                         32

          NEWT enters JACOB'S room and stops, staring: the room is
          completely destroyed.

          Footprints, broken furniture, shattered glass. Even worse: a
          massive hole in the opposite wall � something huge has
          blasted its way out.

          We can hear JACOB groaning from the corner.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:


33        EXT. TENEMENT STREET - AFTERNOON                                      33

          TINA as she looks around and realises that NEWT has
          disappeared from the crowd.

34        INT. JACOB'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                         34

          NEWT crouches beside JACOB, who lies on his back, eyes closed
          and moaning. NEWT tries to examine a small red bite on
          JACOB'S neck, but JACOB keeps unconsciously batting him away.

                                TINA (O.S.)
                      Mr Scamander!

                                                           CUT TO:

          TINA: running with purpose up the staircase of JACOB'S
          building.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

          NEWT: who desperately performs a repairing charm. The room is
          righted, the wall repaired, just in time before TINA enters
          the room.
  
                                                                              29.


35        INT. JACOB'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                         35

          TINA hurries inside to find NEWT, trying to look innocent and
          composed, sitting on the bed. He calmly seals the latches on
          his case.

                                TINA
                      It was open?

                                NEWT
                      Just a smidge...

                                TINA
                      That crazy Niffler thing's on the
                      loose again?

                                NEWT
                      Er � it might be -

                                TINA
                      Then look for it! Look!

          JACOB moans.

          TINA drops JACOB'S case and makes straight for the injured
          JACOB.

                                TINA (CONT'D)
                           (worried about JACOB)
                      His neck's bleeding, he's hurt!
                      Wake up, Mr No-Maj...
          With TINA'S back turned, NEWT makes towards the door.
          Suddenly, TINA emits a guttural scream as the Murtlap comes
          scuttling out from under a cabinet and latches onto her arm.

          NEWT spins, catching the creature by the tail and grappling
          it into the case.

                                TINA (CONT'D)
                      Mercy Lewis, what is that?

                                NEWT
                      Nothing to worry about. That is a
                      Murtlap.

          Unnoticed by either, JACOB opens his eyes.

                                TINA
                      What else have you got in there?

                               (recognising NEWT)
                       You!

                                    NEWT
                       Hello.

                                    TINA
                       Easy, Mr--

                                 JACOB
                       --Kowalski... Jacob...

          TINA takes JACOB'S hand to shake it.

          NEWT raises his wand. JACOB recoils in fear, clutching at
          TINA, who moves protectively in front of him.

                                 TINA
                       You can't Obliviate him! We need
                       him as a witness.

                                 NEWT
                       I'm sorry � you've just yelled at
                       me the length of New York for not
                       doing it in the first place...

                                 TINA
                       He's hurt! He looks ill!

                                 NEWT
                       He'll be fine. Murtlap bites aren't
                       serious.

          NEWT puts his wand away.

          JACOB retches into the corner, while TINA looks at NEWT in
          disbelief.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       I admit that is a slightly more
                       severe reaction than I've seen, but
                       if it was really serious � he'd
                       have...

                                    TINA
                       What?

                                 NEWT
                       Well, the first symptom would be
                       flames out of his anus-

          Terrified, JACOB feels the seat of his pants.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      It'll last forty-eight hours at
                      most! I can keep him if you want me
                      to-

                                TINA
                      Oh, keep him? We don't keep them!
                      Mr Scamander, do you know anything
                      about the wizarding community in
                      America?

                                NEWT
                      I do know a few things, actually. I
                      know you have rather backwards laws
                      about relations with non-magic
                      people. That you're not meant to
                      befriend them, that you can't marry
                      them, which seems mildly absurd to
                      me.

          JACOB is following this conversation, open-mouthed.

                                TINA
                      Who's going to marry him? You're
                      both coming with me-

                                NEWT
                      I don't see why I need to come with
                      you-

          TINA tries to lift the partially conscious JACOB from the
          floor.

                                   TINA
                      Help me!

          NEWT feels obliged to help.

                                   JACOB
                      I'm... I'm    dreaming, right? Yeah...
                      I'm tired,    I never went to the
                      bank. This    is all just some big
                      nightmare,    right?

                      For the both of us, Mr Kowalski.

          on the wall. Eventually the photo gives a little shake before
          falling and revealing a hole in the wall, inhabited by the
          Niffler.


36        EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - AFTERNOON                                      36

          A young boy, clutching a huge lollipop, is led down the busy
          street by his father. As they pass a fruit barrow, an apple
          suddenly levitates, bobbing along beside him. The boy gazes
          in wonder as the apple is eaten by something invisible, then
          the smile fades as his lollipop is snatched by the same
          unseen hands.

          AT A NEWSSTAND: the eyes of a lady on an advertisement blink
          open. The outline of a creature becomes visible, camouflage-
          like, before it peels away from the poster. It moves along
          the street, invisible again, only locatable by the lollipop
          it holds � seemingly suspended in mid-air. A dog barks in its
          direction, and the creature scuttles on, knocking over
          newspaper stands, causing bikes and cars to swerve.

          ANGLE ON: the roof of a department store � we see a thin blue
          tail slither inside a small attic window. Suddenly the
          building shakes and tiles break away, as the creature's size
          expands to fill the whole room.


37        INT. SHAW TOWER NEWSROOM - DUSK                                       37

          The glittering Art Deco headquarters of a media empire. Many
          journalists are hard at work in an outer office.

          An elevator opens and LANGDON SHAW bustles excitedly through
          the room, leading the SECOND SALEMERS. He carries maps,
          several old books and a handful of photographs.

          MARY LOU is composed, CHASTITY looks shy and MODESTY is
          excited, curious.

          CREDENCE looks nervous � he doesn't like crowds.

                                LANGDON
                      ... and so this is the newsroom.

          LANGDON spins around excitedly, eager to show the SECOND
          SALEMERS that he holds authority here.

                       Barebones! Now, they're just
                       putting the papers to bed, as they
                       say.

          Looks of veiled amusement from journalists as LANGDON leads
          his group to double doors at the end of the open-plan area.

          HENRY SHAW SR'S assistant � BARKER � stands up, anxious.

                                 BARKER
                       Mr Shaw, sir, he's with the senator-

                                 LANGDON
                       Never mind that, Barker, I wanna
                       see my father!

          LANGDON pushes past.


38        INT. SHAW SR'S PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DUSK                                38

          A large, impressive office with spectacular views across the
          city. The newspaper magnate � HENRY SHAW SR � is talking to
          his elder son, SENATOR SHAW.

                                 SENATOR SHAW
                       ... we could just buy the boats...
          The doors burst open to reveal a harassed-looking BARKER and
          an excitable LANGDON.

                                 BARKER
                       I'm so sorry, Mr Shaw, but your son
                       insisted-

                                  LANGDON
                       Father, you're going to want to
                       hear this.

          LANGDON moves towards his father's desk and begins spreading
          out photographs.

          WE RECOGNISE some of the images: the destroyed streets from
          the start of the film.

                                 LANGDON (CONT'D)
                       I've got something huge!


                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              34.
38        CONTINUED:                                                           38
                                 SHAW SR
                       Your brother and I are busy here,
                       Langdon. Working on his campaign.
                       We don't have time for this.

          MARY LOU, CREDENCE, CHASTITY and MODESTY enter the office.
          SHAW SR and SENATOR SHAW stare.

          CREDENCE stands with his head bowed, embarrassed, nervous.

                                 LANGDON
                       This is Mary Lou Barebone from the
                       New Salem Philanthropic Society,
                       and she's got a big story for you!

                                 SHAW SR
                       Oh she has � has she?

                                 LANGDON
                       There's strange things going on all
                       over the city. The people behind
                       this � they are not like you and
                       me. This is witchcraft, don't you
                       see?

          SHAW SR and the SENATOR look dubious � all too used to
          LANGDON'S harebrained little projects and interests.

                                  SHAW SR
                       Langdon.

                                 LANGDON
                       She doesn't want any money.

                                 SHAW SR
                       Then either her story is worthless,
                       or she's lying about the cost.
                       Nobody gives away anything valuable
                       for free.

                                 MARY LOU
                            (confident, persuasive)
                       You are right, Mr Shaw. What we
                       desire is infinitely more valuable
                       than money: it's your influence.
                       Millions of people read your
                       newspapers and they need to be made
                       aware about this danger.

                                 LANGDON
                       The crazy disturbances in the
                       subway � just look at the pictures!


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                SHAW SR
                      I'd like you and your friends to
                      leave.

                                LANGDON
                      No, you're missing a trick here.
                      Just look at the evidence-

                                  SHAW SR
                      Really.

                                SENATOR SHAW
                           (joining his father and
                           brother)
                      Langdon. Just listen to Father and
                      go.

          His eyes shift, focus on CREDENCE.

                                SENATOR SHAW (CONT'D)
                      And take the freaks with you.

          CREDENCE perceptibly twitches, disturbed by anger in his
          vicinity.

          MARY LOU is calm, but steely.

                                LANGDON
                      This is Father's office, not yours,
                      and I'm sick of this every time I
                      walk in here...
          SHAW SR silences his son and motions for the BAREBONES to
          leave.

                                SHAW SR
                      That's it � thank you.

                                MARY LOU
                           (calm, dignified)
                      We hope you'll reconsider, Mr Shaw.
                      We're not difficult to find. Until
                      then, we thank you for your time.

          SHAW SR and SENATOR SHAW watch MARY LOU as she turns, leading
          her children out. The newsroom has fallen quiet, everyone
          craning to hear the row.

          As he departs, CREDENCE drops a leaflet. SENATOR SHAW moves
          forwards and bends to pick it up. He glances at the witches
          on the front.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           (to CREDENCE)
                      Hey, boy. You dropped something.

          The SENATOR crumples up the leaflet before putting it in
          CREDENCE'S hand.

                                SENATOR SHAW (CONT'D)
                      Here you go, freak � why don't you
                      put that in the trash where you all
                      belong.

          Behind CREDENCE, MODESTY'S eyes burn. She clutches CREDENCE'S
          hand protectively.


39        EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS - DUSK                    39

          TINA and NEWT stand on either side of an ailing JACOB, trying
          to keep him steady.

                                TINA
                      Take a right here...

          JACOB makes various retching sounds, the bite on his neck
          clearly affecting him more and more.

          As the group rounds a corner, TINA hurries them to hide
          behind a large repair truck. From here she peers at a house
          across the street.

                                TINA (CONT'D)
                      Okay � before we go in � I'm not
                      supposed to have men on the
                      premises.

                                NEWT
                      In that case, Mr Kowalski and I can
                      easily seek other accommodation-

                                TINA
                      Oh no, you don't!

          TINA quickly grabs JACOB'S arm and pulls him across the road,
          NEWT dutifully following.

                                TINA (CONT'D)
                      Watch your step.


40        INT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE, STAIRWELL - DUSK                            40

          NEWT, TINA and JACOB tiptoe up the stairs.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          They have just reached the first landing when MRS ESPOSITO,
          the landlady, calls out. The group freezes.

                                 MRS ESPOSITO (O.S.)
                       That you, Tina?

                                 TINA
                       Yes, Mrs Esposito!

                                 MRS ESPOSITO (O.S.)
                       Are you alone?

                                 TINA
                       I'm always alone, Mrs Esposito!

          A beat.


41        INT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE, SITTING ROOM - DUSK                         41

          The group enters the Goldstein apartment.

          Although impoverished, the apartment is enlivened by workaday
          magic. An iron is working away on its own in a corner, and a
          clothes horse revolves clumsily on its wooden legs in front
          of the fire, drying an assortment of underwear.

          Magazines are scattered around: THE WITCH'S FRIEND, WITCH
          CHAT and TRANSFIGURATION TODAY.

          Blonde QUEENIE, the most beautiful girl ever to don witches'
          robes, is standing in a silk slip, supervising the mending of
          a dress on a dressmaker's dummy.

          JACOB is thunderstruck.

          NEWT barely notices. Impatient to leave as soon as possible,
          he starts peeking out of the windows.

                                 QUEENIE
                       Teenie � you brought men home?

                                 TINA
                       Gentlemen, this is my sister. You
                       want to put something on, Queenie?

                                 QUEENIE
                            (unconcerned)
                       Oh, sure-

          She runs her wand up the dummy and the dress runs magically
          up her body.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              38.

          JACOB watches the display, dumbfounded.

          TINA, frustrated, starts tidying the apartment.

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                       So, who are they?
                                 TINA
                       That's Mr Scamander. He's committed
                       a serious infraction of the
                       National Statute of Secrecy-

                                 QUEENIE
                            (impressed)
                       He's a criminal?

                                 TINA
                       -uh huh, and this is Mr Kowalski,
                       he's a No-Maj-

                                 QUEENIE
                            (suddenly worried)
                       A No-Maj? Teen � what are you up
                       to?

                                 TINA
                       He's sick � it's a long story � Mr
                       Scamander has lost something, I'm
                       going to help him find it.

          JACOB suddenly staggers, very sweaty and unwell.
          QUEENIE runs to him as TINA hovers, also worried.

                                 QUEENIE
                            (as JACOB falls back onto
                            a sofa)
                       You need to sit down, honey. Hey-
                            (reading his mind)
                       -he hasn't eaten all day. And-
                            (reading his mind)
                       -aww, that's rough,
                            (reading his mind)
                       -he didn't get the money he wanted
                       for his bakery. You bake, honey? I
                       love to cook.

          NEWT is watching QUEENIE from his spot by the window, his
          scientific attention now aroused.

                                 NEWT

                      the accent.

                                JACOB
                           (cottoning on, appalled)
                      You know how to read minds?

                                QUEENIE
                      Aww, don't worry, honey. Most guys
                      think what you was thinking, first
                      time they see me.

          QUEENIE playfully gestures towards JACOB with her wand.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                      Now, you need food.

          NEWT looks out the window and sees a Billywig fly past � he's
          nervous, impatient to get out and find his creatures.

          TINA and QUEENIE busy themselves in the kitchen. Ingredients
          come floating out of cupboards as QUEENIE enchants them into
          the components of a meal � carrots and apples chop
          themselves, pastry rolls itself and pans stir.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                           (to TINA)
                      Hot dog... again?

                                TINA
                      Don't read my mind!

                                QUEENIE
                      Not a very wholesome lunch.

          TINA points her wand at the cupboards. Dishes, assorted
          cutlery and glasses come flying out, setting themselves on
          the table with a little prodding from TINA'S wand.

          JACOB, half-fascinated, half-terrified, staggers towards the
          table.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT, his hand on the doorknob.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                           (artless)
                      Hey, Mr Scamander, you prefer pie
                      or strudel?

          All look at NEWT who, embarrassed, removes his hand from the
          doorknob.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              40.
41        CONTINUED: (3)                                                       41
                                NEWT
                      I really don't have a preference.

          TINA stares at NEWT: confrontational, but also disappointed
          and hurt.

          JACOB is already seated at the table, tucking his napkin into
          his shirt.

                                QUEENIE
                           (reading JACOB'S mind)
                      You prefer strudel, huh, honey?
                      Strudel it is.

          JACOB nods with excited enthusiasm. QUEENIE grins back,
          delighted.

          With a flick of her wand, QUEENIE sends raisins, apples and
          pastry flying into the air. The concoction neatly wraps
          itself up into a cylindrical pie, baking on the spot,
          complete with ornate decoration and a dusting of sugar.

          JACOB takes a deep breath in: heaven.

          TINA lights candles on the table � the meal is ready.

          FOCUS ON: NEWT'S pocket, a small squeak, and PICKETT pokes
          his head out, curious.

                                TINA
                      Well, sit down, Mr Scamander, we're
                      not going to poison you.

          NEWT, still hovering near the door, looks somewhat charmed by
          the situation. JACOB glares at him subtly, willing him to sit
          down.


42        EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT                                                 42

          CREDENCE is walking alone through a worldly crowd of late-
          night diners and theatre-goers. Traffic roars past. He is
          trying to give out leaflets but is met with only incredulity
          and faint derision.

          The Woolworth Building looms ahead. CREDENCE glances towards
          it with a hint of longing. GRAVES stands outside, watching
          CREDENCE intently. CREDENCE spots him, hope flickering across
          his face. Utterly enthralled, CREDENCE moves across the
          street towards GRAVES, barely looking where he's going �
          everything else is forgotten.
  
                                                                              41.


43        EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT                                                 43

          CREDENCE stands, head bowed, at the end of a dimly lit
          alleyway. GRAVES joins him, moving in very close to whisper,
          conspiratorial:

                                GRAVES
                      You're upset. It's your mother
                      again. Somebody's said something �
                      what did they say? Tell me.

                                CREDENCE
                      Do you think I'm a freak?

                                GRAVES
                      No � I think you're a very special
                      young man or I wouldn't have asked
                      you to help me, now would I?

          A pause. GRAVES rests a hand on CREDENCE'S arm. The human
          contact seems to both startle and captivate CREDENCE.

                                GRAVES (CONT'D)
                      Have you any news?

                                CREDENCE
                      I'm still looking. Mr Graves, if I
                      knew whether it was a girl or boy-

                                GRAVES
                      My vision showed only the child's
                      immense power. He or she is no
                      older than ten, and I saw this
                      child in close proximity to your
                      mother � she I saw so plainly.

                                CREDENCE
                      That could be any one of hundreds.

          GRAVES'S tone softens � he's beguiling, comforting.

                                GRAVES
                      There is something else. Something
                      I haven't told you. I saw you
                      beside me in New York. You're the
                      one that gains this child's trust.
                      You are the key � I saw this. You
                      want to join the wizarding world. I
                      want those things too, Credence. I
                      want them for you. So find the
                      child. Find the child and we'll all
                      be free.
  
                                                                              42.


44        INT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE, SITTING ROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER -
                                                                    44
          NIGHT

          The catch on NEWT'S case pops open. NEWT reaches down and
          pushes it shut.

          JACOB looks a little better for having eaten. He and QUEENIE
          are getting on famously.

                                QUEENIE
                      The job ain't that glamorous. I
                      mean, I spend most days making
                      coffee, unjinxing the john...
                      Tina's the career girl.
                           (she reads his mind)
                      Nah. We're orphans. Ma and Pa died
                      of dragon pox when we were kids.
                      Aww...
                           (reading his mind)
                      You're sweet. But we got each
                      other!

                                JACOB
                      Could you stop reading my mind for
                      a second? Don't get me wrong � I
                      love it.

          QUEENIE giggles, delighted, captivated by JACOB.

                                  JACOB (CONT'D)
                      This   meal � it's insanely good!
                      This   is what I do � I'm a cook and
                      this   is, like, the greatest meal I
                      have   ever had in my life.

                                QUEENIE
                           (laughing)
                      Oh you slay me! I ain't never
                      really talked to a No-Maj before.

                                  JACOB
                      Really?

          QUEENIE and JACOB gaze into each other's eyes.

          NEWT and TINA sit opposite each other, uncomfortably silent
          in the presence of such affectionate behaviour.

                                QUEENIE
                           (to TINA)
                      I am not flirting!



                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              43.
44        CONTINUED:                                                           44
                                 TINA
                            (embarrassed)
                       I'm just saying � don't go getting
                       attached, he's going to have to be
                       Obliviated!
                            (to JACOB)
                       It's nothing personal.

          JACOB is suddenly very pale and sweaty again, although still
          trying to look good for QUEENIE.

                                 QUEENIE
                            (to JACOB)
                       Oh, hey, you okay, honey?

          NEWT briskly gets up from the table and awkwardly stands
          behind his chair.

                                 NEWT
                       Miss Goldstein, I think Mr Kowalski
                       could do with an early night. And
                       besides, you and I will need to be
                       up early tomorrow morning to find
                       my Niffler, so--

                                 QUEENIE
                            (to TINA)
                       What's a Niffler?

          TINA looks put out.

                                  TINA
                       Don't ask.
                            (moving towards a back
                            room)
                       Okay, you guys can bunk in here.


45        INT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE, BEDROOM - NIGHT                             45

          The boys are tucked up in neatly made twin beds. NEWT is
          resolutely turned away on his side, while JACOB is sitting up
          in bed, trying to make sense of a wizarding book.

          TINA, wearing patterned blue pyjamas, tentatively knocks on
          the door, and enters carrying a tray of cocoa. The mugs are
          stirring themselves � JACOB is captivated again.

                                 TINA
                       I thought you might like a hot
                       drink?

          TINA carefully hands JACOB his mug.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              44.
45        CONTINUED:                                                           45
          NEWT remains turned away, feigning sleep, so TINA, with some
          frustration, pointedly places his cup on the bedside table.

                                 JACOB
                       Hey, Mr Scamander--
                            (to NEWT, trying to make
                            him friendlier)
                       Look, cocoa!

          NEWT does not move.

                                 TINA
                            (irritated)
                       The toilet's down the hall to the
                       right.

                                   JACOB
                       Thanks...

          As TINA shuts the door, JACOB gets a quick glimpse of QUEENIE
          in the other room, wearing a much less demure dressing gown.

                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                       Very much...

          The moment the door closes NEWT jumps up, still wearing his
          overcoat, and places his case on the floor. To JACOB'S utter
          astonishment, NEWT opens the case and walks down inside it,
          now completely out of sight.

          JACOB lets out a small scream of alarm.
          NEWT'S hand appears from the case, beckoning him imperiously.
          JACOB stares, breathing heavily, trying to process the
          situation.

          NEWT'S hand, impatient, appears again.

                                   NEWT (O.S.)
                       Come on.

          JACOB rallies himself, gets out of bed and steps down into
          NEWT'S case. However, he gets stuck at his waistline and
          tries hard to squeeze himself through, the case bouncing up
          and down with his efforts.

                                 JACOB
                       For the love of...

          With a final frustrated jump, JACOB suddenly disappears
          through the case, which snaps shut after him.
  
                                                                              45.


46        INT. NEWT'S CASE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT                             46

          JACOB crashes down the steps of the case, colliding with
          various objects, instruments and bottles as he goes.

          He finds himself inside a small wooden shed containing a camp
          bed, tropical gear and various tools hung up on the walls.
          Wooden cupboards contain rope, nets and collecting jars. A
          very old typewriter, a pile of manuscripts and a medieval
          bestiary sit on a desk. Potted plants line a shelf. Rows of
          pills and tablets, syringes and vials form a medicine chest,
          and tacked up on the walls are notes, maps, drawings and a
          few moving photographs of extraordinary creatures. A dried
          carcass hangs from a hook. Several sacks of feed are resting
          against the wall.

                                NEWT
                           (glances at JACOB)
                      Will you sit down.

          JACOB drops onto a crate hand-labelled MOONCALF PELLETS.

                                JACOB
                      That's good.

          NEWT moves forward to examine the bite on JACOB'S neck � one
          quick glance.

                                 NEWT
                      Ah, that's definitely the Murtlap.
                      You must be particularly
                      susceptible. See, you're a Muggle.
                      So our physiologies are subtly
                      different.

          NEWT busies himself at his work station, using plants and the
          contents of various bottles to create a poultice, which he
          rapidly applies to JACOB'S neck.

                                  JACOB
                      Oww...

                                NEWT
                      Now stay still. Now that should
                      stop the sweating.
                           (handing him some pills)
                      And one of those should sort the
                      twitch.

          JACOB looks suspiciously at the pills in his hand. Finally,
          deciding he has nothing to lose, he swallows them.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              46.
46        CONTINUED:                                                           46
          ANGLE ON: NEWT, who has now removed his waistcoat, undone his
          bow tie and lowered his braces. He picks up a meat cleaver
          and hacks chunks of meat off a large carcass, before tossing
          them into a bucket.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (handing him the bucket)
                       Take that.

          JACOB looks disgusted. NEWT doesn't notice, his attention now
          focused on a spiny cocoon, which he slowly begins to squeeze.
          As he does so, the cocoon emits a luminous venom, which NEWT
          collects into a glass vial.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (to the cocoon)
                       Come on...

                                 JACOB
                       What you got there?

                                 NEWT
                       Well this � the locals call
                       'Swooping Evil' � not the
                       friendliest of names. It's quite an
                       agile fellow.

          As if to demonstrate, NEWT flicks the cocoon, which unravels,
          dangling elegantly from his finger.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       I've been studying him. And I am
                       pretty sure his venom could be
                       quite useful if properly diluted.
                       Just to remove bad memories, you
                       know.

          Quite suddenly NEWT throws the Swooping Evil towards JACOB.
          The creature bursts out from its cocoon � a bat-like, spikey
          and colourful creature � which howls in JACOB'S face before
          NEWT recalls it. JACOB recoils dramatically, but this was
          evidently NEWT'S idea of a little joke...

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (smiling to himself)
                       Probably shouldn't let him loose in
                       here, though.

          NEWT opens the door of his shed and walks through.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Come on.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          JACOB, now thoroughly startled, follows him out.


47        INT. NEWT'S CASE, ANIMAL AREA - DAY                                   47

          The perimeter of the leather case is dimly visible, but the
          place has swollen to the size of a small aircraft hangar. It
          contains what appears to be a safari park in miniature. Each
          of NEWT'S creatures has its own perfect, magically realised,
          habitat.

          JACOB steps into this world, totally amazed.

          NEWT is standing in the nearest habitat � a slice of Arizona
          desert. This area contains FRANK, a magnificent Thunderbird �
          a creature like a large albatross, his glorious wings
          shimmering with cloud- and sun-like patterns. One of his legs
          is rubbed raw and bloody � he has obviously previously been
          chained.

          As FRANK flaps his wings, his habitat fills with a torrential
          downpour, thunder and lightning. NEWT uses his wand to create
          a magical umbrella, shielding him from the rain.

                                NEWT
                           (eyes on FRANK up high)
                      Come on.... come on... down you
                      come... come on.

          Slowly FRANK calms himself, lowering down to stand on a large
          rock in front of NEWT. As he does, the rain dies down and is
          replaced by a brilliant, hot sunshine.

          NEWT puts his wand away and produces a handful of grubs from
          his pocket. FRANK watches intently.

          NEWT strokes FRANK with his free hand, calming him,
          affectionate.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Oh, thank Paracelsus. If you'd have
                      got out that could have been quite
                      catastrophic.
                            (to JACOB)
                      You see, he's the real reason I
                      came to America. To bring Frank
                      home.

          JACOB, still staring, steps slowly forwards. In reaction,
          FRANK starts to flap his wings, agitated.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              48.
47        CONTINUED:                                                           47
                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (to JACOB)
                       No, sorry � stay there � he's a wee
                       bit sensitive to strangers.
                            (to FRANK, calming)
                       Here you are � here you are.
                            (to JACOB)
                       He was trafficked, you see. I found
                       him in Egypt, he was all chained
                       up.

          Couldn't leave him there, had to bring him back. I'm going to
          put you back where you belong, aren't I, Frank. To the wilds
          of Arizona.

          NEWT, his face full of hope and expectation, hugs FRANK'S
          head. Then, grinning, he casts the handful of grubs high into
          the air. FRANK soars majestically upwards after them,
          sunlight bursting from his wings.

          NEWT watches him fly with love and pride. Then he turns, puts
          his hands to his mouth, and roars beast-like towards another
          area of the case.

          NEWT moves past JACOB, grabbing the bucket of meat. JACOB
          stumbles after him as several Doxys buzz around his head.
          JACOB, dazed, swats them out of the way. Behind him a large
          dung beetle rolls a giant ball of dung.

          We hear NEWT roar loudly again. JACOB hurries towards the
          sound, finding NEWT in a sandy, moonlit territory.
                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (under his breath)
                       Ah � here they come.

                                 JACOB
                       Here who comes?

                                 NEWT
                       The Graphorns.

          A large creature comes charging INTO SIGHT: a GRAPHORN �
          built like a sabre- toothed tiger but with slimy tentacles at
          its mouth. JACOB screams and tries to back off, but NEWT
          grabs hold of his arm, stopping him.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       You're all right. You're all right.

          The Graphorn moves closer to NEWT.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

47        CONTINUED: (2)                                                       47
                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (stroking the Graphorn)
                      Hello, hello!

          The Graphorn's strange slimy tentacles rest on NEWT'S
          shoulder, seeming to embrace him.
                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      So they're the last breeding pair
                      in existence. If I hadn't managed
                      to rescue them, that could have
                      been the end of Graphorns � for
                      ever.

          A younger Graphorn trots straight up to JACOB and begins
          licking his hand, circling him curiously. He stares down at
          it, then gently reaches out and strokes its head. NEWT
          watches JACOB, pleased.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                      All right.

          NEWT throws a piece of meat into the enclosure, which is
          hastily chased and consumed by the young Graphorn.

                                 JACOB
                      So what � you, you rescue these
                      creatures?

                                NEWT
                      Yes, that's right. Rescue, nurture
                      and protect them, and I'm gently
                      trying to educate my fellow wizards
                      about them.

          A tiny bright pink bird, the FWOOPER, flies past and comes to
          rest on a little perch, suspended from mid-air.

          NEWT heads up a small ramp of stairs.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (to JACOB)
                      Come on.

          They enter a bamboo wood, ducking and diving through the
          trees. NEWT calls out.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

          They emerge into a sunlit glade, NEWT producing PICKETT from
          his pocket and holding him perched on his hand.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           (to JACOB)
                      He had a cold. He needed some body
                      warmth.

                                  JACOB
                      Aww.
          They move towards a small tree bathed in sunlight. At their
          approach, a clan of Bowtruckles chatters and rushes out of
          the leaves.

          NEWT extends his arm towards the tree, trying to persuade
          PICKETT to rejoin the others. The Bowtruckles clack noisily
          when they see PICKETT.

                                NEWT
                      Right, on you hop.

          PICKETT steadfastly refuses to leave NEWT'S arm.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (to JACOB)
                      See, he has some attachment issues.
                           (to PICKETT)
                      Now come on, Pickett. Pickett. No,
                      they're not going to bully you...
                      now, come on. Pickett!

          PICKETT clings by his spindly hands to one of NEWT'S fingers,
          desperate not to return to the tree. NEWT finally resigns
          himself.
                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      All right. But that is exactly why
                      they accuse me of favouritism...

          NEWT puts PICKETT onto his shoulder and turns. On seeing a
          large, round, empty nest, he looks concerned.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      I wonder where Dougal's gone.

          From within a nearby nest, we hear chirping sounds.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      All right, I'm coming... I'm
                      coming, Mum's here � Mum's here.

          NEWT reaches into the nest and scoops up a baby Occamy.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      Yes � do you want to...

          NEWT proffers the Occamy to JACOB.

                                JACOB
                      Oh wow... yeah, sure. Okay... ah
                      ha.

          JACOB holds the newborn creature gently in his hands and
          stares. As he moves to stroke its head, the Occamy moves to
          nip him. JACOB starts backwards.

                                NEWT
                      Ah, no, sorry � don't pet them.
                      They learn to defend themselves
                      early. See, their shells are made
                      of silver so they're incredibly
                      valuable.

          NEWT feeds the other babies in the nest.

                                  JACOB
                      Okay...

                                NEWT
                      Their nests tend to get ransacked
                      by hunters.

          NEWT, delighted by JACOB'S interest in his creatures, takes
          back the baby Occamy, placing it in the nest.

                                 JACOB
                      Thank you.

                                NEWT
                      Call me Newt.

                                JACOB
                      Newt... I don't think I'm dreaming.

                                NEWT
                           (vaguely amused)
                      What gave it away?

                                JACOB
                      I ain't got the brains to make this
                      up.

          NEWT looks at JACOB, both intrigued and flattered.

                                NEWT
                      Actually, would you mind throwing
                      some of those pellets in with the
                      Mooncalves over there?

                                JACOB
                      Yeah, sure.

          JACOB bends down and picks up the bucket of pellets.

                                NEWT
                      Just over there...

          NEWT grabs a nearby wheelbarrow and sets off further into the
          case.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (annoyed)
                      Bugger � the Niffler's gone. Of
                      course he has, little bugger. Any
                      chance to get his hands on
                      something shiny.

          As JACOB walks through the case, we see what appear to be
          golden 'leaves' falling from a tiny tree, which move together
          EN MASSE TOWARDS THE CAMERA. They swarm upwards, mingling
          with Doxys, Glow Bugs and Grindylows which float through the
          air.

          THE CAMERA PANS UP to reveal another magnificent creature,
          the NUNDU � looking almost exactly like a lion, it has a
          large mane which bursts forth when it roars. It stands
          proudly on a large rock, roaring at the moon. NEWT scatters
          food at its feet and purposefully moves on.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          A DIRICAWL � a small, plump bird � waddles in the foreground
          followed by its constantly Apparating chicks, as JACOB climbs
          up a steep grassy bank.

                                JACOB
                           (to himself)
                      What did you do today, Jacob? I was
                      inside a suitcase.

          At the top, JACOB finds a large moonlit rock face populated
          by little Mooncalves � shy, with huge eyes filling their
          whole faces.

                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                      Hey! Oh, hello fellas � all right �
                      all right.

          The Mooncalves jump and hop down the rocks towards JACOB, who
          finds himself suddenly surrounded by their friendly, hopeful
          faces.

                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                      Take it easy � take it easy.

          As he throws pellets, the Mooncalves bob eagerly up and down.
          JACOB visibly seems to be feeling better � he really likes
          this...

          ANGLE ON: NEWT, now cradling a luminescent creature with
          sprouting alien-like tendrils. He feeds the creature with a
          bottle, while carefully watching how JACOB handles the
          Mooncalves � he recognises a kindred spirit.
                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                           (still feeding the
                           Mooncalves)
                      There you go, cutie. Ah, there it
                      is.

          A kind of icy cry echoes from nearby.

                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                           (towards NEWT)
                      Did you hear that?

          But NEWT is gone. JACOB turns to see a curtain billowing
          open, behind which is revealed a snowscape.

          WE PUSH INWARDS, towards a small oleaginous black mass
          suspended in mid-air � an OBSCURUS. JACOB, intrigued, moves
          into the snowscape to get a closer look. The mass continues
          to swirl, emitting a disturbed, restless energy. JACOB
          reaches out to touch it.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      Step back.

          JACOB jumps.

                                  JACOB
                      Jeez...

                                NEWT
                      Step back...

                                JACOB
                      What's the matter with this?

                                NEWT
                      I said step away.

                                JACOB
                      What the hell is this thing?

                                NEWT
                      It's an Obscurus.

          JACOB looks at NEWT, who is momentarily lost in a bad
          reverie. NEWT turns abruptly away and heads back towards the
          hut, his tone colder, more efficient, no longer happy to play
          about in the case.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      I need to get going, find everyone
                      who's escaped before they get hurt.
          The pair enters another forest, NEWT ploughing ahead, on a
          mission.

                                JACOB
                      Before they could get hurt?

                                NEWT
                      Yes, Mr Kowalski. See, they're
                      currently in alien terrain,
                      surrounded by millions of the most
                      vicious creatures on the planet.

                      Humans.

          NEWT stops once more, staring into a large savannah
          enclosure, which is empty of any beasts.

          JACOB shrugs as he tries to think of somewhere.

                      you, but, don't you think it's kind
                      of a double cross? The girls take
                      us in � they make us hot cocoa...

                      You do realise that when they see
                      you've stopped sweating, they'll

          CREDENCE walks home towards the church. He looks happier than
          before: his meeting with GRAVES has comforted him.

          CREDENCE slowly enters the church, shutting the double doors
          quietly.

          CHASTITY is in the kitchen area, drying crockery.

          MARY LOU sits in semi-darkness on the stairs. CREDENCE senses
          her and pauses, his face one of trepidation.

                                MARY LOU

                      I'm sorry, Ma. I didn't realise it
                      was so late.

          As if on autopilot, CREDENCE removes his belt. MARY LOU
          stands and extends her hand, taking the belt. In silence, she
          turns and walks up the stairs, CREDENCE obediently following.

          MODESTY moves to the bottom of the stairs, watching them go,
          a look of fear and upset on her face.

          A LARGE FROZEN POND in the middle of Central Park. Children
          ice-skate. A boy takes a tumble. A girl comes to help him up,
          they link hands.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          As they are about to stand, a light becomes visible
          underneath the ice. A deep rumbling sound echoes. The
          children stare as a glowing beast glides under the ice
          beneath them, and off into the distance.

          NEWT and JACOB walk along another deserted street on the way
          to Central Park.

          The shops around them are full of expensive jewellery,
          diamonds, precious stones.

          NEWT, carrying his case, scans the shadows for small

                       Ah.

          NEWT seems thoroughly intrigued by JACOB.

                                 NEWT
                       Why did you decide to be a baker?

                                 JACOB
                       Ah, well, um � because I'm dying �
                       in that canning factory.
                            (off NEWT'S look)
                       Everyone there's dying. It just
                       crushes the life outta you. You
                       like canned food?


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                  NEWT
                       No.

                                 JACOB
                       Me neither. That's why I want to
                       make pastries, you know. It makes
                       people happy. We're going this way.

          JACOB heads off to his right. NEWT follows.

                                 NEWT
                       So did you get your loan?

                                 JACOB
                       Er, no � I ain't got no collateral.
                       Stayed in the army too long,
                       apparently � I don't know.

                                 NEWT
                       What, you fought in the war?

                                 JACOB
                       Of course I fought in the war,
                       everyone fought in the war � you
                       didn't fight in the war?

                                 NEWT
                       I worked mostly with dragons,
                       Ukrainian Ironbellies � Eastern
                       Front.

          NEWT suddenly stops. He has noticed a small shiny earring
          lying on top of a car bonnet. His eyes move downwards:

          DIAMONDS ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE PAVEMENT, leading towards
          the window of one particular diamond shop.

          NEWT stealthily follows the trail, creeping past shop
          windows. Something catches his eye and suddenly he pauses.
          Very slowly, he tiptoes backwards.

          The Niffler is standing in a shop window. In order to hide,
          it is emulating a jewellery stand, little arms outstretched,
          covered in diamonds.

          NEWT stares at the Niffler in disbelief. Sensing NEWT'S
          stare, the Niffler slowly turns. The two of them make eye
          contact.

          A beat.

          Suddenly the Niffler is off: scurrying further into the shop
          and away from NEWT. NEWT whips out his wand.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              59.
50        CONTINUED: (2)                                                       50

                      Finestra.

          The window glass shatters and NEWT leaps inside, seizing at
          drawers and cupboards, desperate to find the creature. JACOB
          stares down the street, incredulous as he watches NEWT who,
          from an outsider's perspective, appears to be looting the
          diamond shop.

          The Niffler appears, scurrying over NEWT'S shoulders in an
          attempt to get higher and away from his clutches. NEWT jumps
          onto a desk after him, but the Niffler is now balancing on a
          crystal chandelier.

          NEWT reaches out and trips, both he and the Niffler now
          hanging from the chandelier as it swings wildly round and
          round.

          JACOB looks around the street nervously, checking if anyone
          else can hear the chaos coming from within the shop.

          Finally the chandelier crashes to the floor, smashing.
          Straight away the Niffler is back up, clambering across cases
          full of jewellery, NEWT in hot pursuit.

          A catch opens on NEWT'S case and a roar comes from within.
          JACOB fearfully looks towards the case.

          The Niffler and NEWT continue their chase, finally climbing
          onto a jewellery case that can't take their weight. The case,
          with them both on top, falls to rest against one of the shop
          windows. Both NEWT and the Niffler become very still...
          JACOB breathes deeply and slowly moves forward to close the
          latch on the case.

          Suddenly a crack appears on the window. NEWT watches as the
          crack spreads across the pane of glass and the window bursts
          open, shattering across the pavement � NEWT and the Niffler
          crashing to the ground.

          The Niffler is still only for a moment before running off
          down the street. NEWT quickly gathers himself, drawing his
          wand.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                      ACCIO!

          IN SLOW MOTION: the Niffler sails backwards through the air
          towards NEWT. As he flies, he looks sideways at the most
          glorious window display yet. His eyes widen. Jewellery falls
          from his pouch as he flies towards NEWT and JACOB, who duck
          and dive as they run forwards towards the creature.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              60.

          Passing a lamp-post, the Niffler stretches out an arm,
          spinning around the pole and flying onwards, out of the
          trajectory NEWT had him on, and towards the glorious window.
          NEWT casts a spell towards the window, turning it into a
          sticky jelly, which finally traps the Niffler.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (to the Niffler)
                      All right? Happy?

          NEWT, now covered in jewellery, pulls the Niffler from the
          window.

          We hear POLICE SIRENS in the background.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      One down, two to go.

          Police cars come racing through the streets.

          NEWT once again sets about shaking all the diamonds from the
          Niffler's pouch.

          The police cars pull up, and POLICEMEN run out, guns aimed at
          NEWT and JACOB.

          JACOB, also covered in jewels, holds up his hands in
          surrender.

                                JACOB
                      They went that way, officer...
                                  POLICE OFFICER 1
                      Hands up!

          The Niffler, stuffed into NEWT'S overcoat, pokes out its
          little nose and squeaks.

                                POLICE OFFICER 2
                      What the hell is THAT?

          JACOB suddenly looks to the left, his face one of terror.

                                JACOB
                           (barely able to speak)
                      Lion...

          A beat, then IN UNISON: the police turn both their eyes and
          their guns towards the other end of the street.

          Perplexed, NEWT looks too... a lion is stalking towards them.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      You know, New York is considerably
                      more interesting than I'd expected.

          Before the police can look back, NEWT grabs JACOB and they
          Disapparate.


51        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT                                             51

          NEWT and JACOB hurry through the frost-covered park.

          As they cross a bridge, they are almost bowled over by an
          ostrich, which tears past them, running for its life.

          A loud rumble can be heard in the distance.

          NEWT tugs protective headgear out of his pocket, and hands it
          to JACOB.

                                NEWT
                      Put this on.

                                JACOB
                      Why � why would I have to wear
                      something like this?

                                NEWT
                      Because your skull is susceptible
                      to breakage under immense force.

          NEWT runs on. Utterly terrified, JACOB puts on the hat and
          chases after NEWT.


52        EXT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE - NIGHT                                      52

          TINA and QUEENIE lean out of their bedroom window, craning
          into the dark.

          Another bellowing roar reverberates through the winter night.
          Other windows open, neighbours stare sleepily over the city.


53        INT. GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE - NIGHT                                      53

          TINA and QUEENIE burst into the bedroom where JACOB and NEWT
          are meant to be asleep.

          Every trace of the two men has gone. Furious, TINA storms off
          to dress. QUEENIE looks upset.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

54        EXT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - NIGHT                                         54

          NEWT and JACOB run up to the now half-empty zoo, the outer
          walls of which have been demolished in places. A large pile
          of rubble lies at the entrance.

          Another bellowing roar echoes around the brick building. NEWT
          produces a body protector.

                                 NEWT
                       Okay, if you just, uh, pop this on.

          NEWT stands behind JACOB, fastening the breastplate over him.

                                  JACOB
                       Okay.

                                 NEWT
                       Now there's absolutely nothing for
                       you to worry about.

                                 JACOB
                       Tell me � has anyone ever believed
                       you when you told them not to
                       worry?

                                 NEWT
                       My philosophy is that worrying
                       means you suffer twice.

          JACOB digests NEWT'S 'wisdom'.

          NEWT picks up his case and JACOB follows him, stumbling over
          rubble and debris.

          They stand at the entrance to the zoo. A loud snort comes
          from within.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       She's in season. She needs to mate.

          ANGLE ON: the ERUMPENT � a large, rotund, rhino-like creature
          with a massive horn protruding from her forehead. Five times
          his size, she is nuzzling up against the enclosure of a
          terrified hippo.




                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          NEWT takes out a tiny vial of liquid � he pulls the stopper
          out with his teeth and spits it to the side before dabbing a
          spot of the liquid onto each wrist. JACOB looks at him � the
          smell is pungent.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Erumpent musk � she is mad for it.
          NEWT passes JACOB the open bottle and heads into the zoo.

                                                           TIME CUT:

          NEWT places his case down on the ground near the Erumpent and
          slowly, seductively, opens it.

          He begins to perform a 'mating ritual' � a series of grunts,
          wiggles, rolls and groans � to gain the Erumpent's attention.

          Finally the Erumpent turns away from the hippo � she is
          interested in NEWT. They face each other, circle round,
          undulating weirdly. The Erumpent's demeanour is puppy-like,
          her horn glowing orange.

          NEWT rolls along the floor � the Erumpent copies, moving
          nearer and nearer to the open case.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Good girl � come on � into the
                       case...

          JACOB takes a sniff of the Erumpent musk. As he does so, a
          fish flies through the air and jolts him, spilling the musk.
          The wind changes. Trees rustle. The Erumpent takes a deep
          breath in � she can smell the new, more powerful aroma coming
          from JACOB.

          JACOB looks around. A seal sits behind him looking guilty,
          before cheekily running away.

          When JACOB turns back, he sees the Erumpent is now on her
          feet, staring at him.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT and JACOB, realising what is about to happen.

                                                           BACK TO SCENE:

          The Erumpent charges towards the source of the smell,
          bellowing madly. JACOB wails, running as fast as he can in
          the opposite direction.

          The Erumpent gives chase � they crash through rubble and ice-
          ponds, before charging across the snow-covered park.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          Before he can finish, his wand is whipped out of his hand by
          a baboon, which runs off, clutching its prize.

          him.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT, face to face with the curious baboon, which
          examines his wand.

          NEWT breaks a bit of twig from a branch and holds it out,
          trying to persuade the baboon to trade with him.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      They're exactly the same... same
                      thing.

                                                           BACK TO JACOB:

          In trying to climb a tree, JACOB has ended up hanging
          precariously upside down from a branch.

                                   JACOB
                              (bellowing, terrified)
                      Newt!
          We see the Erumpent below him. She lies on her back, wiggling
          her legs in the air invitingly.

          ANGLE: BACK ON NEWT � the baboon shakes NEWT'S wand.

                                NEWT
                      No, no, no, don't!

          NEWT looks worried � BANG � the wand 'goes off', the spell
          knocking the baboon backwards. The wand flies back to NEWT.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      I'm so sorry-

          ANGLE ON: JACOB     � the Erumpent is now on her feet. She
          charges towards     the tree, digging her horn deep into the
          trunk. The tree     bubbles with glowing liquid before exploding
          and crashing to     the ground.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          JACOB is thrown off, rolling down a steep, snowy hill and
          onto the frozen lake below.

          The Erumpent charges    after him, hits the ice and skids. NEWT
          comes careering down    the hill, also hitting the ice. He
          performs an athletic    slide, his case open � the Erumpent is
          mere feet from JACOB    when the case swallows her.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Good show, Mr Kowalski!

          JACOB holds out his hand to shake.

                                JACOB
                      Call me Jacob.

          They shake hands.

          THIRD PERSON POV: someone watches as NEWT hauls JACOB up and
          they slip and slide across the frozen lake as fast as they
          can.

                                NEWT
                      Well, two down, one to go.

          HOLD ON: TINA as she hides on the bridge above them, peeking
          down.

                                NEWT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (to JACOB)
                      In you hop.
          We see the case sitting alone below the bridge.

          TINA quickly appears around the corner and hurriedly sits on
          the case. She closes the catches, looking shocked but
          determined.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      Ladies and gentlemen...


55        INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT                                                55

          A large, ornately decorated hall, covered in patriotic
          emblems.

          Hundreds of glamorously dressed people sit at round tables,
          looking towards a stage at the far end. Over this stage hangs
          a large poster of SENATOR SHAW with a slogan reading
          'AMERICA'S FUTURE'.

          An ANNOUNCER stands behind the microphone.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 ANNOUNCER
                       ... now tonight's keynote speaker
                       needs no introduction from me. He's
                       been mentioned as a future
                       President � and if you don't
                       believe me, just read his daddy's
                       newspapers-

          Indulgent laughter from the crowd.

          WE SEE SHAW SR and LANGDON seated at a table, surrounded by
          the cr�me de la cr�me of New York society.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                       -ladies and gentlemen, I give you
                       the Senator for New York, Henry
                       Shaw!

          Tumultuous applause.

          SENATOR SHAW bounds forwards, acknowledging the cheers,
          pointing and winking at intimates in the crowd, and mounts
          the steps.


56        EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT                                              56

          Something is streaking through the streets, too large and
          fast for a human.

          Strange, laboured breathing and snarling � it is inhuman,
          beast-like.

57        EXT. STREET NEAR CITY HALL - NIGHT                                    57

          TINA is hurrying along, clutching the case. Street lights
          start going out around her. She stops, feels something pass
          in the darkness � turns, staring, scared.


58        INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT                                                58

                                 SENATOR SHAW
                       ... and it's true we have made some
                       progress, but there is no reward
                       for idleness. So just as the odious
                       saloons have been banished...

          A strange, haunting noise comes from the organ pipes at the
          back of the room. Everyone turns to look, the SENATOR pauses.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

58        CONTINUED:                                                           58

                       ...so now the pool halls, and these
                       private parlours...

          The strange noise gets louder.

          Guests turn to look again. The SENATOR seems anxious. People
          mutter.

          Suddenly something explodes forth from underneath the organ.
          Something huge and bestial, although invisible, is soaring
          down the hall � tables fly, people are thrown, lights smash
          and people scream as it carves a line towards the stage.

          SENATOR SHAW is thrown backwards against his own poster,
          raised up high and suspended for a moment in mid-air before
          being brought down with a violent crash � DEAD.

          The 'beast' rips at his poster � a frenzied slashing with
          harsh, noisy breathing � before swarming back out from where
          it came.

          Sounds of anguish and panic from the crowd as SHAW SR fights
          through the debris towards his son's torn and bleeding body.

          ANGLE ON: SENATOR SHAW'S body, his face brutally scarred.
          SHAW SR looks devastated as he crouches beside his son.

          ANGLE ON: LANGDON, now on his feet, slightly drunk.

          Determined, perhaps triumphant.
                                  LANGDON
                       WITCHES!


59        INT. MACUSA LOBBY - NIGHT                                             59

          FOCUS ON the gigantic dial showing the MAGICAL EXPOSURE
          THREAT LEVEL. The hand moves from SEVERE to EMERGENCY.

          TINA, case in hand, runs up the lobby steps, past witches and
          wizards huddled in groups, whispering nervously.

                                  HEINRICH EBERSTADT (V.O.)
                       Our American friends have permitted

60        INT. PENTAGRAM OFFICE - NIGHT                                         60

          An impressive hall arranged like an old parliament debating
          chamber. Every seat is occupied by wizards from all parts of
          the world.

          MADAM PICQUERY is presiding, GRAVES at her side.

          The Swiss delegate is speaking.

                                HEINRICH EBERSTADT
                      ... that threatens to expose us
                      all.

                                MADAM PICQUERY
                      I will not be lectured by the man
                      who let Gellert Grindelwald slip
                      through his fingers-

          A hologram image of SENATOR SHAW'S dead and twisted body
          floats high above the room, emitting a glowing light.

          All heads turn as TINA hurries into the chamber.

                                TINA
                      Madam President, I'm so sorry to
                      interrupt, but this is critical-

          Echoing silence. TINA slides to a halt in the middle of the
          marble floor before realising exactly what she's walked into.
          The delegates stare at her.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                      You'd better have an excellent
                      excuse for this intrusion, Miss
                      Goldstein.

                                TINA
                      Yes � I do.
                           (stepping forwards to
                           address her)
                      Ma'am. Yesterday a wizard entered
                      New York with a case. This case of
                      magical creatures, and �
                      unfortunately � some have escaped.

                                MADAM PICQUERY
                      He arrived yesterday? You have
                      known for twenty-four hours that an
                      unregistered wizard set magical
                      beasts loose in New York and you
                      see fit to tell us only when a man
                      has been killed?

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

60        CONTINUED:                                                           60
                                 TINA
                       Who has been killed?

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       Where is this man?

          TINA sets the case flat on the floor and thumps the lid.
          After a second or two, it creaks open. First NEWT, then JACOB
          emerge, looking sheepish and nervous.

                                    BRITISH ENVOY
                       Scamander?

                            (closing the case)
                       Oh � er � hello, Minister.

                                 BRITISH ENVOY
                       No, this is his little brother. And
                       what in the name of Merlin are you
                       doing in New York?

                                 NEWT
                       I came to buy an Appaloosa
                       Puffskein, sir.

                                  BRITISH ENVOY
                             (suspicious)
                       Right. What are you really doing
                       here?

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                            (to TINA, about JACOB)
                       Goldstein � and who is this?

                                  TINA
                       This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam
                       President, he's a No-Maj who got
                       bitten by one of Mr Scamander's
                       creatures.

          Furious reaction from the MACUSA employees and dignitaries
          all around.

                                 MINISTERS
                            (whispers)
                       No-Maj? Obliviated?

          NEWT is absorbed in the image of SENATOR SHAW'S body floating
          around the room.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                MADAM YA ZHOU
                      You know which of your creatures
                      was responsible, Mr Scamander?

                                NEWT
                      No creature did this... don't
                      pretend! You must know what that
                      was, look at the marks...

          ANGLE ON: SENATOR SHAW'S face.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      That was an Obscurus.

          Mass consternation, muttering, exclamations. GRAVES looks
          alert.

                                MADAM PICQUERY
                      You go too far, Mr Scamander. There
                      is no Obscurial in America. Impound
                      that case, Graves!

          GRAVES summons the case; it lands next to him. NEWT draws his
          wand.

                       NEWT
             (to GRAVES)                                MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D)
          No... give that b--!                  Arrest them!
          A dazzling eruption of spells hit NEWT, TINA and JACOB, all
          of whom are slammed to their knees.

          NEWT, TINA and JACOB sitting, NEWT with his head in his
          hands, still in utter despair about his creatures.

          Finally TINA, on the verge of tears, breaks the silence.

                                TINA
                      I am so sorry about your creatures,
                      Mr Scamander. I truly am.

          NEWT remains silent.

                           (sotto voce, to TINA)
                      Can someone please tell me what
                      this Obscurial Obscurius thing is?
                      Please?

                      There hasn't been one for centuries-

                                NEWT
                      I met one in Sudan three months
                      ago. There used to be more of them
                      but they still exist. Before
                      wizards went underground, when we
                      were still being hunted by Muggles,
                      young wizards and witches sometimes
                      tried to suppress their magic to
                      avoid persecution. Instead of
                      learning to harness or to control
                      their powers, they developed what
                      was called an Obscurus.

                       It's an unstable, uncontrollable
                       dark force that busts out and � and
                       attacks... and then vanishes...

          As she talks, we see the penny dropping. An Obscurus fits
          everything she knows about the perpetrator of the New York
          attacks.

                       Obscurials can't survive long, can
                       they?

                                 NEWT
                       There's no documented case of any
                       Obscurial surviving past the age of
                       ten. The one I met in Africa was
                       eight when she � she was eight when
                       she died.

                                 JACOB
                       What are you telling me here � that
                       Senator Shaw was killed by a � by a
                       kid?

          NEWT'S look says 'yes'.


62        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY - MONTAGE                   62
          MODESTY approaches the long table at which many orphan
          children sit hungrily eating.

          The children, having finished their meal, leave the table

64        INT. MACUSA CELL/CORRIDOR - DAY                                       64

          Two EXECUTIONERS in white coats lead a shackled NEWT and TINA
          down to a dark basement, away from the cell.

          NEWT turns to look back.

                                 NEWT
                            (over his shoulder)
                       It was good to make your
                       acquaintance, Jacob, and I hope you
                       get your bakery.

          ANGLE ON: JACOB, scared, left behind, clutching at the bars
          of the cell. He waves forlornly after NEWT.


65        INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                                         65

          A small, bare room, black-walled and windowless.

          GRAVES sits opposite NEWT at an interrogation desk, a file
          open in front of him. NEWT squints forward, a bright light
          shining into his eyes.

          TINA stands behind, flanked by the two EXECUTIONERS.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                       You're an interesting man, Mr

                       Mr Graves-

          GRAVES holds a finger to his lips, signalling for TINA to be
          silent. The gesture is patronising, but authoritative.

          TINA looks kowtowed � she obeys, stepping back into the
          shadows.

          GRAVES examines the file on his desk.

                      GRAVES
          You were thrown out of                             NEWT

                       --with a beast. Yet one of your
                       teachers argued strongly against
                       your expulsion.

          Now, what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?

                                 NEWT
                       I really couldn't say.

                                 GRAVES
                       So setting a pack of dangerous
                       creatures loose here was just
                       another accident, is that right?

                                 NEWT
                       Why would I do it deliberately?

                                 GRAVES
                       To expose wizardkind. To provoke
                       war between the magical and non-
                       magical worlds.

                                 NEWT
                       Mass slaughter for the greater
                       good, you mean?

                       Yes. Quite.

                      I'm not one of Grindelwald's
                      fanatics, Mr Graves.

          A tiny change of expression tells us that NEWT has scored a
          hit. GRAVES is looking more menacing.

                                GRAVES
                      I wonder what you can tell me about
                      this, Mr Scamander?

          With a slow move of his hand, GRAVES raises up the Obscurus
          from NEWT'S case. He brings it onto the desk � it is pulsing,
          swirling and hissing.

          CLOSE ON: TINA as she stares, disbelieving.

          GRAVES reaches a hand towards the Obscurus � he's utterly
          fascinated. At his sudden close proximity, the Obscurus
          swirls faster, bubbling and shrinking backwards.

          NEWT turns instinctively to TINA. Without fully realising
          why, it is she whom he wants to convince.

                                 NEWT
                      It's an Obscurus-
                            (off her look)
                      But, it's not what you think. I
                      managed to separate it from the
                      Sudanese girl as I tried to save
                      her � I wanted to take it home, to
                      study it-
                            (off TINA'S shock)
                      But it cannot survive outside that
                      box, it could not hurt anyone,
                      Tina!

                                GRAVES
                      So it's useless without the host?

                                NEWT
                      'Useless? Useless?' That is a
                      parasitical magical force that
                      killed a child. What on earth would
                      you use it for?

          NEWT, anger finally boiling within him, stares at GRAVES.
          TINA, reacting to the atmosphere, also looks to GRAVES �
          concern and trepidation written across her face.

          GRAVES stands, brushing off the questions, turning the blame
          back onto NEWT.

          No, she's done nothing of the                     GRAVES (CONT'D)
          kind--                                --she receives the same
                                                sentence.
          The two EXECUTIONERS step forward. They calmly, intrusively,
          press the tips of their wands into NEWT and TINA'S necks.

          TINA is so overcome with shock and fear that she can barely
          speak.

                                GRAVES (CONT'D)
                           (to the EXECUTIONERS)
                      Just do it immediately. I will
                      inform President Picquery myself.
                                  NEWT
                      Tina.

          GRAVES again places a finger to his lips.

                                GRAVES
                      Shhhh.
                           (waving to the
                           EXECUTIONERS)
                      Please.


66        INT. SHABBY BASEMENT MEETING ROOM - DAY                               66

          QUEENIE is carrying a tray of coffee and mugs towards a
          meeting room.

          Suddenly she freezes, her eyes widen, a look of terror across
          her face. She drops the tray � cups smashing on the floor.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              77.

          An assortment of low-level MACUSA functionaries turn to stare
          at her. QUEENIE stares back, stunned, before running away
          down the corridor.


67        INT. CORRIDOR LEADING TO DEATH CELL - DAY                             67

          A long black metallic corridor leads into a pure white cell,
          which consists of a chair suspended magically over a square
          pool of rippling potion.

          NEWT and TINA are forced into this room by the EXECUTIONERS.
          A guard stands at the door.

                                 TINA
                            (to EXECUTIONER 1)
                       Don't do this � Bernadette � please-

                                 EXECUTIONER 1
                       It don't hurt.

          TINA is led to the edge of the pool. She begins panicking,
          her breathing heavy and erratic.

          The smiling EXECUTIONER 1 raises a wand and carefully
          extracts TINA'S happy memories from her head. TINA instantly
          calms � her expression now vacant, other-worldly.

          EXECUTIONER 1 casts the memories into the potion, which
          ripples, coming alive with scenes from TINA'S life.

          A young TINA smiles up as her mother calls.

                                 TINA'S MOTHER (V.O.)
                       Tina... Tina... come on, pumpkin �
                       time for bed. Are you ready?

                                  TINA
                       Momma...

          TINA'S MOTHER appears in the pool, her expression loving and
          warm.

          The real TINA watches, smiling down.

                                 EXECUTIONER 1
                       Don't that look good. You wanna get
                       in? Huh?

          TINA nods vacantly.
  
                                                                              78.


68        INT. MACUSA LOBBY - DAY                                               68

          QUEENIE stands in the crowded lobby. The elevator doors
          sound.

          ANGLE ON: the elevator doors, which open revealing JACOB,
          escorted by SAM, the OBLIVIATOR.

          QUEENIE hurries towards them, determined.

                                  QUEENIE
                      Hey, Sam!

                                SAM
                      Hey, Queenie.

                                QUEENIE
                      They need you downstairs. I'll
                      Obliviate this guy.

                                SAM
                      You ain't qualified.

          Grim-faced, QUEENIE reads his mind.

                                QUEENIE
                      Hey, Sam � does Cecily know you
                      been seeing Ruby?

          ANGLE ON: RUBY, a MACUSA witch, standing ahead of them. She
          smiles at SAM.

          ANGLE ON: QUEENIE and SAM � SAM looks nervous.

                                SAM
                           (appalled)
                      How'd you--?

                                QUEENIE
                      Let me Obliviate this guy and
                      she'll never hear about it from me.

          Stunned, SAM backs away.

          QUEENIE seizes JACOB'S arm and marches him off across the
          cavernous lobby.

                                JACOB
                      What are you doin'?

                                QUEENIE
                      Shhhh! Teen's in trouble, I'm
                      trying to listen-
                                (MORE)
                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                            (she reads TINA'S mind)
                       Jacob, where's Newt's case?

                                 JACOB
                       I think that guy Graves took it-

                                 QUEENIE
                       Okay, come on-

                                 JACOB
                       What? You're not gonna Obliviate
                       me?

                                 QUEENIE
                       Of course not � you're one of us
                       now!

          QUEENIE hurries him towards the main staircase.


69        INT. DEATH CELL - DAY                                                 69

          TINA sits in the execution chair.

          SHE GAZES DOWN: beneath her, swirl happy images of her
          family, her parents, a young QUEENIE.

          MEMORY:
          WE MOVE into the pool and follow one of TINA'S memories:

          TINA walks inside the Second Salem Church and up the stairs.

          She finds MARY LOU, standing over CREDENCE, belt in hand �
          CREDENCE looks terrified. In anger, TINA casts a spell,
          striking MARY LOU.

          TINA moves forward to comfort CREDENCE.

                                    TINA
                       It's okay.

          ANGLE: BACK ON REAL TINA, still gazing into the pool, smiling
          wistfully.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT, who glances quickly down his own arm �
          PICKETT is clambering, quiet and agile, towards the shackles
          holding NEWT'S hands.


70        INT. CORRIDOR LEADING TO GRAVES'S OFFICE - DAY                        70

          ANGLE ON: the door to GRAVES'S office.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              80.
70        CONTINUED:                                                           70
                                    QUEENIE (O.S.)
                       Alohomora.

          We see QUEENIE and JACOB standing awkwardly outside GRAVES'S
          office, QUEENIE trying desperately to open the door.

                                    QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                       Aberto...

          The door remains locked.

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                            (frustrated)
                       Ugh. He would know a fancy spell to
                       lock his office.


71        INT. DEATH CELL - DAY                                                 71

          Back to PICKETT as he finishes unlocking the shackles holding
          NEWT'S wrists, and quickly climbs onto EXECUTIONER 2'S coat.

                                 EXECUTIONER 2
                            (to NEWT)
                       Okay, let's get the good stuff out
                       of you-

          EXECUTIONER 2 raises her wand to NEWT'S forehead. NEWT seizes
          his opportunity � he jumps backwards out of the way before
          revealing:

          the SWOOPING EVIL, which he throws forwards towards the pool.
          He then swiftly turns and punches the guard, knocking him out
          cold.

          The SWOOPING EVIL has now expanded into a gigantic, spooky
          but weirdly beautiful butterfly-esque reptile with skeletal
          wings. It continues to circle round and round the pool.

          PICKETT clambers onto EXECUTIONER 2'S arm and bites,
          startling and distracting her, giving NEWT time to grab her
          arms and take aim with her wand.

          A spell fires, hitting EXECUTIONER 1, who drops to the floor,
          her wand falling into the pool. As it falls, the liquid rises
          up in viscous black bubbles, instantly engulfing the wand.

          In reaction, TINA'S memories turn from good to bad:

          WE SEE MARY LOU, pointing aggressively at TINA.

                                    MARY LOU
                       Witch!

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              81.
71        CONTINUED:                                                           71
          TINA, still enraptured by the pool, looks increasingly
          terrified. Her chair is lowering closer and closer to the
          liquid.

          The SWOOPING EVIL glides across the room, knocking
          EXECUTIONER 2 to the ground.


72        INT. CORRIDOR LEADING TO GRAVES'S OFFICE - DAY                        72

          After a quick glance around, JACOB gives the door a hefty
          kick. It breaks open. JACOB stands guard as QUEENIE runs in
          and grabs NEWT'S case and TINA'S wand.


73        INT. DEATH CELL - DAY                                                 73

          TINA snaps out of her reverie and screams.

                                 TINA
                       MR SCAMANDER!

          The liquid has now turned into a black bubbling death potion.
          It rises up, surrounding TINA on her chair. TINA stands up to
          get away, almost falling off in her haste. She tries
          desperately to regain her balance.

                                 NEWT
                       DON'T PANIC!

                                 TINA
                       WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO INSTEAD?

          NEWT makes a strange tutting sound, commanding the SWOOPING
          EVIL to circle the pool once more.

                                  NEWT
                       Jump...

          TINA looks at the SWOOPING EVIL � fearful, disbelieving.

                                 TINA
                       ARE YOU CRAZY?

                                 NEWT
                       Jump on him.

          NEWT stands on the edge of the pool watching the SWOOPING
          EVIL as it circles round and round TINA.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Tina, listen to me. I'll catch you.
                       Tina!

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              82.

          The two make intense eye contact, NEWT trying to reassure...

          The liquid has now risen up in waves to TINA'S full height �
          she's losing sight of NEWT.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (insistent, very calm)
                       I'll catch you. I've got you,
                       Tina...

          Suddenly NEWT cries out.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Go!

          TINA jumps in between two of the waves, just as the SWOOPING
          EVIL passes. She lands on its back, only inches away from the
          swirling liquid, then hops quickly forwards, straight into
          NEWT'S open arms.

          For a split second NEWT and TINA gaze at each other, before
          NEWT raises his hand, recalling the SWOOPING EVIL, which
          folds into a cocoon once more.

          NEWT grabs TINA'S hand and heads for the exit.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Come on!

          QUEENIE and JACOB march along the corridor with purpose.

          An alarm goes off in the distance � other wizards hurry past
          them in the opposite direction.


75        INT. MACUSA LOBBY - MINUTES LATER - DAY                               75

          The alarm blares out across the lobby.

          Confusion reigns among the crowd � people gather in groups,
          nervously chattering, others scurry about, urgent, anxious.

          A team of Aurors hurtles across the lobby, headed directly
          for the stairs leading down to the basement.


76        INT. DEATH CELL CORRIDOR/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY                      76

          NEWT and TINA, hand in hand, charge through the basement

          Suddenly accosted by the group of Aurors, they turn, darting
          behind pillars, just missing the fired curses and spells.

          NEWT again sends out the SWOOPING EVIL, which swirls
          overhead, flying in and out of pillars, blocking curses and
          knocking Aurors to the ground.

          ANGLE ON: the SWOOPING EVIL using its proboscis to probe in
          one of the Auror's ears.

                                 NEWT
                            (making a clicking sound)
                       LEAVE HIS BRAINS. Come on! Come on!

          TINA and NEWT run onwards, the SWOOPING EVIL flying after,
          blocking curses as it goes.

                                 TINA
                       What is that thing?

                                 NEWT
                       Swooping Evil.

                                 TINA
                       Well, I love it!

          ANGLE ON: QUEENIE and JACOB, walking briskly through the
          basement. NEWT and TINA sprint round the corner and almost
          collide with them. The four stare at one another, panic on
          all their faces.

          Finally QUEENIE gestures to the case.

                                  QUEENIE
                       Get in!


77        INT. STAIRS LEADING TO CELLS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                    77

          GRAVES moves down the stairs with urgency. For the first
          time, a look of panic on his face.


78        INT. MACUSA LOBBY - MINUTES LATER - DAY                               78

          QUEENIE moves quickly across the lobby floor, trying
          desperately not to be conspicuous in her haste, but acutely
          aware of the need to leave.

          A flustered ABERNATHY emerges from a crowd of wizards.

                                  ABERNATHY
                       Queenie!

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              84.
78        CONTINUED:                                                           78
          QUEENIE, poised at the top of the stairs, turns and composes
          herself. ABERNATHY moves towards her, straightening his tie,
          trying to appear calm and authoritative � QUEENIE obviously
          makes him nervous.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT'D)
                            (a large smile)
                       Where you going?

          QUEENIE puts on an alluringly innocent expression and holds
          the case behind her back.

                                 QUEENIE
                       I'm... I'm sick, Mr Abernathy.

          She coughs a little, widening her eyes.

                                 ABERNATHY
                       Again? Well � what've you got
                       there?

          A beat.

          QUEENIE thinks fast, her face quickly breaking into a
          breathtaking smile.

                                 QUEENIE
                       Ladies' things.

          QUEENIE produces the case and innocently trots up the steps
          towards ABERNATHY.
                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                       You wanna take a look? I don't
                       mind.

          ABERNATHY is overcome with embarrassment.

                                 ABERNATHY
                            (swallowing hard)
                       Oh! Good gravy, no! I � you get
                       well now!

                                 QUEENIE
                            (smiling sweetly and
                            arranging his tie)
                       Thanks!

          QUEENIE immediately turns and hurries down the stairs leaving
          ABERNATHY � heart racing � staring after her.
  
                                                                              85.


79        EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - LATE AFTERNOON                             79

          HIGH WIDE: above New York.

          WE ZOOM over rooftops before DIVING DOWN through streets and
          alleyways, past speeding cars and cackling children.

          WE COME TO REST in an alleyway at the Second Salem Church,
          where CREDENCE is pasting up posters advertising MARY LOU'S
          next meeting.

          GRAVES Apparates in the alleyway.

          CREDENCE, startled, backs away, but GRAVES makes straight for
          him, his tone and manner urgent, forceful.

                                GRAVES
                      Credence. Have you found the child?

                                  CREDENCE
                      I can't.

          GRAVES, impatient but feigning calm, holds out his hand �
          suddenly seeming caring, affectionate.

                                  GRAVES
                      Show me.

          CREDENCE whimpers and cowers, almost backing further away.
          GRAVES gently takes CREDENCE'S hand in his own and examines
          it � the hand is covered in deep red cuts, sore and bleeding.

                                GRAVES (CONT'D)
                      Shhhh. My boy, the sooner we find
                      this child, the sooner you can put
                      that pain in the past where it
                      belongs.

          GRAVES gently, almost seductively, moves his thumb across the
          cuts, healing them instantly. CREDENCE stares.

          GRAVES seems to make a decision. He puts on an earnest,
          trustworthy expression as, from his pocket, he produces a
          chain bearing the symbol of the Deathly Hallows.

                                GRAVES (CONT'D)
                      I want you to have this, Credence.
                      I would trust very few with it-

          GRAVES moves close, placing the chain around CREDENCE'S neck
          as he whispers.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              86.
79        CONTINUED:                                                           79
                                   GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Very few.

          GRAVES places his hands on either side of CREDENCE'S neck,
          drawing him in, his speech quiet, intimate.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       ... but you � you're different.

          CREDENCE is unsure, both nervous of and attracted by GRAVES'S
          behaviour.

          GRAVES rests his hand on CREDENCE'S heart, covering the
          pendant.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Now, when you find the child, touch
                       this symbol and I will know, and I
                       will come to you.

          GRAVES moves even closer to CREDENCE, his face inches from
          the boy's neck � the effect is both alluring and threatening
          � as he whispers.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Do this and you will be honoured
                       among wizards. For ever.

          GRAVES pulls CREDENCE into a hug which, with his hand on
          CREDENCE'S neck, seems more controlling than affectionate.
          CREDENCE, overwhelmed by the seeming affection, closes his
          eyes and relaxes slightly.
          GRAVES slowly backs away, stroking CREDENCE'S neck. CREDENCE
          keeps his eyes closed, longing for the human contact to
          continue.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                            (whispers)
                       The child is dying, Credence. Time
                       is running out.

          Abruptly, GRAVES strides back down the alleyway and
          Disapparates.


80        EXT. ROOFTOP WITH PIGEON COOP - DUSK                                  80

          A rooftop overlooking the whole city.

          In the middle sits a small wooden shed, which houses a pigeon
          coop.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          NEWT steps up onto a ledge and stands looking over the
          immense city. PICKETT sits on his shoulder, clicking.

          JACOB is inside the shed, looking at the pigeon coop as
          QUEENIE enters.

                                 QUEENIE
                       Your grandfather kept pigeons? Mine
                       bred owls. I used to love feeding
                       'em.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA � TINA has joined NEWT in standing on
          the ledge.

                                 TINA
                       Graves always insisted the
                       disturbances were caused by a
                       beast. We need to catch all your
                       creatures, so he can't keep using
                       them as a scapegoat.

                                 NEWT
                       There's only one still missing.
                       Dougal, my Demiguise.

                                  TINA
                       Dougal?

                                  NEWT
                       Slight problem is that... um, he's
                       invisible.

                                  TINA
                            (this is so ridiculous
                            that she can't help but
                            smile)
                       Invisible?

                                 NEWT
                       Yes � most of the time... he
                       does... um...

                                 TINA
                       How do you catch something that--

                                 NEWT
                            (beginning to smile)
                       With immense difficulty.

                                  TINA
                       Oh...



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          They smile at each other � there's a new warmth between them,
          NEWT still awkward but somehow unable to stop staring at TINA
          as she smiles.

          TINA moves slowly towards NEWT.

          A beat.

                                  TINA (CONT'D)
                      Gnarlak!

                                 NEWT
                           (taken aback)
                      Excuse me?

                                TINA
                           (conspiratorial, excited)
                      Gnarlak - he was an informant of
                      mine when I was an Auror! He used
                      to trade in magical creatures on
                      the side-

                                NEWT
                      He wouldn't happen to have an
                      interest in paw prints, would he?

                                TINA
                      He's interested in anything he can
                      sell.


81        EXT. THE BLIND PIG - NIGHT                                            81
          TINA leads the group down an insalubrious back alley covered
          in bins, crates and discarded objects. She locates a set of
          steps leading to a basement apartment and motions them down.

          The steps appear to lead to a dead end: THE DOORWAY HAS BEEN
          BRICKED UP. Instead, a poster of a simpering debutante in
          evening dress, gazing at herself in a mirror, covers the end
          of the walkway.

          TINA and QUEENIE stand in front of this poster. They turn to
          each other and, in unison, raise their wands. As they do so,
          their work clothes transform into stunning flapper party
          dresses. TINA looks up at NEWT, somewhat embarrassed by her
          new attire. QUEENIE gazes at JACOB, a cheeky smile on her
          face.

          TINA steps towards the poster and slowly raises her hand. As
          she does so, the eyes of the debutante move upwards,
          following her every move. TINA knocks slowly on the door FOUR
          TIMES.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          NEWT, sensing the need for a change, hastily magics himself a
          small bow tie. JACOB looks on, jealously.

          A HATCH OPENS: the painted eyes of the debutante whip back to
          reveal the gaze of a suspicious guard.


82        INT. THE BLIND PIG - NIGHT                                            82

          A seedy, low-ceilinged speakeasy for the down and out of New
          York's magical community. Every witch and wizard criminal in
          New York is here, their wanted posters hanging proudly on the
          walls. A glimpse of 'GELLERT GRINDELWALD: WANTED FOR NO-MAJ
          SLAYINGS IN EUROPE'.

          A glamorous goblin JAZZ SINGER croons on a stage full of
          goblin musicians, smoky images wafting from her wand to
          illustrate her lyrics. All is dingy and shabby, an atmosphere

                       The phoenix cried fat tears of
                       pearl,
                       When the dragon snapped up his best
                       girl,
                       And the Billywig forgot to twirl,
                       When his sweetheart left him cold,
                       And the unicorn done lost his horn,
                       And the Hippogriff feels all
                       forlorn,
                       'Cause their lady loves have upped
                       and gawn,
                       Or that's what I've been told-

          JACOB stands at the seemingly unmanned bar, waiting to be
          served.

                                 JACOB
                       How do I get a drink in this joint?

          Out of nowhere, a thin bottle of brown liquid zooms towards
          him. He catches it, stunned.

          The head of a HOUSE-ELF peers up at him from behind the bar.

                                 HOUSE-ELF
                       What? Ain't you ever seen a house-
                       elf before?

                                 JACOB
                       Oh, no, yeah, no, yeah of course I
                       have... I love house-elves.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          JACOB tries to act nonchalant � he removes the cork from the
          bottle.

                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                       My uncle's a house-elf.

          The HOUSE-ELF � not fooled � raises himself up, leaning on
          the bar to stare at JACOB.

          QUEENIE approaches. She looks downcast as she orders.

                                 QUEENIE
                       Six shots of gigglewater and a lobe
                       blaster, please.

          The HOUSE-ELF reluctantly shuffles off to fulfil her request.
          JACOB and QUEENIE look at each other. JACOB reaches out and
          takes one of the gigglewater shots.

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                       Are all No-Majs like you?

                                 JACOB
                            (trying to be serious,
                            almost seductive)
                       No, I'm the only one like me.

          Maintaining strong eye contact with QUEENIE, JACOB knocks
          back the shot. Suddenly he emits a raucous, high-pitched
          giggle. QUEENIE laughs sweetly at his look of surprise.

          ANGLE ON: a HOUSE-ELF serving a drink to a giant, whose hand
          dwarfs the mug he is handed.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA sitting at a table alone. There's an
          awkward silence. NEWT studies the characters in the room:

          Hooded and heavily scarred witches and wizards gamble magical
          artefacts in a game with runic dice.

                                  TINA
                             (looking around)
                       I've arrested half of the people in
                       here.

                                 NEWT
                       You can tell me to mind my own
                       business... but I saw something in
                       that death potion back there. I saw
                       you � hugging � that Second Salem
                       boy.

                      His name's Credence. His mother
                      beats him. She beats all those kids
                      she adopted, but she seems to hate
                      him the most.

                                NEWT
                           (realising)
                      And she was the No-Maj you
                      attacked?

                                TINA
                      That's how I lost my job. I went
                      for her in front of a meeting of
                      her crazy followers � they all had
                      to be Obliviated. It was a big
                      scandal.

          QUEENIE signals from across the room.

                                QUEENIE
                           (whispers)
                      It's him.

          GNARLAK has emerged from the depths of the speakeasy. Smoking
          a cigar and smartly dressed, for a goblin, he has a sly,
          smooth demeanour like a mafia boss. He eyes the newcomers as
          he walks.

                      Yes, love has set the beasts astir,
                      The dang'rous and the meek concur,
                      It's ruffled feathers, fleece and
                      fur,
                      'Cause love drives all of us wild.

          GNARLAK sits himself at the end of their table, an air of
          confidence and dangerous control. A HOUSE-ELF hastily brings
          him a drink.

                                GNARLAK
                      So � you're the guy with the case
                      full of monsters, huh?

                                NEWT
                      News travels fast. I was hoping
                      you'd be able to tell me if there
                      have been any sightings. Tracks.
                      That sort of thing.

          GNARLAK downs his drink. Another HOUSE-ELF brings him a
          document to sign.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      You've got a big price on your
                      head, Mr Scamander. Why should I
                      help you instead of turnin' you in?

                                NEWT
                      I take it I'll have to make it
                      worth your while?

          The HOUSE-ELF scurries off holding the signed document.

                                GNARLAK
                      Hmm � let's consider it a cover
                      charge.

          NEWT pulls out a couple of Galleons and slides them across
          the table towards GNARLAK, who barely looks up.

                                 GNARLAK (CONT'D)
                            (not impressed)
                      Huh � MACUSA's offerin' more'n
                      that.

          A beat.

          NEWT pulls out a beautiful metal instrument and places it on
          the table.

                                GNARLAK (CONT'D)
                      Lunascope? I got five.

          NEWT rummages in his coat pocket and pulls out a glowing,
          frozen ruby egg instead.

                                NEWT
                      Frozen Ashwinder egg!

                                GNARLAK
                           (finally interested)
                      You see � now we're--

          GNARLAK suddenly spots PICKETT, who is peeking out of NEWT'S
          pocket.

                                GNARLAK (CONT'D)
                      --wait a minute � that's a
                      Bowtruckle, right?

          PICKETT quickly retreats and NEWT puts a hand protectively
          over his pocket.

                                  NEWT
                      No.

                      they pick locks � am I right?

                                NEWT
                      You're not having him.

                                GNARLAK
                      Well, good luck gettin' back alive,
                      Mr Scamander, what with the whole
                      of MACUSA on your back.

          GNARLAK gets up and walks away.

                                 NEWT
                           (in agony)
                      All right.

          GNARLAK, turned away from NEWT, smiles viciously.

          NEWT extracts PICKETT from his pocket. PICKETT clings to
          NEWT'S hands, madly clicking and whining.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Pickett...

          NEWT slowly hands PICKETT over to GNARLAK. PICKETT reaches
          his little arms forward, imploring NEWT to take him back.
          NEWT cannot look at him.

                                GNARLAK
                      Ah, yeah...

                      Somethin' invisible's been wreakin'

                      wondering what you knew of his
                      background.

          GNARLAK stares. A sense that there is much that he could say
          � and that he'd rather die than say it.

                      You ask too many questions, Mr
                      Scamander. That can get you killed.

                                HOUSE-ELF
                      MACUSA ARE COMING!

          The HOUSE-ELF Disapparates. Other customers throughout the
          bar hurriedly do the same.

                                TINA
                           (getting to her feet)
                      You tipped them off!

          GNARLAK stares at them, chuckling menacingly.

          Behind QUEENIE, the wanted posters on the wall update to show
          NEWT and TINA'S faces.

          Aurors begin Apparating into the speakeasy.

          JACOB, seemingly innocent, saunters up to GNARLAK.

                                JACOB
                      Sorry, Mr Gnarlak--

          JACOB punches GNARLAK straight in the face, knocking him
          backwards. QUEENIE looks delighted.

                                JACOB (CONT'D)
                      --reminds me of my foreman!

          Throughout the bar, various customers are being apprehended
          by the Aurors.

          NEWT scrambles about on the floor looking for PICKETT. Around
          him people are running, diving away from Aurors, trying to
          escape the bar.

          NEWT finally finds PICKETT on a table leg, grabs him and runs
          towards his group.

          JACOB grabs another shot of gigglewater and knocks it back.
          He giggles uproariously as NEWT grabs his elbow and the group
          Disapparates.

          There's barely any noise. CHASTITY sits primly at the long
          table in the middle of the church. She formulaically arranges
          leaflets and places them in little bags. MODESTY sits
          opposite in a nightdress, reading a book. In the deep
          background, MARY LOU busies herself in her bedroom.

          MODESTY is the only one to register a small clunk from
          upstairs.

          A bleak room. A single bed, an oil-lamp, a sampler on the
          wall: AN ALPHABET OF SIN.

          MODESTY'S dolls lined up on a shelf. One with a little noose
          around its neck, another tied to a stake.

          CREDENCE scrabbles to get underneath MODESTY'S bed. He looks
          among the boxes and objects hidden there, then suddenly
          stops, staring...

          MODESTY stands at the bottom of the stairs, looking up. She
          slowly ascends.


86        INT. MODESTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                        86

          ANGLE ON: CREDENCE'S face under the bed � CREDENCE has found
          a toy wand. He stares, unable to draw his eyes from it.

          Behind him, MODESTY enters.

                                 MODESTY
                       Whatchoo doin', Credence?

          CREDENCE bangs his head on the bed in his haste to get out.
          He emerges, dusty and scared. He is relieved to see that it
          is only MODESTY but she, on seeing the wand, is terrified.

                                 CREDENCE
                       Where'd you get this?

                                 MODESTY
                            (frightened whisper)
                       Give it back, Credence. It's just a
                       toy!

          The door bangs open.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              96.

          MARY LOU enters. Her gaze travels from MODESTY to CREDENCE
          and the toy wand � she is angrier than we have ever seen her.

                                 MARY LOU
                            (to CREDENCE)
                       What is this?


87        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT                                      87

          HOLD ON: CHASTITY, still filling bags with leaflets.

                                 MARY LOU (O.S.)
                       Take it off!

          CHASTITY glances up towards the landing.


88        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT                    88

          MARY LOU stands on the landing overlooking the main church
          below. Seen from below her figure is powerful, almost
          deified.

          MARY LOU turns back towards CREDENCE and slowly, her face
          full of loathing, snaps the wand in two.

          As MODESTY cowers, CREDENCE begins to remove his belt. MARY
          LOU holds out her hand and takes it.

                                    CREDENCE
                               (pleading)
                       Ma...

                                 MARY LOU
                       I am not your ma! Your mother was a
                       wicked, unnatural woman!

          MODESTY forces her way between them.

                                 MODESTY
                       It was mine.

                                    MARY LOU
                       Modesty-

          Suddenly the belt is whipped out of MARY LOU'S hands by
          supernatural means and falls like a dead snake in a far
          corner. MARY LOU looks at her hand � it is cut and bleeding
          from the force of the movement.

          MARY LOU is stunned � she glances between MODESTY and
          CREDENCE.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              97.
88        CONTINUED:                                                           88
                                 MARY LOU (CONT'D)
                            (frightened but covering
                            it)
                       What is this?

          MODESTY stares defiantly directly back at her.
          In the background WE SEE CREDENCE crouched down, hugging his
          knees and shaking.

          Trying to remain composed, MARY LOU moves slowly to retrieve
          the belt. Before she can touch it, the belt slithers away
          across the floor.

          MARY LOU backs away, tears of fear welling in her eyes. She
          turns slowly back towards the children.

          As she moves, an almighty force explodes into her: a bestial,
          screeching, dark mass that consumes her. Her scream is blood-
          curdling as the force throws her backwards, striking a wooden
          beam, flinging her over the balcony.

          MARY LOU smashes down onto the floor of the main church, her
          body lifeless, her face bearing the same scars seen on the
          face of SENATOR SHAW.

          The Dark force flies through the church, upending the table
          and destroying everything in sight.


89        EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                                         89
          WIDE SHOT: a department store, its windows full of
          glamorously dressed mannequins.

          JACOB approaches   the shop windows staring at a handbag which,
          seemingly of its   own accord, is sliding down the arm of a
          mannequin. NEWT,   TINA and QUEENIE hurry up behind him and
          watch as the bag   hovers in mid-air and floats off into the
          store.


90        INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                                         90

          A well-presented department store decorated for Christmas,
          with aisles full of expensive jewellery, shoes, hats and
          perfume. The place is shut down for the night, all the lights
          are off, no noises can be heard.

          We see the handbag float down the central aisle, accompanied
          by small grunting noises.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              98.
90        CONTINUED:                                                           90
          NEWT and the group quickly tiptoe through the store, coming
          to hide behind a large plastic Christmas display. They eye up
          the floating handbag.

                                 NEWT
                            (whispers)
                       So Demiguises are fundamentally
                       peaceful, but they can give a nasty
                       nip if provoked.

          The Demiguise itself appears � a silvery-haired, orangutan-
          like creature, with a curious, wizened face � clambering over
          a display to reach a box of sweets.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (to JACOB and QUEENIE)
                       You two... head that way.

          They start moving.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       And try very hard not to be
                       predictable.

          JACOB and QUEENIE exchange perplexed glances before heading
          off.

          A small roar can be heard in the distance.

          ANGLE ON: the Demiguise which, on hearing the sound, looks up
          towards the ceiling, before continuing to gather sweets, now
          shovelling them into its handbag.
                                 TINA (O.S.)
                       Was that the Demiguise?

                                 NEWT
                       No, I think it might be the reason
                       that the Demiguise is here.

          ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA, moving swiftly down an aisle towards
          the Demiguise, which is now moving away through the store.

          Realising it's been spotted, the Demiguise turns and looks at
          NEWT quizzically, before moving up a set of side stairs. NEWT
          smiles and moves to follow.


91        INT. DEPARTMENT STORE, ATTIC STOREROOM - NIGHT                        91

          A huge, dark attic-space, filled floor to ceiling with
          shelves packed with boxes of china: dinner services, teacups
          and general kitchenware.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                              99.
91        CONTINUED:                                                           91
          The Demiguise walks along the attic in a patch of moonlight.
          It glances around before stopping and emptying its handbag
          full of confectionery.

                                 NEWT (O.S.)
                       Its sight operates on probability,
                       so it can foresee the most likely
                       immediate future.

          NEWT comes into view, creeping up behind the Demiguise.

                                 TINA (O.S.)
                       So what's it doing now?

                                 NEWT
                       It's babysitting.

          The Demiguise holds up one of the sweets, seeming to offer it
          up to someone or something.

                                 TINA
                       What did you just say-?

                                 NEWT
                            (calm and whispering)
                       This is my fault. I thought I had
                       them all � but I must have
                       miscounted.

          JACOB and QUEENIE enter quietly. NEWT moves calmly forwards
          and kneels beside the Demiguise, which makes space for him in
          front of the sweets. NEWT carefully places his case down.

          ANGLE ON: TINA, a shift of light reveals the scales of a
          large creature hiding in the rafters of the attic. TINA looks
          up in horror.

                                 TINA
                       It was babysitting that?

          ANGLE ON: the ceiling as the face of an Occamy comes into
          view � just like the small blue snake-like birds seen in the
          case, this Occamy is huge, coiled round and round itself to
          fill the entire attic roof-space.

          The Occamy moves slowly down towards NEWT and the Demiguise
          who, again, offers up a sweet. NEWT remains very still.

                                 NEWT
                       Occamies are choranaptyxic. So they
                       � grow � to fill � available �
                       space.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                             100.
91        CONTINUED: (2)                                                       91
          The Occamy spots NEWT, and cranes its head towards him. NEWT
          holds up a hand, gently.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Mummy's here.

          ANGLE ON: the Demiguise, whose eyes flash a brilliant blue �
          a sign that it's having a premonition.

                                                           FLASHCUTS:

          A Christmas bauble rolls across the floor; the Occamy is
          panicking, NEWT clasping its back, being flung about the
          room; the Demiguise is suddenly on JACOB'S back.

                                                           BACK TO:

          The Demiguise as its eyes turn back to brown.

          QUEENIE moves slowly forward, staring at the Occamy. As she
          does so she accidentally kicks a tiny glass bauble on the
          floor, which jingles as it rolls. At the sound, the Occamy
          rears up, screeching. NEWT tries to calm the large creature.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Woah! Woah!

          JACOB and QUEENIE stagger backwards to find cover. The
          Demiguise runs away and jumps into JACOB'S arms.

          The Occamy swoops, scooping NEWT up onto its back as it
          violently thrashes about the attic, sending shelves flying.
          NEWT shouts out.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      Right, we need an insect, any kind
                      of insect � and a teapot! Find a
                      teapot!

          TINA army-crawls through the chaos, dodging falling items,
          trying to find what NEWT has asked for.

          The wings of the Occamy crash down to the floor, narrowly
          missing JACOB as he stumbles around, encumbered by the
          Demiguise now clinging to his back.

          NEWT finds it harder and harder to hold on as the Occamy
          becomes more and more distressed, its wings now thrashing
          upwards, destroying the roof of the building.

          JACOB turns, he and the Demiguise spotting a stray cockroach
          on a crate.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          JACOB reaches his hand up to grab it, when part of the Occamy
          crashes down, destroying the crate and his chance.

          ANGLE ON: TINA, crawling across the floor with great
          determination, in hot pursuit of a cockroach.

          ANGLE ON: QUEENIE, who screams as she's knocked to the floor
          by the force of the Occamy.

          JACOB runs up behind her and dives forwards, flat onto the
          floor, finally laying claim to a cockroach. TINA stands,
          clutching a teapot and screaming.

                                  TINA
                      Teapot!

          AT THIS NOISE, the Occamy rears its head once more, causing
          its tail to writhe, squashing and pinning JACOB � with the
          Demiguise � against one of the rafters.

          JACOB and TINA are now at opposite ends of the room, neither
          daring to move, swathes of Occamy scales between them.

          ANGLE ON: JACOB and the Demiguise � the Demiguise looks
          shiftily up to the side and promptly vanishes. JACOB slowly
          turns to follow the Demiguise's gaze � the Occamy's face is
          inches away from his own, staring with full intensity at the
          cockroach in his hand. JACOB barely dares to breathe.

          NEWT peers round from behind the Occamy's head and whispers.

                                NEWT
                      Roach in teapot...

          JACOB gulps, trying not to make eye contact with the huge
          creature next to him.

                                JACOB
                           (trying to soothe the
                           Occamy)
                      Shhhh!

          JACOB widens his eyes at TINA, warning her of his intent.

          IN SLOW MOTION: JACOB throws the roach. We watch it soar
          through the air as the Occamy's body begins to move once
          more, uncurling and swirling round the room.

          NEWT jumps from the Occamy's back, landing safely on the
          floor, while QUEENIE takes cover, placing a colander over her
          head.

          TINA runs, teapot outstretched, hurdling over the Occamy's
          coils as she goes � a heroic sight. She lands on her knees in
          the centre of the room, the cockroach falling perfectly into
          the teapot.

          The Occamy rears up, shrinking rapidly as it rises, before
          diving down head first. TINA lowers her head, bracing herself
          for a hit. The Occamy races down towards the teapot, and
          glides seamlessly inside.

          NEWT races forwards and jams a lid on top of the teapot. He
          and TINA breathe heavily: relief.

                      Choranaptyxic. They also shrink to
                      fit the available space.

          ANGLE: INSIDE THE TEAPOT: the now tiny Occamy gobbling down
          its cockroach.

                                TINA
                      Tell me the truth � was that
                      everything that came out of the
                      case?

                                NEWT
                      That's everything � and that's the
                      truth.

          JACOB holds the Demiguise's hand, leading it through its
          enclosure.

                                NEWT (O.S.)
                      Here she comes.

          JACOB lifts the Demiguise up and into its nest.

                                JACOB
                           (to the Demiguise)
                      Happy to be home? Bet you're
                      exhausted, buddy. Come on � there
                      you go � that's right.

          TINA is tentatively holding the baby Occamy. Supervised by
          NEWT, she places it gently into its nest.

          HOLD ON: TINA as she looks around at the Erumpent, now
          stamping through her enclosure. TINA'S face is full of wonder
          and admiration. JACOB chuckles at her expression.


                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          PICKETT gives NEWT a sharp pinch from inside his pocket.

                                  NEWT
                       Ouch!

          NEWT fishes PICKETT out, holding him up on his hand as he
          walks through the various enclosures.

          WE SEE the Niffler sitting in a small enclave, surrounded by
          its various treasures.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Right... I think we need to talk.
                       See, I wouldn't have let him keep
                       you, Pickett.

          Pick, I would rather chop off my hand than get rid of you...
          after everything you have done for me � now come on.

          NEWT has reached FRANK'S area.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       Pick � we've talked about sulking
                       before, haven't we? Pickett � come
                       on, give me a smile. Pickett, give
                       me a...

          PICKETT sticks out his tiny tongue and blows a raspberry at
          NEWT.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       All right � now, that is beneath
                       you.

          NEWT places PICKETT on his shoulder and starts busying
          himself with various buckets of feed.

          ANGLE ON: a photograph inside NEWT'S shed, which shows a
          beautiful girl � the girl smiles suggestively. QUEENIE stares
          at the photo.

                                 QUEENIE
                       Hey, Newt. Who is she?

                                 NEWT
                       Ah... that's no one.

                             (reading his mind)

                       family. Aren't they kinda � you

                      Please don't read my mind.

          A beat as QUEENIE drinks the whole story out of NEWT'S head.
          She looks both intrigued and saddened. NEWT continues to
          work, trying hard to pretend QUEENIE isn't reading his mind.

          QUEENIE steps forwards, closer to NEWT.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                           (angry, embarrassed)
                      Sorry, I asked you not to.

                                QUEENIE
                      I know, I'm sorry, I can't help it.
                      People are easiest to read when
                      they're hurting.

                                NEWT
                      I'm not hurting. Anyway, it was a
                      long time ago.

                                QUEENIE
                      That was a real close friendship
                      you had at school.

          Yes, well, neither of us              years.
          really fitted in at school,
          so we--
          In the background we see TINA, who has noticed that NEWT and
          QUEENIE are talking.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                           (concerned)
                      She was a taker. You need a giver.

          TINA walks towards them.

                                TINA
                      What are you two talking about?

          A gigantic crack of thunder. The Thunderbird, FRANK, rises
          into the air screeching, flapping his wings vigorously, his
          body turning black and gold, his eyes flashing lightning.

          NEWT stands, examining the bird, concerned.

                                NEWT
                      Danger. He senses danger.


93        EXT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT                                      93

          GRAVES Apparates in the shadows. Wand drawn, he slowly
          approaches the church, examining the scene of decimation.
          Rather than nervous, he seems intrigued, almost excited.


94        INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT                                      94

          The place is destroyed � moonlight filters through gaps in
          the roof, and CHASTITY lies dead amid debris from the attack.

          GRAVES slowly enters the church, wand still drawn. Eerie
          sobbing can be heard from somewhere in the building.

          MARY LOU'S body lies on the floor in front of him � the marks
          on her face visible in the moonlight. GRAVES considers the
          corpse: a realisation dawning on his face � no horror, merely
          wariness and intense interest.

          FOCUS ON: CREDENCE, cowering at the back of the church,
          whimpering and clutching his pendant of the Deathly Hallows.



                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          GRAVES steps quickly towards him, bends down, cradling
          CREDENCE'S head. However, there's little tenderness to his
          voice as he speaks.

                                 GRAVES

                       she go?

          CREDENCE looks up into GRAVES'S face � he is utterly
          traumatised and unable to explain � his face a plea for
          affection.

                                 CREDENCE
                       Help me. Help me.

                       Didn't you tell me you had another
                       sister?

          CREDENCE begins to weep again. GRAVES places a hand on his
          neck, his face contorting with stress as he tries to remain
          calm.

                                 CREDENCE
                       Please help me.

                                 CREDENCE
                       Please help me.

          Suddenly vicious, GRAVES slaps CREDENCE hard across the face.

          CREDENCE, stunned, stares at GRAVES.

                                 GRAVES
                       Your sister's in grave danger. We

          CREDENCE is aghast, unable to comprehend that his hero has
          hit him.

          GRAVES grabs him and pulls him up onto his feet, as they
          Disapparate.
  
                                                                             107.

          tenement building.

          Inside, the building is miserable, dilapidated.

          CREDENCE and GRAVES climb the stairwell.

                      From a family of twelve. She still
                      misses her brothers and sisters.
                      She still talks about them.

          GRAVES, wand in hand, looks around the landing � there are
          numerous darkened doorways stretching out in several
          directions.

          CREDENCE, still shell-shocked, has stopped in the stairwell.

                                GRAVES
                      Where is she?

          CREDENCE looks down � at a loss.

                                CREDENCE
                      I don't know.

          GRAVES becomes increasingly impatient � he's so close to his
          goal. He marches forward into one of the rooms.

                                GRAVES
                           (contemptuous)
                      You're a Squib, Credence. I could
                      smell it off you the minute I met
                      you.

          CREDENCE'S face falls.

                                  CREDENCE
                      What?

          GRAVES marches back along the corridor to try another room.
          His pretence of care for CREDENCE all but forgotten.

                       You're unteachable. Your mother's

          GRAVES points to another landing.

                       I'm done with you.

          CREDENCE doesn't move. He stares after GRAVES, his breathing
          becoming shallow and quick, as though he's trying to contain
          something.

          GRAVES moves through the dark rooms. A tiny movement
          somewhere close.

                                  GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Modesty?

          GRAVES advances cautiously into a derelict schoolroom at the
          end of a corridor.


97        INT. TENEMENT IN THE BRONX, DERELICT ROOM - NIGHT                     97
          ANGLE ON: MODESTY cowering in a corner, wide-eyed with fear
          and shaking as GRAVES approaches.

                                 GRAVES
                            (whispering)
                       Modesty.

          GRAVES bends down and puts his wand away � once again playing
          the soothing parent.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                            (gentle)
                       There's no need to be afraid. I'm
                       here with your brother, Credence.

          MODESTY whimpers with terror at the mention of CREDENCE.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Out you come now...

          GRAVES extends his hand.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
  
                                                                             109.
97        CONTINUED:                                                           97
          A faint jingle sounds.

          ANGLE ON: the ceiling as cracks begin to appear, spreading
          like a spider's web. Dust begins to fall as the walls shake
          uncontrollably, the room beginning to disintegrate around
          them.

          GRAVES stands. He looks down at MODESTY, but she is clearly
          terrified and not the source of this magic.

          GRAVES turns and slowly draws his wand, the wall in front of
          him collapsing as though turned to sand, revealing another
          wall ahead. MODESTY is nothing to him now.

          As each wall collapses in front of him he is transfixed,
          elated, yet also aware that he has made a colossal error...

          The final wall collapses. He is facing CREDENCE, who stares
          at him, unable to control his fury, his sense of betrayal,
          his bitterness.

                                 GRAVES (CONT'D)
                       Credence... I owe you an apology...

                                 CREDENCE
                       I trusted you. I thought you were
                       my friend. That you were different.

          CREDENCE'S face begins to contort, his rage tearing him from
          within.

                                 GRAVES
                       You can control it, Credence.

                                 CREDENCE
                            (whispers, making eye
                            contact finally)
                       But I don't think I want to, Mr
                       Graves.

          The Obscurus moves horribly beneath CREDENCE'S skin. An awful
          inhuman growl comes out of his mouth, from which something
          dark begins to bloom.

          This force finally takes over CREDENCE, his whole body
          exploding into a dark mass which hurtles forwards out of the
          window, narrowly missing GRAVES.

          GRAVES stands, watching as the Obscurus zooms out and over
          the city.
  
                                                                             110.


98        EXT. TENEMENT IN THE BRONX - NIGHT                                    98

          WE FOLLOW the Obscurus as it churns and twists through the
          city, wreaking havoc: cars are sent flying, pavements explode
          and buildings are demolished � the Obscurus leaves only
          destruction in its wake.


99        EXT. SQUIRE'S ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                         99

          NEWT, TINA, JACOB and QUEENIE stand on the rooftop underneath
          a large 'SQUIRE'S' sign. From the edge they have a clear view
          of the chaos going on below.

                                JACOB
                           (overstimulated)
                      Jeez... is that the Obscuria-thing?

          Sirens sound. NEWT is staring, registering the scale of the
          destruction.

                                NEWT
                      That's more powerful than any
                      Obscurial I have ever heard of...

          A particularly loud explosion in the distance. The city
          beneath them is starting to burn. NEWT thrusts his case into
          TINA'S hands and takes a journal from his pocket.

                                NEWT (CONT'D)
                      If I don't come back, look after my
                      creatures. Everything that you need
                      to know is in there.

          He hands her the journal, barely able to make eye contact.

                                   TINA
                      What?

                                NEWT
                           (looking back to the
                           Obscurus)
                      They're not killing it.

          Their eyes meet � a moment full of what they might have said
          to each other � before NEWT jumps from the roof and
          Disapparates.

                                   TINA
                              (distraught)
                      NEWT!

          TINA slams the case into QUEENIE'S arms.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)
   
                                                                              111.
99         CONTINUED:                                                           99
                                  TINA (CONT'D)
                        You heard him � look after them!

           TINA also Disapparates. QUEENIE shoves the case at JACOB.

                                  QUEENIE
                        Keep holda that, honey.
           She moves to Disapparate, but JACOB hangs on to her and she
           falters.

                                  JACOB
                        No, no, no!

                                   QUEENIE
                        I can't take you. Please let go of
                        me, Jacob!

                                  JACOB
                        Hey, hey! You're the one that said
                        I was one of youse... right?

                                  QUEENIE
                        It's too dangerous.

           A further massive explosion in the distance. JACOB tightens
           his grip on QUEENIE. She reads his mind and her expression
           changes to one of wonderment and tenderness as she sees what
           he went through in the war. QUEENIE is moved and appalled.
           Very slowly, she raises a hand and touches his cheek.

100        EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT                                           100

           The scene is one of total chaos.

           Buildings are on fire, people scream and run in all
           directions, cars lie destroyed in the road.

           GRAVES prowls through the Square, oblivious to the distress
           around him, his focus concentrated on only one thing.

           The Obscurus writhes at one end of the Square, its energy
           angrier now � moving through layers of hurt and anguish, the
           products of isolation and torment � flecks of red light
           roaring from within. CREDENCE'S face is just discernible
           within the mass, distorted, pained. GRAVES stands before it,
           triumphant.

           NEWT Apparates from further down the street and watches.




                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                  GRAVES
                             (shouting to reach
                             CREDENCE over the
                             almighty noise)
                        To survive so long, with this
                        inside you, Credence, is a miracle.
                        You are a miracle. Come with me �
                        think of what we could achieve
                        together.

           The Obscurus moves    closer to GRAVES � we hear a scream from
           within the mass as    its Dark energy bursts out once more,
           knocking GRAVES to    the ground. The force sends a shockwave
           round the Square �    NEWT dives behind a fallen car for cover.

           TINA Apparates into the Square and takes cover by another
           burning vehicle close to NEWT. They look at each other.

                                   TINA
                        Newt!

                                   NEWT
                        It's the Second Salem boy. He's the
                        Obscurial.

                                  TINA
                        He's not a child.

                                  NEWT
                        I know � but I saw him � his power
                        must be so strong � he's somehow
                        managed to survive. It's
                        incredible.

           As the Obscurus screams once more, TINA makes a decision.

                                  TINA
                        Newt! Save him.

           TINA dashes out towards GRAVES. NEWT, understanding,
           Disapparates.


101        EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT                                           101

           GRAVES is moving nearer and nearer to the Obscurus, which
           continues to scream and wail at his presence. He takes out
           his wand, poised...

           TINA runs INTO VIEW behind GRAVES. She fires at him, but he
           turns just in time � his reactions marvellous, astounding.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           The Obscurus now vanishes. GRAVES, thoroughly irritated,
           advances on TINA, deflecting her spells with perfect ease.

                                  GRAVES
                        Tina. You're always turning up
                        where you are least wanted.

           GRAVES summons an abandoned car, which whooshes through the
           air, forcing TINA to dive out of the way, just in time.

           By the time TINA has gathered herself up from the ground,
           GRAVES has Disapparated.


102        INT. MAJOR INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT, MACUSA - NIGHT                 102

           A metallic map of New York City lights up to show areas of
           intense magical activity.

           MADAM PICQUERY, surrounded by top Aurors, looks on, aghast.

                                  MADAM PICQUERY
                        Contain this, or we are exposed and
                        it will mean war.

           The Aurors immediately Disapparate.


103        EXT. ROOFTOPS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT                                   103

           NEWT race�Apparates as fast as he can across the tops of
           buildings in pursuit of the Obscurus.

                                  NEWT
                        Credence! Credence! I can help you.

           The Obscurus dives towards NEWT, who Disapparates just in
           time, before continuing to chase it across the rooftops.

           As he runs, spells explode around him, disintegrating the
           rooftops. A dozen Aurors have appeared, attacking the
           Obscurus from ahead, and almost taking out NEWT, who leaps
           for cover, trying desperately to keep up.

           The Obscurus veers to avoid the spells, leaving black snow-
           like particles that drift across the rooftops as it retreats
           screaming, and turns down another block.

           In a particularly vigorous display, the Obscurus now rises
           dramatically up into the air, as spells in electric blue and
           white hit it from all angles.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           Finally it crashes to the ground and races along a wide,
           empty street � a black tsunami destroying anything in its
           path.


104        EXT. OUTSIDE A SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT                               104

           A line of policemen stand with their guns aimed at the
           terrifying supernatural force powering towards them.

           Their faces turn from confused alarm to total panic as they
           see the mass swarming ahead, making straight for them. They
           fire their guns � their efforts futile in the face of such a
           seemingly unstoppable kinetic mass.

           Finally they disband, fleeing down the street, just as the
           Obscurus reaches them.


105        EXT. ROOFTOPS/STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT                           105

           ANGLE ON: NEWT, standing on top of a skyscraper looking out
           as the Obscurus rises up over the surrounding buildings and
           slams spectacularly into the ground just outside the City
           Hall subway entrance.

           Sudden quiet. A pulsing, heaving, screechy breathing emanates
           from the Obscurus where it rests at the entrance.

           Finally, as NEWT watches, we see the black mass shrink to
           nothing, and the small figure of CREDENCE descends the steps
           into the subway.


106        INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT                                                 106

           NEWT Apparates into the City Hall subway, a long, mosaicked
           Art Deco station tunnel, which bears the signs of having been
           crossed by the Obscurus: the chandelier creaks, a few tiles
           have fallen.

           We can hear its deep breathing, cornered, like a frightened
           panther.

           NEWT creeps along the platform, trying to find the epicentre
           of the sound, as the Obscurus slides down the ceiling.


107        EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                        107

           Aurors surround the entrance to the subway. Pointing their
           wands at the pavement and into the sky, they draw an

           We hear more Aurors arrive, among them GRAVES � scanning,
           calculating and immediately taking charge.

                                  GRAVES
                        Bar the area. I don't want anyone
                        else down there!

           As the magical field is almost complete, a figure rolls
           underneath it and dashes unseen into the subway � TINA.


108        INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT                                                 108

           NEWT has reached the Obscurus in the shadows of a tunnel. Now
           much calmer, it gently swirls in the air above the train
           tracks. NEWT hides behind a pillar as he talks.

                                  NEWT
                        Credence... it's Credence, isn't
                        it? I'm here to help you, Credence.
                        I'm not here to hurt you.

           In the distance we hear footsteps, the pacing controlled,
           deliberate.

           NEWT moves out from behind the pillar, and steps onto the
           train tracks. Within the mass of the Obscurus we can see a
           shadow of CREDENCE, curled up, scared.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                        I've met someone just like     you,
                        Credence. A girl � a young     girl
                        who'd been imprisoned, she     had been
                        locked away and she'd been     punished
                        for her magic.

           CREDENCE is listening � he never dreamed there was another.
           Slowly the Obscurus melts away, leaving only CREDENCE,
           huddled on the train tracks � a frightened child.

           NEWT crouches on the floor. CREDENCE looks to him, the
           tiniest trace of hope dawning in his expression: might there
           be a way back?

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                        Credence, can I come over to you?
                        Can I come over?

           NEWT slowly moves forwards, but as he does so a sharp burst
           of light blazes out from the darkness and a spell strikes,
           throwing him backwards.

           GRAVES marches down the tunnel with intense purpose.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           CREDENCE begins to run as GRAVES fires further spells at
           NEWT, who rolls out of the way towards the tunnel's central
           pillars.

           From here NEWT tries to fire back, but his efforts are easily
           deflected.

           CREDENCE continues to lumber down the tracks but stops � a
           rabbit caught in the headlights � as a train approaches, its
           lights glaring from the darkness.

           It is up to GRAVES to save CREDENCE � magically casting him
           out of the train's path.

           MADAM PICQUERY surveys the situation from under the magical
           force field.

           ANGLE FROM THE CROWD AND POLICE'S POV:

           People begin to swarm around the subway, their cries and
           chatter becoming louder as they stare at the magical bubble
           surrounding the subway. Reporters have appeared,
           photographing the scene with an increased frenzy. SHAW SR and
           BARKER push their way through the crowd.

                                  SHAW SR
                        That thing killed my son � I want
                        justice!

           CLOSE ON: MADAM PICQUERY as she looks out to the crowd.

                                  SHAW SR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'll expose you for who you are and
                        what you've done.

           GRAVES stands on the platform, continuing to duel with NEWT,
           who stands on the train tracks.

           CREDENCE cowers behind NEWT.

           Finally, almost bored by NEWT'S efforts, GRAVES casts a spell
           that ripples along the train tracks and down the tunnel,
           finally blasting into NEWT, throwing him high into the air.

           NEWT lands on his back and GRAVES immediately sets upon him,
           casting spells in a whip-like motion with increasing vigour.


                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           GRAVES'S immense power is evident, as NEWT writhes on the
           ground, unable to stop him.

           GRAVES continues to whip NEWT, a manic, crazed look in his
           eyes.

           CLOSE ON: CREDENCE, further down the tunnel, sobbing. He
           begins to shake, his face slowly turning black as he tries to
           stop the kinetic mass from rising up within him.

           As NEWT cries out in pain, CREDENCE succumbs to the blackness
           � his body enveloped and overcome � the Obscurus rising up
           and blasting down the tunnel towards GRAVES.

           GRAVES is mesmerised � he falls to his knees beneath the vast
           black mass � pleading in wonder.

                                    GRAVES
                        Credence.

           The Obscurus lets out an unearthly scream and dives towards
           GRAVES, who Disapparates just in time.

           The Obscurus continues to blast around the tunnel.

           GRAVES and NEWT Disapparate and Apparate around the subway
           trying to avoid the Obscurus's path. This causes the station
           to disintegrate even faster.

           Suddenly, the force accelerates, becoming a giant wave that
           consumes the entire space before flying out through the roof.
   
                                                                              118.

           The Obscurus crashes up through the pavement, watched by
           wizards and No-Majs alike. It storms up a half-built
           skyscraper, windows shattering at every level, electric
           wiring exploding, until it reaches the skeletal framework of
           scaffolding above, which buckles perilously.

           Below it, the crowd outside the magical cordon runs for
           cover, terrified.

           The Obscurus forms a wide disc shape before plunging back
           down into the subway.


114        INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT                                                 114

           The Obscurus screams and dives, bursting through the subway
           roof � for a split second, both NEWT and GRAVES seem on the
           point of death as they lie on the tracks, cowering beneath
           this Dark force.

                                 TINA (O.S.)
                       CREDENCE, NO!

           TINA runs onto the tracks.

           Inches from GRAVES'S face, the Obscurus freezes. Slowly, very
           slowly, it rises back up, swirling more gently, staring at
           TINA, who looks straight back into its weird eyes.

                                 TINA (CONT'D)
                       Don't do this � please.

                                  NEWT
                       Keep talking, Tina. Keep talking to
                       him � he'll listen to you. He's
                       listening.

           Inside the Obscurus, CREDENCE reaches out to TINA, the only
           person who has ever done him an uncomplicated kindness. He
           looks at her, desperate and afraid. He has dreamed of her
           ever since she saved him from a beating.

                                 TINA
                       I know what that woman did to
                       you... I know that you've
                       suffered... you need to stop this
                       now... Newt and I will protect
                       you...

           GRAVES is on his feet.


                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                        This man � he is using you.

                                  GRAVES
                        Don't listen to her, Credence. I
                        want you to be free. It's all
                        right.

                             (to CREDENCE, calming
                             him)
                        That's it...

           The Obscurus is beginning to shrink. Its dreadful face is
           becoming more human, more like CREDENCE'S own.

           Suddenly Aurors begin pouring down the steps of the subway
           and into the tunnel.

           More Aurors advance from behind TINA, their wands raised
           aggressively.

                                  TINA (CONT'D)
                        Shhhh! Don't, you'll frighten him.

           The Obscurus lets out a terrible moan and begins to swell
           again. The station is crumbling.

           NEWT and TINA wheel around, arms akimbo, both trying to
           protect CREDENCE.
           GRAVES spins to face the Aurors, wand at the ready.

                                  GRAVES
                        Wands down! Anyone harms him �
                        they'll answer to me-
                             (turning back to
                             CREDENCE)
                        Credence!

                                  TINA
                        Credence...

           The Aurors begin pelting the Obscurus with spells.

                                   GRAVES
                        NO!

           WE SEE CREDENCE from within the black mass, his face
           contorted, screaming. The tirade of spells continues and
           CREDENCE howls in pain.
   
                                                                              120.

           The magical force field surrounding the subway breaks down as
           people continue to flee the scene. Only SHAW SR and LANGDON
           stand steadfast.


116        INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT                                                 116

           Aurors continue to aim spells at the Obscurus, their efforts
           unrelenting and brutal.

           Under this pressure, the Obscurus finally seems to implode �
           a white ball of magical light taking over from the black
           mass.

           The force of the change sends TINA, NEWT and the Aurors
           stumbling backwards.

           All power subsides. Only small tatters of black matter are
           left � floating through the air like feathers.

           NEWT gets to his feet, his face racked with deep-felt grief.
           TINA remains on the floor, crying.

           GRAVES, however, climbs up, back onto the platform, as close
           as possible to the remnants of the black mass.

           The Aurors advance towards GRAVES.

                                 GRAVES
                       You fools. Do you realise what
                       you've done?

           GRAVES seethes as the others watch him with interest. MADAM
           PICQUERY emerges from behind the Aurors, her tone steely,
           questioning.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       The Obscurial was killed on my

                                 GRAVES
                       Yes. And history will surely note
                       that, Madam President.

           GRAVES moves towards her along the platform, his tone
           threatening.

                        He was responsible for the death of

                        law protect? Us?
                             (gesturing vaguely to the
                             No-Majs above)
                        Or them?
                             (smiling bitterly)
                        I refuse to bow down any longer.

           GRAVES walks away from the Aurors.

                                  MADAM PICQUERY
                             (to the Aurors flanking
                             her)
                        Aurors, I'd like you to relieve Mr
                        Graves of his wand and escort him
                        back to--

           As GRAVES moves down the platform a wall of white light
           suddenly appears in front of him, blocking his path.

           GRAVES thinks for a moment � a sneer of derision and
           irritation crossing his face. He turns.

           GRAVES   strides confidently back along the platform, firing
           spells   at both groups of Aurors facing him. Spells fly back
           at him   from all angles, but GRAVES parries them all. Several
           Aurors   are sent flying � GRAVES appears to be winning...

           In a split-second NEWT pulls the cocoon from his pocket and
           releases it at GRAVES. The SWOOPING EVIL soars around him,
           shielding NEWT and the Aurors from GRAVES'S spells, and
           giving NEWT time to raise his wand.




                                                                        (CONTINUED)
   
                                                                              122.

           With a sense that he's been holding this one back, he slashes
           it through the air: OUT FLIES A CRACKLING ROPE OF
           SUPERNATURAL LIGHT that wraps itself around GRAVES like a
           whip.

           GRAVES tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers,
           struggles and falls to his knees, dropping his wand.

                                   TINA
                       Accio.

           GRAVES'S wand flies into TINA'S hand. GRAVES looks around at
           them, a deep hatred in his eyes.

           NEWT and TINA slowly advance, NEWT raising his wand.

                                   NEWT
                       Revelio.

           GRAVES transforms. He is no longer dark, but blond and blue-
           eyed. He is the man on the posters. A murmur spreads through
           the crowd: GRINDELWALD.

           MADAM PICQUERY moves towards him.

                                 GRINDELWALD
                            (with contempt)
                       Do you think you can hold me?

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       We'll do our best, Mr Grindelwald.

           GRINDELWALD stares intently at MADAM PICQUERY, his expression
           of disgust turning into a small, derisory smile. He is forced
           to his feet by two Aurors, who move him towards the entrance.

           As GRINDELWALD reaches NEWT, he pauses � both smiling and
           sneering.

                                 GRINDELWALD
                       Will we die, just a little?

           He is led away up and out of the subway. NEWT watches,
           bemused.

                                                            TIME CUT:

           QUEENIE and JACOB push their way through to the front of the
           Aurors. JACOB holds NEWT'S case.

           QUEENIE hugs TINA. NEWT stares at JACOB.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 JACOB
                       Hey... I figured somebody oughta
                       keep an eye on this thing.

           He hands NEWT his case.

                                  NEWT
                            (humble, completely
                            grateful)
                       Thank you.

           MADAM PICQUERY addresses the group as she stares through the
           broken roof of the subway station, into the world outside.

                                 MADAM PICQUERY
                       We owe you an apology, Mr
                       Scamander. But the magical
                       community is exposed! We cannot
                       Obliviate an entire city.

           A beat as this sinks in.

           As NEWT follows MADAM PICQUERY'S gaze, he sees a tendril of
           black matter, a small part of the Obscurus, floating down
           through the roof. Unnoticed by anyone else, it eventually
           floats up and away, trying to reconnect with its host.

           A pause. NEWT'S attention snaps back to the problem at hand.

                                 NEWT
                       Actually, I think we can.

                                                            TIME CUT:

           NEWT has placed his case wide open underneath the huge hole
           in the subway roof.

           PUSH IN CLOSE ON: NEWT'S open case.

           Suddenly FRANK bursts forth in a flurry of feathers and
           gushes of wind � the crowd of Aurors backs away. The creature
           is beautiful, mesmerising but scary as he flaps his powerful
           wings and hovers above them.

           NEWT moves forward � he examines FRANK, a look of real
           tenderness and pride on his face.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       I was intending to wait until we
                       got to Arizona, but it seems like
                       now you are our only hope, Frank.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           A look between them � an understanding. NEWT reaches out his
           arm and FRANK presses his beak lovingly into the embrace �
           they nuzzle each other affectionately.

           The assembled group watches in awe.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                       I'll miss you, too.

           NEWT steps back, taking the flask of SWOOPING EVIL venom from
           his pocket.

                                 NEWT (CONT'D)
                            (to FRANK)
                       You know what you've got to do.

           NEWT throws the vial high up into the air � FRANK lets out a
           sharp cry, catching it in his beak and immediately soaring
           out of the subway.


117        EXT. NEW YORK - SKY - DAWN                                          117

           No-Majs and Aurors alike shriek and recoil as FRANK bursts
           forth from the subway, gliding into the dawn-lit sky.

           WE FOLLOW FRANK as he rises higher and higher into the air.
           As his wings flap harder, faster, storm clouds congregate.
           Lightning flashes.

           WE SPIRAL UPWARDS as FRANK twists and turns, leaving New York
           lying far below.
           CLOSE ON: FRANK'S beak, the vial clutched tightly and finally
           crushed. The powerful venom spreads through the thick rain,
           enchanting it, thickening it. The darkening sky flashes a
           brilliant blue and rain begins to fall.


118        EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - DAWN                                         118

           HIGH ANGLE: PUSHING DOWN towards the crowd as they look up to
           the sky. As the rain falls and hits them, people move on,
           docile � their bad memories washed away. Each person goes
           about their daily business as though nothing unusual has
           happened.

           Aurors move through the streets, performing repairing charms
           to rebuild the city: buildings and cars are reconstructed and
           streets are returned to normal.

           ANGLE ON: LANGDON, standing in the rain, his expression
           softening, growing blank as the water runs over his face.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)

           ANGLE ON: police looking at their guns, confused � why do
           they have them drawn? They slowly gather themselves, putting
           their weapons away.

           INSIDE A SMALL FAMILY HOME: a young mother looks on fondly at
           her family. As she takes a sip of water, her expression
           becomes blank.

           Groups of Aurors continue to repair the streets, swiftly
           reassembling broken tram tracks, all traces of destruction
           finally disappearing.

           One Auror, passing a newsstand, enchants the papers, removing
           NEWT and TINA'S mugshots and replacing them with banal
           headlines about the weather.

           MR BINGLEY, the bank manager, stands in his bathroom taking a
           shower. As the water trickles over him, he too is Obliviated.
           We see BINGLEY'S wife, brushing her teeth, her expression
           vacant, carefree.

           FRANK continues to soar through the streets of New York,
           churning up more and more rain as he goes, his feathers
           shimmering a brilliant gold. Finally he glides into the
           breaking New York dawn, a magnificent sight.


119        INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAWN                                         119

           As MADAM PICQUERY looks on, the roof of the subway is swiftly
           repaired.

           NEWT addresses the group.

                                  NEWT
                        They won't remember anything. That
                        venom has incredibly powerful
                        Obliviative properties.

                                  MADAM PICQUERY
                             (impressed)
                        We owe you a great debt, Mr
                        Scamander. Now � get that case out
                        of New York.

                                  NEWT
                        Yes, Madam President.

           MADAM PICQUERY begins to walk away, her pack of Aurors moving
           with her. Suddenly she turns back.

           QUEENIE, having read her mind, stands protectively in front
           of JACOB, trying to hide him.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                        Is that No-Maj still here?
                             (on seeing JACOB)
                        Obliviate him. There can be no
                        exceptions.

           MADAM PICQUERY reads the anguish in their faces.

                                  MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry � but even one witness...
                        you know the law.

           A pause. She is uncomfortable at their distress.

                                  MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D)
                        I'll let you say goodbye.

           She leaves.


120        EXT. SUBWAY - DAWN                                                  120

           JACOB leads the others up the steps of the subway, QUEENIE
           following close behind him.

           Rain is still falling heavily, the streets now almost empty
           but for a few hard- working Aurors.

           JACOB has reached the top of the steps and stands, gazing
           into the rain. QUEENIE reaches out and grabs his coat,
           willing him not to move out into the street. JACOB turns to
           her.
                                  JACOB
                        Hey. Hey, this is for the best.
                             (off their looks)
                        Yeah � I was � I was never even
                        supposed to be here.

           JACOB fights back tears. QUEENIE gazes up at him, her
           beautiful face full of distress.

           TINA and NEWT, too, look incredibly sad.

                                  JACOB (CONT'D)
                        I was never supposed to know any of
                        this. Everybody knows Newt only
                        kept me around because � hey �
                        Newt, why did you keep me around?

           NEWT has to be explicit. It doesn't come easily.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                  NEWT
                        Because I like you. Because you're
                        my friend and I'll never forget how
                        you helped me, Jacob.

           A beat.

           JACOB is overcome with emotion at NEWT'S answer.

                                   JACOB
                        Oh!

           QUEENIE moves forwards up the stairs towards JACOB � they
           stand close.

                                  QUEENIE
                             (trying to cheer him up)
                        I'll come with you. We'll go
                        somewhere � we'll go anywhere � see
                        I ain't never gonna find anyone
                        like--


                                  JACOB
                             (bravely)
                        There's loads like me.

                                   QUEENIE
                        No...   no... there's only one like
                        you.

           The pain is almost unbearable.

                                  JACOB
                             (a beat)
                        I gotta go.

           JACOB turns to face the rain, and wipes his eyes.

                                  NEWT
                             (starting after him)
                        JACOB!

                                  JACOB
                             (trying to smile)
                        It's okay... it's okay... it's
                        okay. It's just like waking up,
                        right?

           The group smiles back at him, encouraging, trying to soothe
           the situation.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)
   
                                                                              128.
120        CONTINUED: (2)                                                      120
           Looking at their faces as he moves, JACOB walks backwards
           into the rain. Turning his face to the sky, arms out, he
           allows the water to wash over him completely.

           QUEENIE creates a magical umbrella with her wand and steps
           out towards JACOB. She moves in closely, tenderly stroking
           JACOB'S face before closing her eyes and bending in to gently
           kiss him.

           Finally she pulls slowly away, her gaze not leaving JACOB'S
           face even for a second. Then, suddenly, she's gone, leaving
           JACOB standing, arms out, longingly embracing no one.

           CLOSE ON: JACOB'S face as he fully 'WAKES UP', blank-faced
           and confused by his location and the torrential downpour he's
           standing in. He finally moves off through the streets � a
           lonely figure.


121        EXT. JACOB'S CANNING FACTORY - A WEEK LATER - EARLY EVENING
                                                                    121

           An exhausted JACOB, surrounded by a crowd of similarly
           overalled production- line workers, is leaving after a hard
           day's shift. He carries a battered leather case.

           A man walks towards him -- NEWT. They collide and JACOB'S
           case is knocked to the ground.

                                 NEWT
                       So sorry - sorry!

           NEWT has moved swiftly and purposefully onwards.

                                   JACOB
                              (no recognition)
                       Hey!

           JACOB bends   to pick up his case and looks down, puzzled. His
           old case is   suddenly very heavy. One of the catches flicks
           open of its   own accord. JACOB smiles a little, and bends down
           to open the   case.

           Inside, the case is filled with solid silver Occamy
           eggshells, a note attached. As JACOB reads, we hear:

                                 NEWT (V.O.)
                       'Dear Mr Kowalski, You are wasted
                       in a canning factory. Please take
                       these Occamy eggshells as
                       collateral for your bakery. A well-
                       wisher.'
   
                                                                              129.


122        EXT. NEW YORK HARBOUR - NEXT DAY                                    122

           CLOSE ON: NEWT'S feet as he walks through the crowd.

           NEWT is preparing to leave New York, overcoat on, Hufflepuff
           scarf around his neck, case tied up tightly with string.

           TINA walks alongside him. They stop before the boarding gate.
           TINA looks anxious.

                                 NEWT
                            (smiling)
                       Well it's been...

                                    TINA
                       Hasn't it!

           Pause. NEWT looks up, TINA'S expression is expectant.

                                 TINA (CONT'D)
                       Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank
                       you.

                                 NEWT
                       What on earth for?

                                 TINA
                       Well, you know, if you hadn't said
                       all those nice things to Madam
                       Picquery about me � I wouldn't be
                       back on the investigative team now.
                                 NEWT
                       Well � I can't think of anyone that
                       I'd rather have investigating me.

           Not precisely what he was aiming for, but too late now...
           NEWT becomes slightly awkward, TINA shyly appreciative.

                                  TINA
                       Well try not to need investigating
                       for a bit.

                                 NEWT
                       I will. Quiet life for me from now
                       on... back to the Ministry...
                       deliver my manuscript...

                                 TINA
                       I'll look out for it. Fantastic
                       Beasts and Where to Find Them.

           Weak smiles. A pause. TINA plucks up courage.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)

122        CONTINUED:                                                          122
                                  TINA (CONT'D)
                        Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

                                   NEWT
                        Who?

                                  TINA
                        The girl whose picture you carry-

                                  NEWT
                        I don't really know what Leta likes
                        these days because people change.

                                   TINA
                        Yes.

                                  NEWT
                             (a dawning realisation)
                        I've changed. I think. Maybe a
                        little.

           TINA is delighted, but doesn't know how to express it.
           Instead, she's trying not to cry.

           The ship's siren sounds � most of the other passengers have
           now boarded.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                        I'll send you a copy of my book, if
                        I may.

                                  TINA
                        I'd like that.

           NEWT gazes at TINA � awkwardly affectionate. He gently
           reaches forward and touches her hair. Lingering for a moment,
           they stare into each other's eyes.

           A last look and NEWT suddenly moves away, leaving TINA
           standing, raising a hand to touch where NEWT stroked her
           hair.

           But then he's back.

                                  NEWT
                        I'm so sorry � how would you feel
                        if I gave you your copy in person?

           A radiant smile breaks across TINA'S face.

                                  TINA
                        I'd like that � very much.


                                                                        (CONTINUED)
   
                                                                              131.

           NEWT can't help but grin back at her before turning and
           walking away.

           He pauses on the gangplank, perhaps unsure of how to act, but
           eventually moves on without looking back.

           TINA stands alone in the empty harbour. As she walks away,
           there's a playful skip to her step.


123        EXT. JACOB'S BAKERY, LOWER EAST SIDE - THREE MONTHS LATER 123
                                                                      -
           DAY

           WIDE SHOT: a bustling New York street � market stalls line
           the street, which heaves with busy people, horses and
           carriages.

           ANGLE ON: a small, inviting bakery. Crowds throng outside the
           pretty little shop, painted with the name 'KOWALSKI'.

           People peer with interest into the shop's windows, and happy
           customers leave, their arms laden with baked goods.


124        INT. JACOB'S BAKERY, LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY                          124

           CLOSE ON: the doorbell as it rings to signal the entrance of
           a new customer.

           CLOSE ON: the pastries and breads on the counter, all moulded
           into fanciful little shapes � we recognise the Demiguise,
           Niffler and Erumpent among them.

           JACOB, serving, is very happy, his shop full to bursting with
           customers.

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                            (examining the little
                            pastries)
                       Where do you get your ideas from,
                       Mr Kowalski?

                                  JACOB
                       I don't know, I don't know � they
                       just come!

           He hands the lady her pastries.

                                 JACOB (CONT'D)
                       Here you go � don't forget this �
                       enjoy.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)
   
                                                                              132.

           JACOB turns and calls over one of his bakery assistants,
           handing him a pair of keys.

                                  JACOB (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Henry � storage, all right?
                        Thanks, pal.
           The bell tinkles again.

           JACOB looks up and is thunderstruck all over again: it's
           QUEENIE.

           They stare at each other � QUEENIE beams, radiant. JACOB,
           quizzical and totally enchanted, touches his neck � a flicker
           of memory. He smiles back.
