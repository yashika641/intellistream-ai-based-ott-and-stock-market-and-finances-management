                                                                      1.


      Over black.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  Long ago, the world was full of
                  wonder!


      EXT. FANTASY LANDSCAPE - DAY

      We race over rolling green hills. A unicorn soars into view,
      whinnies, and banks off into the sky.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  It was adventurous...

      The land below is alive with FANTASY CREATURES. We pass
      through a field of racing CENTAURS.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  Exciting...

      Mermaids leap through shimming water and FAIRIES fly through
      the air, spiraling up into the sky.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  And best of all... there was MAGIC!

      We stop on an ELF WIZARD holding a gnarled wooden staff. He
      turns and thrusts his staff toward the sky, casting a spell.

                            ELF WIZARD
                  Boombastia!

      Fireworks shoot magically into the air. Fantasy creatures
      across the land watch in awe.


      EXT. CLIFF - DAY

      A small group of creatures huddle and shiver in the cold.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  And that magic helped all in need.

      A SATYR WIZARD approaches.

                            SATYR WIZARD
                  Flame Infernar!

      A fire appears and they happily warm themselves by it.




 
                                                                       2.


      INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT

      A warrior, rogue, and wizard try to reach a glowing chalice.
      A dragon breathes FIRE at them. The warrior holds up a
      shield, protecting them from the flame.

      The BRAVE WIZARD leaps out and casts a spell.

                            BRAVE WIZARD
                  Voltar Thundasir!

      A lighting bolt zaps the ceiling, crashing rocks down in
      front of the dragon, clearing their path to the chalice.


      EXT. MUSHROOM VILLAGE - DUSK

      A wizard teaches a young apprentice to conjure a glowing orb.
      She floats the orb into a mushroom house, filling it with
      light. The gnome resident of the house emerges, delighted.

      The apprentice attempts the spell, but only manages to catch
      his robe on FIRE. The wizard quickly puts out the flames and
      encourages the apprentice to try again.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  But it wasn't easy to master. And
                  so the world found a simpler way to
                  get by...

      The wizard and apprentice see a satyr INVENTOR in a barn
      surrounded by fantasy creatures.

                            INVENTOR
                  I call it: the light bulb!

      The inventor flips a switch and the lightbulb turns on,
      illuminating the room. The crowd is amazed.

      The apprentice hands the wizard the magical staff, walks
      toward the crowd, and gives the light bulb a try.

                            APPRENTICE
                  `Tis so easy!

      The wizard looks on, disappointed.

                              MASTER WIZARD
                  Huh.

      An elf on a sales floor lights up a gas stove with a click,
      click. Everyone reacts in amazement.




 
                                                                       3.


      Goblins sit in a cozy living room. One of them turns on a gas
      fireplace using a remote.

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  Over time, magic faded away...

      A centaur plays "Prance Prance Revolution" in an arcade.

      A mermaid lounges in a kiddie pool, scrolling on her phone.

      A sprite, suitcase in hand, approaches an awaiting airplane.

      A factory assembly line rolls by.

      Traffic crawls along a congested highway.


      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

      A troll on a bicycle tosses papers onto doorsteps of mushroom
      houses with satellite dishes, garages, basketball hoops, etc.

      A feral unicorn roots around in a trash can. Another unicorn
      approaches and hisses. The first unicorn chases it off.

      We push into the upstairs window of a mushroom house.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - IAN'S ROOM - MORNING

                            DAD (V.O.)
                  But I hope there's a little magic
                  left...

      A phone alarm beeps. A boy's hand quickly silences it. Puts
      on his watch with style. His shoes with flair.

                               DAD (V.O.)
                  ...in you.

      He pulls on his sweatshirt and gets stuck. He pulls harder
      until his big nose, wild hair, and giant ears pop out of the
      sweatshirt, revealing a lanky teenage elf: IAN LIGHTFOOT.

      Ian smiles and dusts off the "Willowdale College" sweatshirt.
      He grabs his backpack and pauses to look at his desk
      calendar. Today is circled and reads: 16TH BDAY.

      Ian looks into the mirror, smiles, and walks out of the room.

      TITLE: ONWARD




 
                                                                       4.


      EXT. MUSHROOM NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

      Ian walks downstairs to the beat of loud, pulsing music.

      LAUREL LIGHTFOOT, a female elf in her 40s, works out in front
      of the TV. An onscreen FITNESS INSTRUCTOR barks commands.

                            FITNESS INSTRUCTOR
                  We're gonna get Warrior Z90 fit!
                  Let me hear you say I'm a mighty
                  warrior!

                            FITNESS MODELS
                  I'm a mighty warrior!

                            LAUREL
                  I'm a mighty warrior!

                            IAN
                  Morning, Mom!

      A scaly Labrador-sized dragon, BLAZEY, races into the room
      and tackles Ian to the ground.

                              IAN
                  Aahh!

      Ian is trapped as the dragon happily licks his face.

                            IAN
                  Shh! Down girl! Please!

                            LAUREL
                       (noticing)
                  Oh--! Blazey, down!

      Laurel races over, squirting the dragon with a spray bottle.

                            IAN
                  Ah! Stop, girl, stop!

                            LAUREL
                  Bad dragon! Back to your lair!

      Blazey blows a small puff of fire at Laurel and runs off. Ian
      stands and is attacked with Mom kisses.

                            LAUREL
                  Happy Birthday, mister adult man!


                            IAN
                       (struggling/laughing)
                  Ugh, no, Mom! Ah! gross.


 
                                                                 5.


                            LAUREL
                  Hey, buddy, don't wipe off my
                  kisses!

      Laurel looks at Ian, touched.

                              IAN
                  What?

                            LAUREL
                  You're wearing your Dad's
                  sweatshirt.

                            IAN
                  Oh, you know. Finally fits.

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, my little chubby cheeks is all
                  grown up!

                            IAN
                  Okay, okay, Mom! I gotta eat
                  something before school.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Ian looks in the fridge for breakfast.

                            LAUREL
                  Ugh, we don't have much food. I
                  still have to go to the grocery
                  store--

      Laurel smacks Ian's hand as he reaches for something.

                            LAUREL
                  Hands off, Mister! Those are for
                  your party tonight.

      Ian takes the milk from the fridge and closes the door.

                            IAN
                  It's not a party Mom, it just us.

      Ian empties the last of a box of cereal into a bowl.

                            LAUREL
                  Well, you could invite those kids
                  from your science class. You said
                  they seemed pretty "rockin'."




 
                                                                      6.


                            IAN
                  I'm pretty sure I didn't say it
                  like that. And besides, I don't
                  even know them.

                            LAUREL
                  Well, your birthday is a day to try
                  new things, be the "new you"!

      Laurel makes herself a smoothie, yelling over the blender.

                            LAUREL
                  SPEAKING OF TRYING NEW THINGS, DID
                  YOU SIGN UP FOR DRIVING PRACTICE?!

      The blender stops, but Ian is still shouting.

                               IAN
                  NO!
                          (quieter)
                  No.

      Laurel pours her shake into a glass.

                            LAUREL
                  I know you're a little scared to
                  drive sweetie-pie, but--

                            IAN
                  I'm not scared, Mom.
                       (pointing offscreen)
                  I'm gonna move Barley's game.

                            LAUREL
                  Okay, but you know how he gets when
                  someone touches that board.

      Ian walks to the kitchen table, stumbling over a plastic
      flail on the floor. The table is covered with a game: pewter
      figures, dice, and miniatures. Ian and begins to move them--

                            IAN
                  Well, he's gotta learn how to clean
                  up his toys--

      --when suddenly a huge, thick arm wraps around his neck.

                               BARLEY (O.S.)
                  HALT!

                               IAN
                  AHH!




 
                                                                       7.


      Ian is pulled into the hulking barrel chest of twenty-year-
      old BARLEY LIGHTFOOT.

                            BARLEY
                  Doth my brother dare disrupt an
                  active campaign?!

      Ian's cereal bowl is knocked to the floor in the scuffle.

                            IAN
                  Oh, come on!

                            BARLEY
                  You know, Ian, in the days of old,
                  a boy of sixteen would have his
                  strength tested in the Swamps of
                  Despair.

                            IAN
                  I'm not testing anything, just let
                  me go!

                            LAUREL
                  Let him go.

      Barley releases Ian.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, but I know you're stronger
                  than that. There's a mighty warrior
                  inside you. You just have to let
                  him out. Riiight, Mom?

      Barley puts Laurel in the same chokehold as she laughs.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! That's good! Keepin' your head
                  down.

                            LAUREL
                       (laughing)
                  Barley, you stink! When was the
                  last time you showered?

      Blazey roars and leaps around. Amidst the chaos, Ian picks up
      his bowl from the floor and retreats to the kitchen counter.

                            BARLEY
                  If you tried a little harder, you
                  actually could probably wiggle out
                  of this--

      Suddenly, Laurel flips Barley onto his back with a CRASH.



 
                                                                      8.


                            BARLEY
                  See? Mom knows how to let out her
                  inner warrior.

      Barley reaches up to high-five Laurel.

                            LAUREL
                  Thank you. Now take out the trash.


      EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - CONTINUOUS

      As Barley opens the back door, trash in hand, we hear a
      police radio.

                            OFFICER GORE (O.S.)
                       (fuzzy, over radio)
                  --stay on the lookout for a runaway
                  Griffin.

                            BARLEY
                       (groan)
                  Officer Bronco.

      OFFICER COLT BRONCO, a mustachioed, cocky cop with mirrored
      aviator sunglasses, speaks over the clop of horse hooves.

                            COLT
                  Barley, Barley, Barley. Every time
                  the city tries to tear down an old
                  piece of rubble, I gotta drag my
                  rear end out here and deal with
                  you.

      As he steps closer, we see he's not a mounted police officer
      after all. He's a centaur cop.

                            BARLEY
                  I don't know what you're talking
                  about.

      Laurel appears in the doorway behind Barley, irritated.

                            COLT
                  Oh, really?

      Colt pulls out his phone. A video shows Barley chained to an
      ancient fountain in front of a laughing crowd of people.

                            BARLEY
                  I will not let you tear this down
                  this fountain! Ancient warriors on
                  grand quests drank from it's
                  flowing waters!


 
                                                                      9.


      As construction workers pull him away, Barley falls into the
      water with a SPLASH.

                              LAUREL
                  Barley.

                            BARLEY
                  They're destroying the town's past!

                            COLT
                  And last night, someone destroyed
                  their bulldozer.

                            LAUREL
                  Ugh, well come on in, rest your
                  haunches for a minute.

                            COLT
                  Thank you, hon.

      Laurel and Colt kiss. Ian and Barley shudder in disgust.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

      Colt approaches Ian in the kitchen.

                            COLT
                  Hey there, Birthday Boy... So ya
                  workin' hard or hardly workin'?
                       (horse laugh)

      Colt punches Ian on the shoulder just a little too hard.

                            IAN
                  I'm just, you know... making a
                  toast.

                            LAUREL
                  I'm serious, Barley, you need to
                  start thinking less about the past
                  and more about your future.

                            COLT
                  She's right.

      As Colt turns, his tail knocks Ian's toast off the counter.
      It falls to the floor and is promptly snatched up by Blazey.

                            COLT
                  You can't spend all day playing
                  your board game.




 
                                                                          10.


      Colt awkwardly plops his hindquarters into a chair at the
      table, toppling Quests of Yore pieces. Barley hustles over to
      set the pieces straight.

                            BARLEY
                  Uh, Quests of Yore isn't just a
                  board game, it's an historically-
                  based role playing scenario. Did
                  you know in the old days centaurs
                  could run seventy miles an hour?

                            COLT
                  I own a vehicle, don't need to run.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, Ian, you could definitely
                  learn a lot from Quests of Yore.
                  You want to play?

                              IAN
                  I don't.

      Ian folds the last piece of toast and starts to take a bite--

                            BARLEY
                  You could be a crafty rogue, or...
                  ooh, I know! You can be a wizard.

      Barley puts the pewter wizard figure on Ian's shoulder.

                            BARLEY
                       (wizard voice)
                  I shall cast a spell on thee!!

                            IAN
                  Hey, careful of Dad's sweatshirt.

                            BARLEY
                  I don't even remember Dad wearing
                  that sweatshirt.

                            IAN
                  Well, you do only have, like, two
                  memories of him.

                            BARLEY
                  No! I've got three. I remember his
                  beard was scratchy, he had a goofy
                  laugh, and I used to play--

                 BARLEY                                 IAN
      --drums on his feet.                 --drums on his feet. Right.




 
                                                                      11.


                            BARLEY
                  I used to go...

      Barley hums "Shave and a Haircut" with raspberries for the
      last two beat, but clumsily knocks Ian's toast off the
      counter. Ian lunges for it, but Barley gets it first.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoops! Five second rule.

      As Barley puts the toast back on the plate, his wrist cuff
      snags on Ian's sweatshirt, ripping it. Ian GASPS.

                            BARLEY
                  It's okay! You just gotta pull it!

      Barley yanks his arm to snap the snagged thread, but only
      rips the seam even more.

                              IAN
                  NO!

                              LAUREL
                  Barley!

      Laurel cuts the thread. Ian walks away, trying to stay calm.

                            IAN
                  You know what, I'm just gonna get
                  some food on the way to school.

                            LAUREL
                  I'll sew that later tonight, okay?

      Barley jumps up, puts on a helmet, and grabs a sword.

                            BARLEY
                  Wait, wait, wait, wait! By the Laws
                  of Yore, I must dub thee a man
                  today! Kneel before me.

                            IAN
                  Oh, that's okay... I gotta get
                  going!

                            BARLEY
                  Alright, well I'll pick you up
                  later and we'll perform the
                  ceremony at school!

                            IAN
                  NO! No, no, no, no, no. Don't do
                  that. Okay, bye!



 
                                                                     12.


      Ian closes the door behind him and lets out a massive SIGH.


      EXT. BURGERSHIRE RESTAURANT - DAY

      People come and go from a typical fast food restaurant.


      INT. BURGERSHIRE RESTAURANT - DAY

      A cash register runs up an order.

      Ian takes his receipt and sits. An elf dad in his forties,
      GAXTON, and his preteen son sit on the bench next to Ian.

                            GAXTON
                  Hey! Go Griffins!

                              IAN
                  What?

      Gaxton points to Ian's hoodie.

                            GAXTON
                  You go to Willowdale College?

      Gaxton's son goes to the counter to wait for their food.

                            IAN
                  Oh, no. This was my Dad's.

      Ian points to the name LIGHTFOOT on the hoodie.

                            GAXTON
                  "Lightfoot?" Wilden Lightfoot?

      Ian lights up.

                              IAN
                  Yeah!

                            GAXTON
                  You're kidding! I went to college
                  with him!

                              IAN
                  Really?

                              GAXTON
                  Yeah!
                       (beat)
                  Boy, I was so sorry to hear that he
                  passed away.



 
                                                         13.


      Ian nods and smiles.

                            IAN
                  Yeah... thanks.

                            GAXTON
                  You know, your dad was a great guy!
                  So confident. When he came into a
                  room, people noticed.
                       (laughing at the memory)
                  The man wore the ugliest purple
                  socks, every single day.

                             IAN
                       (laugh)
                  What? Why?

                            GAXTON
                  Hey, that's exactly what we asked.
                  But he was just bold. I always
                  wished I had a little bit of that
                  in me.

                             IAN
                  Yeah. Wow.
                       (beat)
                  I've never heard any of this about
                  him before. Do you remember--?

      GAXTON'S SON calls out, waving a bag of food.

                               GAXTON'S SON
                  Dad!

                             GAXTON
                  Oh! Sorry. Gotta get this guy off
                  to school.

      Gaxton holds out his hand to shake Ian's.

                            GAXTON
                  Hey, it was nice meeting you!

                            IAN
                  Yeah, you too.

      Ian thinks to himself for a beat.

                               IAN
                  Huh. Bold.




 
                                                                       14.


      EXT. NEW MUSHROOMTON HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

      Ian sits outside the school, making a list called "NEW ME."

                  SPEAK UP MORE
                  LEARN TO DRIVE
                  INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTY

      He thinks to himself for a moment and then adds a final item:

                  BE LIKE DAD

      The bell rings and he heads into the imposing building.


      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      Ian walks into his classroom.

                            TEACHER
                  Okay, class, sit down. We're
                  starting roll.

      GORGAMON, a slobby, flip-flop-wearing troll, has his feet on
      Ian's chair.

                            IAN
                  Hey, uh, Gorgamon... um, would you
                  mind not putting your feet on my
                  chair today?

                            GORGAMON
                  Sorry dude, gotta keep 'em
                  elevated. Gets the blood flowing to
                  my brain.

                            IAN
                  It just makes it a little hard for
                  me to fit in there--

                            GORGAMON
                  Well if I don't have good blood
                  flow, I can't concentrate on my
                  school work. You don't want me to
                  do bad school, do you?

                              IAN
                  Uh... no.

                            GORGAMON
                  Thanks, bro.

      Ian sits, scooting up to make room for the gross feet.



 
                                                                    15.


      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

      A GOBLIN TEACHER stands next to a student driver car.

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  First road test, any volunteers?

      A single hand raises from the back of a group of students.
      The crowd parts to reveal a nervous Ian.


      INT. DRIVER'S ED CAR - DAY

      Ian drives. The Driving Instructor sits in the passenger
      seat. Two other kids are in the backseat.

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  A left here.

      Ian signals and turns.

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  Now take this on-ramp to the
                  freeway.

                             IAN
                        (lacking confidence)
                  Okay, yeah. I'm super ready for
                  that.

      Ian's smile fades as he nears the ZOOMING freeway traffic.

                            IAN
                       (unconvincing)
                  It's nice and fast.

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  Just merge into traffic.

                            IAN
                  Yup, just any minute...

      He grows more nervous.

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  Merge into traffic!

                              IAN
                  Uh...

                            DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  MERGE INTO TRAFFIC!




 
                                                                      16.


      Panicked, Ian tries to merge. A car lays on its horn and Ian
      retreats back into his lane.

                            IAN
                  I'm not ready!

                               DRIVING INSTRUCTOR
                  Pull over.

      Ian pulls the car off the freeway.


      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

      Students are hanging out in front of the school, including
      four friendly TEENS: SADALIA, GURGE, PARTHENOPE, and ALTHEA.

                            SADALIA
                  Alright, so what should we do this
                  weekend?

                            GURGE
                  Move to a cooler town?

      We see Ian nearby, alone, rehearsing some lines to himself.

                            IAN
                  Oh, hey! What's up, dudes? I'm, uh,
                  having a party tonight, and was
                  wondering if you wanted to come
                  over and get down on some cake...

      Ian's smile drops. Ian checks the writing on his hand.

                            IAN
                  That's not something anyone says.
                  Okay, don't say dudes. ...Gang?
                  "What's up, gang?"

      He crosses out "dudes" and changes it to "gang."

                            IAN
                  What's up, gang?!

      Ian nods, then nervously heads over to the TEENS.

                            IAN
                  Hey, what's up, gang?

      The teens turn to Ian.

                            SADALIA
                  Oh, hey... Ian, right?



 
                                                                       17.


                            IAN
                       (surprised)
                  Oh, I didn't know you knew my...

      Ian looks at his hand. The writing is smeared and sweaty.

                            IAN
                  Uhhh, anyway... if you like
                  parties, then I was gonna do a
                  party.

                              SADALIA
                  What?

                            IAN
                  What I was trying to say, is if
                  you're not doing anything tonight--
                  but I'm sure you probably are doing
                  something tonight--and you like
                  cake like I like cake, I've got a
                  cake... at my house.

      The teens look at each other.

                            SADALIA
                  Are you inviting us to a party?

                            IAN
                  That's the one.

                            SADALIA
                  Oh, yeah! We don't have any plans.

      The others all agree. Ian looks up, surprised.

                            IAN
                  Really? I guess we can just take
                  the bus over to my house--

      Ian is suddenly distracted by metal music in the near
      distance, a hard-working engine, a backfire. The teens look
      over as a disaster of a van pulls up, its side painted with a
      rearing Pegasus surrounded by lightning bolts.

                            IAN
                  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

      It's Barley. He spots Ian and sticks his head out the window.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! Is that the birthday boy I
                  see?!




 
                                                                       18.


      Ian cringes. The van swerves into the school pickup area, and
      comes to a stop halfway up onto the curb. Barley steps out,
      in full fantasy garb, and gestures grandly.

                            BARLEY
                  Behold! Your chariot awaits!

      The group looks at Ian. Ian keeps his back turned to the van.

                            ALTHEA
                  Do you know that guy?

                              IAN
                  Uh...

                            BARLEY
                  Sir Iandore of Lightfoot!

                            ALTHEA
                  Seems like he's talking to you.

                              BARLEY
                  HEY, IAN!

      Barley honks the horn. Ian turns around sheepishly.

                            IAN
                  Hey, Barley... Yeah, we're actually
                  gonna take the bus...

                             BARLEY
                  The bus?! Nay! I will give you and
                  your companions transport upon
                  Guinevere!

                            PARTHENOPE
                  Um, who's Guinevere?

                            BARLEY
                  My mighty steed!

      Barley slaps the hood of the van. The bumper falls off.

                            BARLEY
                  Oops, that's embarrassing! That's
                  okay, girl. We'll patch you back
                  up.

      Barley bends to reattach the bumper with duct tape, revealing
      his butt crack. Ian puts his hand to his face, embarrassed.




 
                                                                     19.


                            IAN
                  Ugh...
                       (to teens)
                  He's just joking around.

      Ian removes his hand to reveal the ink from his palm is now
      on his face.

                            SADALIA
                  You've got something on your face.

      Ian wipes his cheek, smearing ink there.

                            SADALIA
                  Oh no, you just--oh! Right.

      Ian wipes the other side spreading more ink around.

                            SADALIA
                  No, it's--nope.

      Ian looks at his hand, then panics.

                            IAN
                  Oh! Uh... You know what? I just
                  remembered that my birthday is,
                  uh... cancelled.

                              ALTHEA
                  What?

                            IAN
                  I mean, the party. It was never
                  actually happening. It was just
                  this huge misunderstanding, so I
                  gotta go. Okay, Bye!

      Ian races into Barley's van.


      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

      A pile of parking tickets clutter the passenger seat.

                            BARLEY
                  Ooh, whoops! Sorry! Let me just
                  file those.

      Barley shoves the parking tickets into the glovebox, then
      notices the smeared letters on Ian's forehead.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey! Did those kids write on your
                  face?


 
                                                                       20.


      Barley licks his thumb and starts to rub Ian's forehead.

                             BARLEY
                   Here, I'll get it.

      Ian pushes Barley's hand away.

                             IAN
                   Can we please just go home?

                             BARLEY
                   Okay, we'll perform your birthday
                   ceremony later. Then you'll be
                   ready for adulthood and it's
                   gauntlet of challenges! You know in
                   ancient times, you celebrated your
                   day of birth with a solemn quest.

      Ian looks at the cartoon dragon on the side of the gym,
      giving an exaggerated thumbs up. Ian slumps in his seat.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - DAY

      Ian enters the house, defeated.

                              IAN
                   Mom?

      No answer.


      INT. IAN'S ROOM - EVENING

      Ian sits at his desk, looks at his "NEW ME" list, and crosses
      off SPEAK UP MORE, LEARN TO DRIVE, INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTY. He
      pauses, then crosses off the last item: BE LIKE DAD.

      Ian crumples the list and throws it in his waste basket.

      He leans back in his chair and looks at the photos on his
      bulletin board.

      A photo of WILDEN LIGHTFOOT, Ian's Dad, with three-year-old
      Barley and pregnant Laurel.

      A photo of Laurel, toddler Barley, and baby Ian. No Dad.

      Ian opens his drawer and pulls out a tape labeled: DAD. He
      puts it into a stereo on his desk and presses play. We hear
      timeworn audio of a man and woman in conversation.




 
                                                                      21.


                            LAUREL
                  Will, you're not gonna get that
                  thing working.

                            DAD
                  I think I've got it.

                            LAUREL
                  I'm gonna watch from over here when
                  it blows up.

      Laurel moves out of range of the microphone. We only hear
      Dad, then pauses for Laurel's distant, indecipherable words.

                            DAD
                       (into mic)
                  Hello? Hello?

                            LAUREL
                  I'll bet good money you can't get
                  it to work.

                            DAD
                  Oh, is that right?

                            LAUREL
                  Yup. But you're doing a good job of
                  making it look like you know what
                  you're doing.

                            DAD
                  Well, I'm trying to.
                       (laugh)

                            LAUREL
                  Did you check if it had batteries?

                             DAD
                        (laugh)

                            LAUREL
                  No, I'm serious.

                              DAD
                  I know.

                            LAUREL
                  So, is it really working?

                             DAD
                  Well, let's find out.
                       (beat)
                  Okay. Bye.



 
                                                                       22.


      Ian smiles, rewinds the tape, and plays it again.

                            LAUREL
                  Will, you're not gonna get that
                  thing working.

                            DAD
                  I think I've got it.

                            LAUREL
                  I'm gonna watch from over here when
                  it blows up.

                              IAN
                  Hi, Dad.

      We see close-ups of the pictures on the bulletin board as Ian
      begins to talk over the tape, forming a conversation.

                            DAD
                  Hello? Hello?

                            IAN
                  It's me, Ian.

                            DAD
                  Oh, is that right?

                            IAN
                  Yeah. Did you have a good day?

                            DAD
                  Well, I'm trying to.

                            IAN
                  Yeah, me too. Although, I could
                  clearly use some help.

                             DAD
                        (laugh)

                            IAN
                  I sure do wish I could spend a day
                  with you sometime.

                              DAD
                  I know.

                            IAN
                  Yeah, there's so many things we
                  could do, I bet it'd be really fun!

                            DAD
                  Well, let's find out.


 
                                                                      23.


                            IAN
                  Yeah, I mean, I'd love to! We
                  could, uh--

                               DAD
                  Okay. Bye.

                            IAN
                  Yeah... Bye.

      The tape stops. Ian sits back, deflated.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Laurel steps on a pewter warrior figure on the ground.

                               LAUREL
                  AH! MY--!

      She opens the basement door and calls to Barley over the din
      of his music.

                            LAUREL
                  Barley, keep your soldiers off my
                  land or our kingdoms will go to
                  war!

                            BARLEY (O.S.)
                  Sorry, Mom!

                            LAUREL
                  Ugh, this is the world's longest
                  gap year.

      Laurel sees Ian on the couch, sewing his sweater.

                            LAUREL
                  Honey, I was gonna do that.

                            IAN
                  That's okay.

      Laurel watches him.

                            LAUREL
                  Wow, you must have been taught by
                  some kind of sewing master.

                            IAN
                  Yeah, a very humble sewing master.

      Ian finishes sewing. He holds out the thread and Laurel cuts
      it with the scissors. They've clearly done this a lot.


 
                                                                      24.


      Ian rubs his fingers over the word stitched on the breast of
      the hoodie: "LIGHTFOOT."

                            IAN
                  What was Dad like when he was my
                  age? Was he always super confident?

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, no. It took him a while to find
                  out who he was.

                            IAN
                  I wish I'd met him.

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, me too. But hey, you know, when
                  your dad got sick, he fought so
                  hard... because he wanted to meet
                  you more than anything.

      Laurel watches Ian, heartbroken.

                            LAUREL
                  You know what, I have something for
                  you. I was going to wait until
                  after cake but... I think you've
                  waited long enough.

                            IAN
                  What is it?

                            LAUREL
                  It's a gift... from your dad.


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Laurel pulls down the attic ladder and climbs into the
      darkness. Ian comes up the stairs with Barley.

                            BARLEY
                  What do you mean it's from Dad?

                            IAN
                  I don't know! Mom said it was for
                  both of us.

                            BARLEY
                  What is it?!

      Laurel descends the ladder with a long, canvas-wrapped item.




 
                                                                      25.


                            LAUREL
                  He just said to give you this when
                  you were both over sixteen. I have
                  no idea what it is.


      INT. IAN'S ROOM - DAY

      Ian and Barley set the gift on Ian's bed. Ian pulls back the
      cloth to reveal a long, skinny, gnarled piece of wood.

                              BARLEY
                  NO WAY!

      Barley picks it up in amazement.

                            BARLEY
                  It's a wizard staff! DAD WAS A
                  WIZARD!

                              IAN
                  What?

                            LAUREL
                  Hold on, your Dad was an
                  accountant. I mean, he got
                  interested in a lot of strange
                  things when he got sick but--

      Laurel and Ian are confused. Ian looks back under the cloth
      and sees a rolled up piece of parchment.

                              IAN
                  There's a letter.
                         (reading)
                  "Dear Ian and Barley: Long ago, the
                  world was full of wonder! It was
                  adventurous, exciting, and best of
                  all... there was magic. And that
                  magic helped all in need. But it
                  wasn't easy to master. And so the
                  world found a simpler way to get
                  by. Over time, magic faded away,
                  but I hope there's a little magic
                  left... in you. And so I wrote this
                  spell so I could see for myself,
                  who my boys grew up to be."

      Ian looks at the second page of the letter.

                            IAN
                  Visitation Spell?




 
                                                                      26.


      Barley takes the page from Ian and examines it. It reads
      VISITATION SPELL and has a diagram of a wizard staff with a
      beam of light shooting from it, forming a person.

                            BARLEY
                  I don't believe this.
                       (excited)
                  This spell brings him back. For one
                  whole day, Dad will be back!

                              LAUREL
                  What?

                            IAN
                  Back?! Like back to life? That's
                  not possible.

                            BARLEY
                       (holding up staff)
                  It is with this.

                            IAN
                  I'm gonna meet Dad?

      Laurel grabs the letter from the boys. She's beside herself.

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, Will, you wonderful nut, what
                  is this?!

      Barley digs through the cloth.

                            BARLEY
                  Now, a spell this powerful needs an
                  assist element. For this to work
                  Dad would've had to find a...
                       (finding gem)
                  Phoenix Gem!

      Barley pulls out an orange gem and exams it.

                            BARLEY
                  Wow. There's only a few of these
                  left.

                            LAUREL
                  Hold on, is this dangerous?

                            BARLEY
                  We're about to find out.

      Barley puts the gem in the staff, holds out the staff, and
      gets suddenly serious. Everyone waits in suspense.



 
                                                                       27.


                               BARLEY
                   Ah!

                               LAUREL
                   What?!

                               BARLEY
                   Splinter.

      Barley grabs the staff, strikes a pose in the center of the
      room, and begins to read the spell.

                             BARLEY
                   "Only once is all we get, grant me
                   this rebirth. 'Til tomorrow's sun
                   has set, one day to walk the
                   earth!"

      But nothing happens.

                             BARLEY
                   Hold on, I was just gripping it
                   wrong.

      Barley adjusts his hands.

                             BARLEY
                   Only once is all we get, grant me
                   this rebirth, `til tomorrow's sun
                   has set, one day to walk THE EARTH!

      Still nothing.

      In quick cuts, Barley tries again and again, with no success.

                             BARLEY
                   Only once is all we get, grant me
                   this rebirth.

      He tries again.

                             BARLEY
                   `Til tomorrow's sun has set...

      And again.

                             BARLEY
                   ...one day to walk THE EARTH!

      And again, exhausted.

                             BARLEY
                   One day to walk the earth!



 
                                                                       28.


      Losing his patience.

                            BARLEY
                  `Til tomorrow's sun has set...

      Again, frustrated.

                            BARLEY
                  One day to walk the earth!

      With everything he has left.

                            BARLEY
                  ...One day... to walk... the earth!

      One more big attempt.

                            BARLEY
                  `Til tomorrow's sun has set...

      Laurel and Ian have already given up.

                            BARLEY
                  One day to walk the earth!

                            LAUREL
                       (gentle)
                  Barley.

      He looks back to her, then puts the staff down and sits on
      the bed. Laurel puts her hand on Barley's shoulder. All three
      of them are heartbroken.

                            LAUREL
                  I'm sorry you guys don't have your
                  Dad here, but this shows just how
                  much he wanted to see you both. So
                  much that he'd try anything. That's
                  still a pretty special gift.

                              IAN
                  Yeah.

      Barley leaves.

                            LAUREL
                       (to Ian)
                  Hey, want to come with me to pick
                  up your cake?

                            IAN
                  That's okay. Thanks, Mom.




 
                                                                       29.


      As Laurel gets to the door, she looks back at Ian with a sad
      smile, then leaves. Ian sits on his bed, crestfallen.


      INT. IAN'S BEDROOM - EVENING

      Ian at his desk, looking at all the pictures of Dad on his
      bulletin board. He examines Dad's spell, reading it aloud.

                            IAN
                  Only once is all we get, grant me
                  this rebirth...

      Suddenly, an orange light glows on Ian's face. He turns to
      see the Phoenix Gem is glowing. He looks back at the spell.

                            IAN
                  'Til tomorrow's sun has set...

      The gem glows brighter. Objects in the room raise from the
      ground. The staff shakes and starts to fall.

      As Ian catches it, the staff lights up. He tightens his grip
      and reads louder.

                            IAN
                  One day to walk the earth!

      A beam of light shoots from the staff. Ian holds on with all
      his might as objects in the room swirl around him.

      Barley opens the door.

                             BARLEY
                  Hey man, what are you doing in
                  here?
                        (startled)
                  Holy Tooth of Zadar! How did you--?

                            IAN
                  I don't know, it just started!

      Blazey pokes her head in the door but quickly runs away.

      Ian strains to hold the staff. The light from the staff
      conjures a pair of shoes.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa, feet!

      Above the shoes, bright purple socks appear. Then pant cuffs,
      pant legs, a belt, a shirt, one button at a time...




 
                                                                      30.


      The gem slowly lifts out of the staff and spins. An ominous
      red light swells from the gem, overpowering Ian.

      Dad's body recedes to the waist. Ian braces with all he has.

                            BARLEY
                  Hang on, I can help!

      Barley reaches for the staff. Ian pulls away from Barley.

                            IAN
                  BARLEY, NO!

      The red swell explodes. The gem BURSTS into pieces.


      EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      The window of Ian's room blasts out.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Barley helps Ian up. Ian looks around, desperate. There's no
      sign of dad in the empty, disheveled room.

      Suddenly there's a rustling in the closet. The boys perk up.
      A pair of legs in khaki pants and dress shoes clumsily begin
      to kick their way out from behind the clothes.

                              IAN
                  Dad?

      The legs stand to reveal... they have no torso.

                              IAN
                  AH!

                            BARLEY
                  AH! He's just legs!

      Ian and Barley cautiously approach the living pants as Dad's
      feet begin to feel their way around the space.

                            BARLEY
                  There's no top part. I definitely
                  remember Dad having a top part!

                            IAN
                  Oh, what did I do? This is
                  horrible!




 
                                                                      31.


      The pants start to make their way toward Ian and Barley. Ian
      calms himself, then approaches Dad's pants. He reaches out,
      waving his hand through Dad's missing torso.

                               IAN
                  Hello?

      Dad begins to feel around with his foot and walk blindly.

                            BARLEY
                  It's really him.
                       (beat)
                  DAD! You are in your house!

      Dad bumps into a dresser and falls. The boys race over to
      help him up.

                            IAN
                  Whoa, whoa!

                               BARLEY
                  Oh boy!

                            IAN
                  Ah, he can't hear us.

      Barley thinks, then walks over and taps on Dad's foot: Shave
      and a Haircut.

                            IAN
                  What are you doing?

      Dad's legs suddenly leap back with emotion - as much emotion
      as legs can have. He stomps the final two beats of the song.

      Dad touches Barley's feet with his foot, patting gently.

                            BARLEY
                  That's right Dad. It's me, Barley.

      Dad feels around, finds Ian's foot, and does the same.

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah, that's Ian.

                               IAN
                  Hi... Dad.

      This lands on Ian, and he puts his hand delicately on Dad's
      foot. It's the closest they can get to a hug.

                            IAN
                  Oh... I messed this whole thing up
                  and now he's gonna be legs forever!


 
                                                                      32.


                            BARLEY
                  Well, not... forever. The spell
                  only lasts one day. At sunset
                  tomorrow, he'll disappear and we'll
                  never be able to bring him back
                  again.

      Barley points to the spell, illustrations of the sun setting
      and the man vanishing.

                            IAN
                  Okay, okay, okay. Twenty-Four
                  hours...that doesn't give us much
                  time, but--

      Ian looks at his phone, broken in the chaos. He chucks it on
      his bed and sets his watch. Twenty-four hours counting down.

                            IAN
                  Well, we'll just have to do the
                  spell again.

                            BARLEY
                  You mean you have to.
                       (beat)
                  A person can only do magic if they
                  have the gift. And my little
                  brother has the magic gift!

      Barley pulls Ian into a playful headlock. Ian pushes away.

                            IAN
                  But I couldn't even finish the
                  spell.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, you're gonna have plenty of
                  time to practice. Because we have
                  to find another Phoenix Gem.

      Barley gets an idea. He flips through his Quests of Yore
      cards then holds one up to Ian. It shows an old pub: THE
      MANTICORE'S TAVERN.

                            BARLEY
                  Ah-ha! We'll start at the place
                  where all quests begin. The
                  Manticore's Tavern!

      Then another card: THE MANTICORE, a fearsome winged beast.




 
                                                             33.


                            BARLEY
                  It's run by a fearless adventurer.
                  She knows where to find any kind of
                  gem, talisman, totem...

                            IAN
                  Barley, this is for a game.

                            BARLEY
                  Based on real life!

                            IAN
                  But, how do we know this tavern is
                  still there?

                            BARLEY
                  It's there. Look, my years of
                  training have prepared me for this
                  very moment. And I'm telling you...
                  this is the only way to find a
                  Phoenix Gem.

      Barley holds up a card featuring THE PHOENIX GEM.

                              BARLEY
                  Trust me.

      Ian looks longingly at Dad.

                            IAN
                  Whatever it takes, I am gonna meet
                  my dad.

                            BARLEY
                  You hear that, Dad? We're going on
                  a quest!


      EXT. BARLEY'S VAN - SUNSET

      Ian slams his door. Barley slams his door.


      INT. BARLEY'S VAN - CONTINUOUS

      Seatbelt on, keys in the ignition, the gears grind.

                            BARLEY
                       (straining)
                  Come on, Guinevere...

                            IAN
                  Uh... Maybe we should just take the
                  bus.


 
                                                                       34.


                            BARLEY
                  She's fine.

      The van starts. Barley grabs a cassette tape labeled "QUEST
      MIX" and pops it in the stereo. Sweeping fantasy music plays.

                              BARLEY
                  H'YAH!

      The van backfires and spits black smoke as it heads away from
      the cookie cutter suburban homes, toward the fantastical
      purple mountains in the distance.


      EXT. SUBURBAN FANTASY TOWN - NIGHT - MONTAGE

      The van travels past a road sign: "Leaving New Mushroomton."
      The van passes through a TROLL BOOTH.


      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

      Ian sits in the back, talking to Dad's legs, working on
      something we can't quite see.

                            IAN
                  Anyway, it's like this award for
                  math, it's no big deal. But I'll
                  show you when we get back home.

      Barley looks in the rearview mirror.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey, what are you two Chatty
                  Charlies up to back there?

                            IAN
                  You know, I felt weird talking to
                  Dad without a top half, so...

      Ian picks something up and puts it on Dad, he steps aside to
      reveal it's a top half made out of stuffed clothes.

                              IAN
                  ...Ta-da!

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! That's great! Dad, you look
                  just like I remember.

      Dad starts to wander toward the front seat.




 
                                                                     35.


                            BARLEY
                  Hey, don't worry, we'll have the
                  rest of you here before you know
                  it. And then, first thing I'm gonna
                  do: introduce you to Guinevere.
                  Rebuilt this old girl myself, from
                  the lug nuts to the air
                  conditioning.

      Barley flips on the air conditioning. It BLASTS like a leaf
      blower. Ian fights against the wind to turn it off.

                            IAN
                  Showing Dad your van? That's your
                  whole list?

                               BARLEY
                  What list?

                               IAN
                  Oh...

                            BARLEY
                  What's that?

                            IAN
                       (a little embarrassed)
                  I'm just working on a list of
                  things I wanted to do with Dad. You
                  know, play catch, take a walk,
                  driving lesson, share my whole life
                  story with him.

      Barley nods, appreciative.

                            BARLEY
                  That's cool.
                       (beat)
                  Oh, but before you cast Dad's spell
                  again, you're gonna have to
                  practice your magic.

      Barley tosses Ian the Quests of Yore book.

                            IAN
                  This book is for a game.

                            BARLEY
                  I told you, everything in Quests of
                  Yore is historically accurate! Even
                  the spells. So start practicing,
                  young sorcerer!

      Barley hands Ian the staff. Ian opens the book.


 
                                                                       36.


                            IAN
                  Okay, Dad. Let's try some magic.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Laurel sees a note taped to Ian's door: "Back soon with MIND-
      BLOWING surprise!" along with a crude drawing of Laurel with
      a mushroom cloud blowing from the top of her head.

      She opens the door.


      INT. IAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Laurel GASPS. Ian's bedroom looks like a bomb went off.

      She notices Ian's broken phone on the bed. Then walks over to
      the Quests of Yore cards Barley laid out earlier: The Phoenix
      Gem and the Manticore's Tavern.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

      Laurel grabs her car keys off of the hook.


      EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - NIGHT

      She pulls out of the garage in her car.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Headlights shine on a pewter figurine on Barley's game board:
      part lion, part bat, part scorpion: THE MANTICORE.


      EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

      Barley's van drives through a muddy back road.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      Ian points the staff at an empty soda can.

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar.

      Nothing happens.

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar.


 
                                                                    37.


      Still nothing. Ian turns to Barley, picks up the Quests of
      Yore book gestures to a levitation spell in it.

                            IAN
                  I can't get this levitation spell
                  to work. Maybe I should try
                  something else, like...
                       (flipping pages)
                  Arcane Lightning?

                             BARLEY
                  Pfft, yeah, like a level one mage
                  could bust out the hardest spell in
                  the Enchanter's Guide Book.
                        (nerdy laugh)
                  Maybe we'll stick with the easy
                  ones.

                            IAN
                  Yeah, well, it's not working. Am I
                  saying it wrong?

                            BARLEY
                  You said it right, it's just for
                  any spell to work you have to speak
                  from your heart's fire.

                              IAN
                  My what?

                            BARLEY
                  Your heart's fire, you must speak
                  with passion, don't hold back.

      Ian seems doubtful about this advice.

                            IAN
                       (trying harder)
                  Aloft Elevar!

      Nothing.

                            BARLEY
                  No, like - Aloft Elevar!

                            IAN
                       (angry, louder)
                  Aloft Elevar!

                            BARLEY
                  No, from your heart's fire!

                            IAN
                  ALOFT ELEVAR!


 
                                                                      38.


                            BARLEY
                  DON'T HOLD BACK!

                            IAN
                  ALOFT ELEVAR!

                            BARLEY
                  HEART'S FIRE!

      Ian tosses the staff in frustration.

                            IAN
                  STOP SAYING HEARTS FIRE! This just
                  clearly isn't working!

      Ian sits defeated next to Dad.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey, it was a good start.

      Ian stares at the Visitation spell, then looks to Dad,
      disappointed in himself.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! Gather your courage, we've
                  arrived. The Manticore's Tavern.

      Ian looks out the window to see an old tavern, just like the
      one on the Quests of Yore card.

                            IAN
                  Wow, it is still here.

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah! I told you.


      EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

      Ian and Barley approach the tavern. Ian has to tug on Dad's
      leash to keep him moving in the right direction.

                            IAN
                  Come on, Dad! That's good.

      They approach the ominous entrance, with a carving of the
      Manticore's fearsome face above the door.

                            BARLEY
                  Alright, listen, first: let me do
                  the talking.
                            (MORE)




 
                                                                       39.

                            BARLEY (CONT'D)
                  Secondly, it's crucial we show the
                  fearless Manticore the respect she
                  deserves or she will thirdly, not
                  give us a map to a Phoenix Gem.

                            IAN
                  Whoa, whoa, wait, the map?! I
                  thought she had a Phoenix Gem?

                             BARLEY
                        (nerd laugh)
                  You're so cute.
                        (to Dad)
                  Hear that, Dad? He's a smart kid,
                  he just doesn't know how quests
                  work.

                            IAN
                  Well, is there anything else you're
                  forgetting to tell me?

                              BARLEY
                  Nope.

      Barley pushes open the door.


      INT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      The place is a ridiculous family restaurant, just full
      frontal Fuddruckers. A large table of revelers sing along
      with the waitstaff, around a birthday cake.

                            WAITERS
                       (singing)
                  Happy happy birthday,
                  Come join us on our quest,
                  To make your birthday party,
                  The very, very best! HEY!

      Ian looks at Barley, losing faith in his brother.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, okay, so the tavern changed a
                  little over the years, but the
                  Manticore is still the real deal.

      Ian and Barley walk through the restaurant, taking it all in.

      A TAVERN WAITRESS takes an order at a nearby table.

                            TAVERN PATRON
                  I'll have the soup of the day.



 
                                                                       40.


                            TAVERN WAITRESS
                  Would m'lord like a Cup or
                  Cauldron?

      An elf kid plays a claw drop game with a gauntlet hand
      picking up treasure. He loses.

      Barley marches up a Hostess.

                            BARLEY
                  Madame, I request an audience...
                       (bowing)
                  ...with the Manticore!

                            HOSTESS
                  But of course, m'lord.

      The Hostess blows into a fake horn.

                            HOSTESS
                  Oh, Manticore!

      A plush COSTUMED MANTICORE leaps into frame. Adorable and
      silly, it lets out a CHUCKLE and hugs Ian. Barley pushes the
      Costumed Manticore away from Ian, irritated.

                            BARLEY
                  No, no, no, no no! The real
                  Manticore! The fearless adventurer!

      The costumed Manticore rubs its eyes like it's crying.

                            HOSTESS
                  Oh, you mean Corey? She's over
                  there.

      The hostess gestures toward the kitchen.


      INT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      The kitchen doors burst open as a frantic Manticore struggles
      to balance plates. No longer a fearless adventurer, she wears
      a restaurant uniform, glasses, and a wrist brace.

                            MANTICORE
                  QUICK, SOMEBODY HELP ME! These
                  griffin nuggets were supposed to go
                  out minutes ago!

      Waiters rushes in and she scrambles to offload the plates.

                            IAN
                  That's the Manticore?


 
                                                             41.


      Barley leaps forward and takes a knee.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, great and powerful Manticore!

                            MANTICORE
                  Whoah, sir! You're right in the hot
                  zone.

      A GOBLIN COOK passes by her.

                            MANTICORE
                  You're late, Adolphus.

                              ADOLPHUS
                         (goblin language)

                            MANTICORE
                  I understand there's traffic, you
                  need to plan for that!

      The goblin heads onto the floor for his shift.

                              ADOLPHUS
                         (goblin language)

                            MANTICORE
                  Well maybe your mother should get
                  her own car!

                            BARLEY
                  Your fearlessness?

      The Manticore turns toward the boys, startled.

                              MANTICORE
                  AHH!

                            BARLEY
                  My brother and I seek a map... to a
                  Phoenix Gem.

                            MANTICORE
                  Oh, uh, well you've come to the
                  right tavern.
                       (aside to waiter, handing
                       off plate)
                  Table 12.

      She quickly races to a host podium and digs around.

                            MANTICORE
                  I have the parchment you desire
                  right here! BEHOLD!


 
                                                                       42.


      She presents them with a children's menu that says "FIND THE
      PHOENIX GEM!" above a variety of puzzles.

                            IAN
                  Oh... that's a children's menu.

                            MANTICORE
                  Isn't that fun? They're all based
                  on my old maps.
                       (quick, formal)
                  Oh, uh, "The great Manticore sends
                  you on your adventure with a hero's
                  blessing." And here's some crayons.

      She hurries off, but Barley follows reverently.

                            BARLEY
                  That's very amusing your dominance,
                  but might you have the real map?

      The Manticore points to a wall of swords, shields, scrolls.

                            MANTICORE
                  Uh... yeah, it's over there.

      Ian points to a map on the wall with the title: PHOENIX GEM.

                               IAN
                  That's it!

                            BARLEY
                  This is perfect!

      Barley reaches for the scroll, but the Manticore grabs it.

                            MANTICORE
                  Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you
                  doing? You can't take this.

                            BARLEY
                  We have to.

      Barley removes Dad's torso to reveal he's just legs. The
      Manticore looks aghast, unsure what she's seeing.

                            MANTICORE
                  What is that?

      The Manticore Mascot walks past and sees the legs. Stunned,
      the mascot bumps into a serving tray and FALLS to the ground.

                            IAN
                  It's our dad, and we have a chance
                  to meet him, but--


 
                                                                   43.


      Barley steps in front of Ian, taking over.

                            BARLEY
                  Buuuut... we can't do that without
                  a Phoenix Gem.

      The Manticore considers this.

                            MANTICORE
                  No! My days of sending people on
                  dangerous quests are over.

                               BARLEY
                  What? Why?

                            MANTICORE
                  Uh, cause they're dangerous!

      The HOSTESS pops around the corner.

                            HOSTESS
                  Corey, the karaoke machine is
                  broken again.

      The Manticore sees a group of female fantasy creatures in
      matching shirts surrounding a cyclops in a veil.

                            MANTICORE
                       (to the boys)
                  I'm sorry, but you are not getting
                  this map.


      INT. KARAOKE AREA - NIGHT

      The Manticore grovels to the bachelorette party.

                            MANTICORE
                       (worried, stressed)
                  Don't worry, ladies, your adventure
                  will continue momentarily!

                            BARLEY
                       (to Ian)
                  Okay, I can handle this.

      Ian pushes past Barley to approach the Manticore.

                               BARLEY
                  No, Ian!

                            BRIDESMAID #1
                  You're ruining Althea's special
                  day!


 
                                                                 44.


                            IAN
                  Miss... Mighty Manticore, ma'am--?

                            BARLEY
                  What are you doing?

                            MANTICORE
                  Kid, this is not a good time.

      The karaoke machine lets out a squall of feedback.

                            BRIDESMAID #1
                  I'm giving this place a one-star
                  review!

                            IAN
                  It's just, I've never met my Dad
                  and--

                            MANTICORE
                  Look, I'm sorry about that, but if
                  you get hurt on one of my quests
                  guess who gets sued and loses her
                  tavern? I can't take that kind of
                  risk! Now if you'll just excuse me
                  I have important things to do!
                       (into mic)
                  Testing.
                       (singing)
                  You haunt my dreams, my in-
                  betweens...

      Ian looks at Dad's purple socks. He steps up.

                            IAN
                  Please, we need that map!

                            MANTICORE
                  No, I am not giving you the map!
                  That's it! I'm done talking!

      Ian stands up straight and looks determined.

                            IAN
                  Well... well, I'm not!

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

      The Manticore looks up, surprised. Barley looks at Ian,
      equally surprised.




 
                                                                    45.


                            IAN
                  You say you can't "risk" losing
                  this place? Look at that Manticore!

      Ian points to a heroic painting of the warrior Manticore.

                            IAN
                  She looks like she lived to take
                  risks!

                            MANTICORE
                  That Manticore didn't have
                  investors to look out for. She
                  didn't have payroll to cover!

      The Manticore stands up, gesturing wildly.

                            MANTICORE
                  She could just fly out the door
                  whenever she wanted and slay a
                  magma beast.

                            BRIDESMAID #2
                  Are you gonna fix the machine or
                  not?

                            MANTICORE
                  Yeah, in a minute!

      The startled bridesmaid backs off.

                            MANTICORE
                  Okay, maybe this place isn't as
                  adventurous as it used to be, so it
                  isn't filled with a motley horde
                  willing to risk life and limb for
                  the mere taste of excitement...

      A pathetic patron blows on his soup.

                            MANTICORE
                  ...but so what?! Whoever said you
                  have to take risks in life to have
                  an adventure?!

      Ian nervously points behind the Manticore.

                            IAN
                  Apparently, you did.

      The Manticore looks at her portrait, Above it is a plaque:

                  YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS IN LIFE TO HAVE AN
                  ADVENTURE. - THE MANTICORE


 
                                                                       46.


      The Manticore is speechless.

      A ROGUE WAITER walks up with a plate of mozzarella sticks.

                            ROGUE WAITER
                  Table 32 said their mozzarella
                  sticks are cold.

      The Manticore breathes fire on the mozzarella sticks.
      Terrified, the waiter scuttles away.

                            MANTICORE
                  What have I done?

                            IAN
                  Well, it's not too late. I mean,
                  you could just give us the map--

                            MANTICORE
                  This place used to be dangerous--

      The Chuck E. Cheese-style Manticore mascot stands behind the
      real Manticore and begins to imitate her movements.

                               COSTUMED MANTICORE
                  Dangerous!

                            MANTICORE
                  --and wild.

                               COSTUMED MANTICORE
                  Wild!

                            MANTICORE
                  I used to be dangerous and wild!

                            COSTUMED MANTICORE
                  Dangerous and wild!

      The Manticore stares daggers at the mascot moving behind her.
      She tackles it, rips off its foam head, and holds it up
      proudly with a mighty roar.

                            MANTICORE
                  I'm living a lie -- WHAT HAVE I
                  BECOME?!

      She torches the mascot head. Parents cover a child's eyes.

                               BARLEY
                  Oh no...

      The Manticore throws the smoldering, melting mascot head and
      it lands on a table between two customers.


 
                                                                       47.


                            MANTICORE
                  Everybody out! This tavern is
                  closed for remodeling!

      The mascot head ignites a banner that burns into the rafters.


      INT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      Patrons watch in terror as the fire spreads. Kids are grabbed
      and hurried out the doors by their terrified parents. One kid
      is torn away from coloring her children's menu.


      EXT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

      Terrified patrons stream from the blazing building.


      INT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      The Manticore has completely lost it.

                            MANTICORE
                  Sorry, the karaoke machine is
                  broken!

      Manticore throws the karaoke machine against the wall
      knocking away the dry wall and revealing the stone beneath.

      The Manticore picks up a cardboard standee of herself and
      throws it to the ground with a yell. She throws the Phoenix
      Gem map with it.

      Ian watches in horror as the map catches fire. He races to
      the map, but it's too late. All that's left is ashes.

                            IAN
                  No, no, no, no! No! ...No.

      A beam falls behind them.

                            BARLEY
                  We gotta go!

      They race through the restaurant, arm-in-arm with Dad, his
      torso detaches. His legs runs in the wrong direction, bump
      into a wall, and fall to the ground.

      Ian realizes they've lost Dad. He turns and sees Dad
      struggling to stand. The roof above suddenly buckles. The
      wooden beams CRASH down, headed right for Dad.

      Without a thought, Ian lifts the staff and calls out.


 
                                                                       48.


                            IAN
                  ALOFT ELEVAR!

      A blast of light from the staff freezes the wooden beam in
      mid-air, mere inches from Dad. Ian strains to hold the spell.

      Barley rushes in and grabs Dad, pulling him to safety. Ian
      releases the spell and the beam CRASHES to the ground.
      Barley, Ian, and Dad flee from the burning tavern.


      EXT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      The van pulls away, past approaching fire trucks.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! That was unbelievable. You
                  were just like...
                       (magic sounds)
                  And the beam was just floatin'
                  there! My brother is a wizard!

                            IAN
                  I can't believe that worked.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, you're gonna nail Dad's spell
                  now.

                            IAN
                  Except we don't have a map.

                            BARLEY
                  But we've got this! BEHOLD!

      Barley reveals a kids' menu he grabbed. Ian sighs.

                             BARLEY
                  Look, on a quest, you have to use
                  what you've got. And this is what
                  we've got!

      Barley points to a crayon signature that reads: "KAYLA"

                            BARLEY
                  Best part is, little Kayla already
                  solved the puzzle.

      Ian takes the menu. The puzzle has been solved in crayon.




 
                                                                       49.


                            IAN
                  Well, according to Kayla, we just
                  have to look for "Raven's Point."

      Something dawns on him. Ian reaches down and takes out a map.

                            IAN
                  Raven's Point... Raven's Point...

      He slams a roadmap down on the dash and points to a mountain
      labeled: RAVEN'S POINT.

                            IAN
                  Raven's Point!

                            BARLEY
                  Yes! The gem must be in the
                  mountain. We can be there by
                  tomorrow morning.

                            IAN
                  Tomorrow morning?

                            BARLEY
                  That still gives us plenty of time
                  with Dad.

      Ian looks at Dad, disappointed.

                              IAN
                  Yeah.

      The van comes to a stop at a red light.

      Ian traces a route with his finger, right to Raven's Point.

                            IAN
                  Well, it looks like the expressway
                  should take us right there.

                            BARLEY
                  Eh, expressway is a little too
                  obvious. On a quest, the clear path
                  is never the right one--

                              IAN
                  What?

                            BARLEY
                  During one Quests of Yore campaign,
                  Shrub Rosehammer and I took the
                  easy route... led him straight into
                  the belly of a gelatinous cube.

                                                                      50.

                             BARLEY (CONT'D)
                  Only reason I didn't suffer the
                  same fate?
                       (slaps gut)
                  I followed my gut.

      Barley highlights barely-perceptible road on the map.

                            BARLEY
                  And it's telling me we take an
                  ancient trail called the Path of
                  Peril.

                            IAN
                  But the expressway is faster.

                            BARLEY
                  Maybe not in the long run.

                            IAN
                  I know you want this to be like one
                  of your adventure games, but all
                  that matters is that we get to
                  spend as much time as possible with
                  Dad.

      Dad breaks free from his seatbelt in back and wanders toward
      the front of the van, leaving his top half behind. He taps
      his foot against Barley's. Barley pats Dad's foot and sighs.

                            IAN
                  So, we should just take the
                  expressway.Right?

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah. You're right.
                       (beat)
                  But if you end up inside a
                  gelatinous cube, you are on your
                  own.

      Barley steers the van onto an onramp.


      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

      Just then, Laurel's car drives under the onramp just under
      the van, heading in the opposite direction from the boys.


      INT. LAUREL'S CAR - NIGHT

      A GPS screen navigates toward the Manticore's tavern.




 
                                                                     51.


                            GPS VOICE
                  Manticore's Tavern, ahead on your
                  right.

      A phone call interrupts the GPS. It's Colt. Laurel answers.

                              LAUREL
                  Hey.


      EXT. FRY FORTRESS - NIGHT

      Colt talks on the phone, carrying a bag of takeout.

                            COLT
                  I'm just checking in. Did you catch
                  up to the boys yet?

                            LAUREL
                  No, not yet. But I'm a little
                  worried because we had a weird
                  family issue come up and, well,
                  this just isn't like Ian to run
                  off.
                       (beat)
                  I mean, Barley, yes, but not Ian.

                            COLT
                  You know, it's late, you shouldn't
                  have to be out looking for them.


      INT. LAUREL'S CAR - NIGHT

                            LAUREL
                  I know, it's silly, I'm sure
                  they're both probably on fire...

      Laurel sees the Manticore's Tavern burning to the ground.

                              COLT
                  Fire?!

                            LAUREL
                  FIRE! The place is on fire! My
                  boys, oh no, I gotta go!

                              COLT
                  Laurel!


      EXT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - NIGHT

      Laurel gets out of the car and sees people from the tavern:


 
                                                                     52.


      The headless Manticore mascot, patting her smoking costume.

                            COSTUMED MANTICORE
                  Get it off, get it off, get it off!

      The bachelorette party, disheveled and crying.

                            LAUREL
                  Excuse me? Hello! Please, I'm
                  looking for two teenage elves?!

                            MANTICORE
                  Okay, okay, I told you already,
                  there were two teenage elves...

                            LAUREL
                  Oh! Those are my sons! Where did
                  they go?

      The Manticore sits on the side of the curb, wrapped in a
      silver emergency blanket, holding a mug.

                            MANTICORE
                  Oh, they went on a quest to find a
                  Phoenix Gem. But don't worry, don't
                  worry. I told them about the map,
                  and about the gem, and about the
                  curse.
                       (standing/dawning)
                  I forgot to tell them about the
                  curse!

                               LAUREL
                  The what?

                               OFFICER AVEL
                  Hoo boy...

      A police officer, OFFICER AVEL, leans in to talk to Laurel.

                            OFFICER AVEL
                  Listen, this one's gone a little
                       (whistle)

                            MANTICORE
                  Your boys are in grave danger! But
                  I can help--

      The Manticore starts to move toward Laurel. Officer Avel
      pulls the Manticore toward the police car.

                            OFFICER AVEL
                  Whoa, heyyy. You're not going
                  anywhere. We got questions for you.


 
                                                                       53.


                            MANTICORE
                       (calling to Laurel)
                  I know where they're going! We can
                  still save them!

      Laurel looks around, concerned. She's sees a first aid kit in
      the back of an ambulance and gets an idea.


      EXT. TAVERN - MOMENTS LATER

      The Manticore talks with Officer Avel by a police car.

                            MANTICORE
                  Last name "Manticore." First name,
                  "The."

      Laurel walks up to Officer Avel and the Manticore.

                             LAUREL
                  Hold on! You're right, she has gone
                  a little--
                        (whistle)
                  It's no wonder with a wound like
                  that.

      Laurel points dramatically to a slight scrape on the
      Manticore's leg.

                            OFFICER AVEL
                  That's just a scratch.

      Laurel pulls out the Quests of Yore card about the Manticore
      and waves it around like it's an official document.

                             LAUREL
                  Oh, I'm sorry, are you an expert on
                  minotaurs?

                            MANTICORE
                       (correcting)
                  Manticores.

                            LAUREL
                  --Manticores?

                              OFFICER AVEL
                  Well, no.

                            LAUREL
                  Well then you wouldn't know that
                  when their blood is exposed to air,
                  it makes them go bonkers.



 
                                                                     54.


                            MANTICORE
                  I don't think that's true.

                            LAUREL
                  See! She's already losing her grip
                  on reality. So why don't you let me
                  save her life before it costs you
                  yours?

      Officer Avel throws his hands in the air.

                              OFFICER AVEL
                  Okay!

                            LAUREL
                  Thank you! Could we have a little
                  privacy here, please?

      Officer Avel steps away.

                            LAUREL (O.S.)
                  Just lie back. That's good.

                            OFFICER AVEL
                  Just don't take too long back
                  there, okay?
                       (beat)
                  Hey, you hear me?

      Officer Avel turns and looks at the Manticore's silhouette,
      then carefully walks back toward the police car.

                            OFFICER AVEL
                  I said, don't take too long back
                  there, because I--

      As he gets closer, he sees the source of Manticore's
      silhouette: The melted mascot head, propped up as a decoy.

                              OFFICER AVEL
                  Ahh!


      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

      Laurel's car drives away, the back dragging sparks.


      INT. LAUREL'S CAR - NIGHT

      The Manticore is hunkered down in the backseat of the car.

                            LAUREL
                  Alright, how do we help my boys?


 
                                                                     55.


      The Manticore smiles.

                            MANTICORE
                  Oooooh, I'm gonna like you!


      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

      The van passes through a city.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      Barley drives as Ian and Dad sit on bean bags in the back.
      Ian stares at the list he's made.

                            BARLEY
                  Radio... headlights... brakes,
                  tires, rims... I mean it's hard to
                  tell now, Dad, before I replaced
                  her parts, Guinevere was actually
                  kind of a piece of junk.

      Ian looks over at Dad and crosses things off his list.

                            IAN
                  Looks like we're not gonna get to
                  do everything today, Dad. But,
                  that's okay, I just wanna meet you.

      Dad rubs his foot against Ian's. Ian smiles.

                            IAN
                  But don't worry, we'll have you
                  fixed up and back home to see...
                       (dawning)
                  Oh man, Mom! Barley, we're not
                  going to be able to get Dad back in
                  time to see Mom.

                              BARLEY
                  Oh...
                       (beat)
                  Well, Dad... at least you won't
                  have to meet the new guy.

      Barley puts his finger up to his face to create a mustache.

                            BARLEY
                       (Colt impression)
                  So you, uh, workin' hard or hardly
                  workin'?
                       (horse chuckle)



 
                                                                       56.


                              IAN
                  Yeah!
                       (bad Colt impression)
                  Barley, Barley, Barley. Every time
                  there's trouble, I gotta deal with
                  you.

                            BARLEY
                  Is that your Colt?!

                              IAN
                  Yeah?

                            BARLEY
                  You're gonna wanna work on that.

      Suddenly the van begins to SPUTTER.

                            BARLEY
                  No, no, no, NO! Come on, old girl!

      Barley pulls the van off the expressway and lurches it to a
      stop on the side of the road.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

                            IAN
                  I thought you said you fixed the
                  van.

                            BARLEY
                  Relax, Guinevere is fine. Her
                  stomach is just a little empty.

      Ian looks over at the gas gauge. The needle is on "F."

                            IAN
                  But it says we have a full tank.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, that doesn't work.


      EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

      Barley gets out, goes to the back of the van, pulls out a gas
      can, and shakes it next to his ear.

                            BARLEY
                  Only a few drops left.

      Ian gets out. Barley climbs on top of Guinevere.



 
                                                                      57.


                            BARLEY
                  Maybe there's a gas station...

      There's nothing within sight. Ian looks at the staff.

                            IAN
                  Is there a magic way to get gas?

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! I like your thinking young
                  mage.

      Barley scrambles down from the van and shows Ian a page in
      the spell book: an illustration of a wizard growing an apple
      to five times its size.

                            BARLEY
                  Growth Spell! We grow the can and
                  then the gas inside will grow with
                  it.

                            IAN
                  Uhh... that's kind of a weird
                  idea...

                            BARLEY
                  I know! I like it too!

      Ian mutters to himself as he holds the spell and the staff.

                            IAN
                  Okay, loosen up, heart's fire. Here
                  we go.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa, it's not that simple.
                       (to Dad)
                  This one learns a little magic and
                  thinks he's Shamblefoot the
                  Wondrous, am I right, Dad?
                       (to Ian)
                  A growth spell is a bit more
                  advanced. Not only do you have to
                  speak from your heart's fire, but
                  now you also have to follow a magic
                  decree.

                            IAN
                  A magic what?

      Barley shows Ian the book.




 
                                                                      58.


                            BARLEY
                  It's a special rule that keeps the
                  spell working right. This one
                  states: "To magnify an object, you
                  have to magnify your attention upon
                  it."
                       (beat)
                  While you cast the spell, you can't
                  let anything distract you.

      Barley puts the gas can on the ground. Ian points the staff.

                            IAN
                  Okay...
                       (exhale)
                  Ow!

                              BARLEY
                  What?

                            IAN
                  Splinter! Can we sand this thing
                  down?

                            BARLEY
                  No! It's an ancient staff with
                  magic in every glorious fiber, you
                  can't "sand it down."

                            IAN
                  Alright, alright. Here we go.
                       (sotto)
                  Focus...

      Ian holds out the staff and tries to focus.

                              BARLEY
                  Uh...

                            IAN
                  Something wrong?

                            BARLEY
                  Sorry, it's just, your stance is
                  uh... Here.

      Barley poses Ian awkwardly, all over his personal space.

                             BARLEY
                  Chin up, elbows out, feet apart,
                  back slightly arched... Okay, how's
                  that feel?




 
                                                                       59.


                            IAN
                       (strained)
                  Great.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! One more thing.

                               IAN
                  Barley!

                            BARLEY
                  Okay! Okay.

      Barley tries to adjust Ian's elbow one more time. Ian shoots
      him a look. Barley throws up his hands and steps back.

      Ian focuses hard and recites the spell.

                            IAN
                  Magnora Gantuan!

      The staff throws off violent, flashing sparks. Ian winces,
      but does his best to stay focused. The can begins to grow.

                            BARLEY
                  Don't let the magic spook you.

                               IAN
                  Okay.

                               BARLEY
                  Elbows!

                               IAN
                  What?!

                               BARLEY
                  Elbows up!

      Ian lifts his elbows as high as possible.

                            BARLEY
                  No, no, no, too high. That's too
                  high.

                            IAN
                  I'm trying to focus here!

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Focus on the
                  can!

      Barley encourages Ian -- slowly, almost to himself -- but so,
      deeply annoying.


 
                                                         60.


                            BARLEY
                  Focuuuuuus...
                       (beat)
                  Focuuuuuuuuuussssss...

                            IAN
                  Barley!
                       (failing)
                  Ah, forget it!

      Ian lowers the staff, frustrated.

                            BARLEY (O.S.)
                  It worked! The can is huge!

      Ian looks down to see that Barley is now TINY.

                            BARLEY
                  And the van is huge!
                       (to Ian)
                  And you're--

      Barley looks at his tiny body.

                              BARLEY
                  Oh, no...

                            IAN
                  What happened?

                            BARLEY
                  Looks like you shrunk me.

                            IAN
                  Wha-- how?!

                            BARLEY
                  Well, if you mess up a spell, there
                  are consequences.

                            IAN
                  I only messed up because you
                  wouldn't stop bothering me!

                            BARLEY
                  I was trying to help you!

                            IAN
                  Well, don't try to help me!

                            BARLEY
                  Oh okay, fine, I won't!




 
                                                                     61.


      As the boys argue, Dad taps Ian's foot then searches for
      Barley. Dad taps Barley's head, nearly stepping on him.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa, ow! Dad, it's me!

      Barley does "Shave and a Haircut" on Dad's foot. Dad freaks
      out, recognizing him and reacting to his shrunken size.

                            IAN
                  Whoah, Dad, it's okay, don't worry,
                  I'm going fix this!

      Ian grabs Dad's leash and picks up the gas can.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, where are you going?

                            IAN
                  To find a gas station.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, I'm going too.

                              IAN
                  Fine.

      Ian tries to pick up Barley, but Barley refuses.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey, I don't need your help!

                            IAN
                  Fine with me.

      Ian struggles to carry everything as Barley runs after Ian.


      EXT. INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

      Ian with Dad. A tiny, shrunken Barley tries to keep up.

                            BARLEY
                       (panting)
                  I just need a little break. My baby
                  legs can't go that fast.

      Ian walks back and awkwardly picks up Barley by the shirt.

                            BARLEY
                  Look, a gas station!

      Ian turns to see a glowing gas station in the distance.



 
                                                                         62.


                              IAN
                  Oh, good.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh wait, I forgot.
                       (struggling to turn away)
                  You don't need my help.

      Ian drops Barley into his pocket and charges ahead.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey! I don't need you to carry me!
                  I'm a grown man!


      EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

      Ian approaches the gas station, Barley and Dad in tow. He
      walks past a gas pump. Dad searches the ground with his foot.

                            IAN
                  Dad, come on, it's okay, Barley is
                  with me.

      Barley looks at his reflection in the gas pump.

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah, I'm fine, Dad. The side
                  effects are supposed to wear off
                  eventually. Do I look any bigger
                  yet?

      A group   of loudly revving, seemingly unmanned motorcycles
      park in   front of the gas station. Suddenly, a sprite in a
      leather   jacket, DEWDROP, pops out from behind the bike. Other
      sprites   appear. They were all collectively driving the bikes.

      They hop off and swagger into the gas station.

      An elf walks out of the gas station drinking a slushie. He
      unknowingly hits Dewdrop with the door on his way out.

                            DEWDROP
                  Hey! Did you just bump into me?

                            GAS STATION VICTIM
                  Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I didn't
                  see you there--

                            DEWDROP
                  Do it again, and you'll see me in
                  your nightmares!

      He drops his slushie and runs away.


 
                                                                      63.


      INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

      Ian slinks into the station, Dad in tow, Barley in pocket.

      Sprites climb the shelves, throw things to their cohorts,
      drink from the soda fountain. A sprite on the counter
      scratches a lotto ticket. Another throws money at the clerk.

                            COBWEB
                  Gimme a bag of Extra Sours.

      The clerk hands over a bag.

                            COBWEB
                  Keep the change.

      The sprites pass Ian, carrying a box of candy-filled straws.

                            COBWEB
                  Outta the way, beanstalk.

      Ian tries to keep a low profile as he talks to the CLERK.

                            IAN
                  Uh, ten on pump two, please.

      Barley leans out of Ian's pocket, reaching for a bag of
      snacks, but knocks over the entire rack.

                            IAN
                  What are you doing?!

                            BARLEY
                  I'm getting us food.

      Ian pushes a few bags of cheese puffs forward.

                            IAN
                  Alright, I got it. And a couple of
                  these, thank you.

                            BARLEY
                  Pssst! I have to go to the
                  bathroom!

                            IAN
                  Can it wait?

                            BARLEY
                  It's your pocket.

      Ian turns back to the clerk.




 
                                                                       64.


                            IAN
                  Can we have the bathroom key,
                  please?

      The clerk hands them a bathroom key attached to a license
      plate. Ian takes Barley out of his pocket and gives him the
      key. Tiny Barley has to carry the key over his head.

                            IAN
                  Okay, be quick. I want to get out
                  of here.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, I'm going.

      Barley runs to the bathroom. Dad searches around with his
      foot for little Barley and just misses him.

                            GAS STATION CLERK
                  That'll be twelve ninety-nine.

      Ian hands money to the cashier. Dad continues to search for
      little Barley, and taps the head of one of the sprites.

                            MUSTARDSEED
                  Hey! Watch it!

      Dewdrop leaps over to Dad and puffs out her chest.

                            DEWDROP
                  You got a problem, Shades?!

      Dad stares at her.

                            DEWDROP
                  Answer me when I'm talking to you!

      Ian turns to see that Dewdrop staring down Dad from high on a
      shelf. Ian grabs Dad and pulls him away.

                            IAN
                  Sorry, I don't really know where
                  his head is at right now.

      Ian pulls Dad to the door and EXITS.

                            IAN
                       (sotto)
                  How could this night get any worse?




 
                                                                      65.


      EXT. LAUREL'S CAR - NIGHT

      Laurel's car speeds down the highway, the passenger side
      drags along the ground, sparks shooting out.


      INT. LAUREL'S CAR - NIGHT

      Laurel drives. The Manticore is tight in the passenger seat.

                            MANTICORE
                  You know, I would fly us to help
                  your boys, but... the old wings
                  aren't what they used to be.

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, that's fine. So, about this
                  curse--

      The Manticore wiggles her wings a little.

                            MANTICORE
                  It's my own fault. I should be
                  doing my wing exercises every
                  morning, but you know how that
                  goes...

                            LAUREL
                  Please, the curse. What does it do?

                            MANTICORE
                  Right! Sorry. It's a Guardian
                  Curse.

      The Manticore rips off her sleeve to reveal an arm full of
      tattoos. She points to an image of a red cloud.

                            MANTICORE
                  If your boys take the gem, the
                  curse will rise up...

      She points to the red mist holding rocks together to make a
      beast attacking someone.

                            MANTICORE
                  ...and assume the form of a mighty
                  beast... and battle your sons to
                  the...
                       (catching herself)
                  Well... how do your boys do in a
                  crisis?




 
                                                                       66.


                            LAUREL
                  Not great! One of them is afraid of
                  everything and the other isn't
                  afraid of anything.

                            MANTICORE
                  Yeah, that skinny kid of yours is
                  pretty fearless.

                            LAUREL
                  No, no. You mean the big one.
                  Barley.

                            MANTICORE
                  No, the little guy. Woo, he really
                  let me have it.

                            LAUREL
                  What? No, look... You said you
                  could help them. Right?

      The Manticore points to a glowing circle in the "heart" of
      one of the beasts.

                            MANTICORE
                  Every curse has a core, the center
                  of its power. And only one weapon
                  forged of the rarest metals can
                  destroy it: my enchanted sword...

      The Manticore rips off her other sleeve to reveal a tattoo of
      a glowing yellow sword that reads: THE CURSE CRUSHER.

                            MANTICORE
                  ...the Curse Crusher!

                            LAUREL
                  Okay, but you don't seem to have
                  that on you.

      The Manticore looks a Laurel, embarrassed.

                            MANTICORE
                  I sold it. Got in a little tax
                  trouble a few years back. But don't
                  worry, I know just where to find
                  it.

      Laurel nods, determined.

                            LAUREL
                       (sotto)
                  I am on my way boys, just try to
                  stay out of trouble.


 
                                                                      67.


      EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

      Ian finishes pumping gas. He looks at his watch.

                            IAN
                       (to self)
                  Ugh, what is taking you so long?

      Then he hears something off in the distance.

                            DEWDROP (O.S.)
                  Who you calling whimsical?

      Ian looks over to see Barley in talking to two sprites.

                              IAN
                  Oh no.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

                            DEWDROP
                  You got a lotta nerve.

      Ian makes his way toward Barley while struggling with Dad.

                            BARLEY
                  I'm just saying sprites used to fly
                  around spreading delight. That's a
                  good thing.

                            DEWDROP
                  Sprites can't fly!

                            BARLEY
                  Well, your wings don't work 'cause
                  you stopped using them.

                            DEWDROP
                  You calling me lazy?

      She throws down her candy straw on the ground and stomps it.

                             BARLEY
                  No, no, no. Not you. Your
                  ancestors.

                            DEWDROP
                  What did you say about my
                  ancestors?!

                            BARLEY
                  I didn't mean lazy, I--



 
                                                                       68.


      But Ian swoops in and GRABS Barley while also holding the
      full gas can and a wandering Dad.

                            IAN
                  I'm sorry! Very sorry! He's sorry,
                  too. You don't need to fly, who
                  needs to fly? I mean you've got
                  those great bikes!

                            BARLEY
                  What are you doing? I was just
                  discussing history!

                            IAN
                  Barley, I'm trying to take care of
                  you and Dad, and you are not making
                  it any easier!
                       (struggling with Dad)
                  Dad, come on!

      Dad has wandered to the other side of the line of motorcycles
      and Ian unwittingly pulls him into the bikes. They CRASH like
      dominoes, blocking the gas station door.

                              IAN
                  Oh no.

      The Sprites inside the gas station SLAM into the door and
      windows of the station. They are SEETHING caged animals.

                            DEWDROP
                  HEY! YOU'RE DEAD!

      Ian RACES Dad and Barley out of there as fast as he can.


      EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

      Ian runs, terrified.

                            IAN
                  We're dead! We're dead! We're dead!
                  We're dead! We're dead!

      Ian frantically fills the van with gasoline.

                            BARLEY
                  Relax, they won't be able to lift
                  those bikes--

      One motorcycle ROARS to life in the distance.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, they are strong...


 
                                                                       69.


                            IAN
                  We're gonna die, we're gonna die,
                  we're gonna die!

      Barley jumps up and down on the door handle.

                            BARLEY
                  It's locked!

                            IAN
                  What?! Where are the keys?

      They see the keys still in the ignition.

                            BARLEY
                  I got this!

      Barley slides his tiny body through the cracked window. He
      struggles to try to lift the lock.

                            IAN
                  C'mon, Barley!

      The lock pops up, sending Barley flying backwards.

                              BARLEY
                  Whoa!

      Ian climbs in the passenger side and slams the door.


      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

      Ian points out the windshield.

                            IAN
                  Okay, Go! Go! Go!

      Ian looks at Barley, tiny and useless on the drivers seat.

                            IAN
                  Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No way...

                            BARLEY
                  You're gonna have to!

      Ian slides over into the drivers seat. He carefully buckles
      his seatbelt, but then sees the motorcycles coming. Ian turns
      the key. The engine whines, but nothing happens.

                            IAN
                  Come on, why won't it start?!




 
                                                                      70.


                            BARLEY
                  There's a sweet spot... not in the
                  middle, but not quite at the end!

      Ian wiggles the ignition, leaning into it.

                             IAN
                  Comeoncomeoncomeoncomeon! Come. On.
                  Guinevere!

      The van sputters to life.

                            BARLEY
                  Put it in "O" for "onward!"

      Ian pulls the screwdriver gear shift down to the handwritten
      letter "O". The van lurches forward just as a sprite SMASHES
      out Ian's window with a flail.

                              IAN
                  AHH!

                              BARLEY
                  DRIVE!!!

      Ian's unintentionally cuts off the sprites. Their bikes get
      tangled up as the van speeds away.

      EXT. EXPRESSWAY/INT. VAN - NIGHT

      The van races up the on-ramp onto the expressway.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, you're gonna have to merge!

      Cars ROAR past the van as Ian cautiously picks up speed. A
      huge truck barrels up beside him. Ian tentatively steers the
      van closer to the freeway. The truck lays on its horn.

                              BARLEY
                  Speed up!

                            IAN
                  I can't do this!

                            BARLEY
                  Yes you can!

                            IAN
                  I'm not ready!

                            BARLEY
                  You'll never be ready! MERGE!!



 
                                                                       71.


                              IAN
                  AHHH!!!

      Ian floors it and cuts in front of the giant truck.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! Nice job!

      In the rearview mirror, Ian sees the motorcycles gaining on
      them. They pull up on both sides of the van, surrounding him.

      A biker pulls out a flail and hits the van. Barley leaps up
      to the window, yelling out at the sprites.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey, don't hit Gwinny!

                              IAN
                  Barley!

      Ian quickly comes up behind a slow moving car.

                              IAN
                  Oh, no!

                            BARLEY
                  Get around 'em!

                            IAN
                  They're not letting me in!

                              BARLEY
                  SIGNAL!

                            IAN
                  You don't have a signal-er!

                            BARLEY
                  Stick your arm straight out the
                  window to signal left!

      Ian holds his arm straight out the window. A sprite
      immediately wraps a chain around it.

                              IAN
                  AH!!

      Ian turns the wheel one-handed and merges into the next lane.
      Barley climbs out on Ian's arm to untangle the chain.

                            IAN
                  Get back here!




 
                                                                       72.


                            BARLEY
                  Just keep driving!

      The sprites cheer as they gain on the van.

                              IAN
                  Barley!

      Barley successfully untangles the chain. It recoils and
      almost knocks a number of sprites off their motorcycle.

      Ian looks ahead and sees the freeway splitting EAST and
      NORTH. Barley crawls back onto Ian's shoulder.

                            BARLEY
                  The mountains are north. You need
                  to get all the way over!

      Dad stumbles to the front of the car and face plants into the
      steering wheel, blaring Guinevere's horn.


      EXT. EXPRESSWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Dewdrop sees Dad's body flapping out the window, his stuffed
      arm waving as if he's shaking a fist.

                            DEWDROP
                  What the-- Oh it is on, Shades!
                       (to sprites)
                  Get 'em!

      A motorcycle races up to Ian's window. A group of sprites
      LEAP from their bike and into the van, attacking Ian.


      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

      A sprite tackles Barley. Barley pulls the sword from the hand
      of a nearby bobblehead warrior and brandishes it at the
      sprite. Ian, covered in sprites, causes the van to swerve.

      Barley and his sprite are thrown onto the passenger seat. The
      sprite pins Barley down with the seatbelt buckle.

                            BARLEY
                  Ian! Stay focused!

                              IAN
                  I can't!

                            BARLEY
                  You HAVE to focus or we're all
                  dead!


 
                                                                       73.


      Ian sees the NORTH sign out the window rapidly approaching.

                            BARLEY
                  Just stay cool!

      Ian gets an idea.

      He frantically reaches and turns on the AC. Strong air blasts
      from the vents, blowing the sprites out the windows.

      The sprite that was fighting Barley is blown into the
      windshield of the car behind Guinevere.

      Barley clings to the seatbelt, flapping in the wind.

                            BARLEY
                  Way to go, Guinevere!

      He loses his grip and is suddenly blown out the window. But
      Ian manages to grab him at the last minute.

      The sprites rev their bike for another attack.

                              DEWDROP
                  Hit it!

      Ian sees his exit ahead, across several lanes.

                            BARLEY
                  We're not gonna make it!

      With determination, Ian crosses several lanes of traffic,
      just barely making it onto the NORTH fork of the freeway.

      The sprites don't have time to correct their course. They
      crash their bike and hurtle toward the ground. But their
      wings flap until suddenly... they're flying.

                              DEWDROP
                  Huh.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      Tiny Barley perches on Ian's shoulder, celebrating their
      success. Ian pants heavily, still riding the adrenaline.

                            IAN
                  Dad, are you okay?!

                            BARLEY
                  He's fine, thanks to the skillful
                  driving of Sir Ian Lightfoot! High
                  Five!


 
                                                                       74.


      Barley raises his hand to high five, but it bulges to full
      size and smacks Ian in the face.

                            IAN
                  Ow! What is happening?

                            BARLEY
                  I think the spell is wearing off.

      Barley's torso expands to full size on Ian's shoulder. Ian
      can't even see out the window to know where he's going.

                            IAN
                  Get off my face!

      Barley's right leg grows, slamming onto the gas pedal.


      EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT

      The van lunges forward, swerving past a hidden police car.
      Its lights come on and it gives chase.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      Barley, now fully-grown, climbs into the passenger seat.

                            IAN
                  Oh, Chantar's Talon! Cops!

                               BARLEY
                  Pull over!

                            IAN
                  I don't have a license.

      Barley pulls a small piece of folded leather from his pocket.

                            BARLEY
                  Ah! My wallet's still tiny!


      EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT

      The van pulls over.

      There are two cops in the car behind them. An imposing
      cyclops, OFFICER SPECTER, and a boorish satyr: OFFICER GORE.
      Officer Specter speaks into the P.A.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Step out of the vehicle.



 
                                                                       75.


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      The boys struggle to remain calm.

                            IAN
                  What are we gonna do?

                            BARLEY
                  I don't know!

      In the background, Dad's dizzy legs stumble around, then lean
      against the open back doors of the van and begin to step out.

                            IAN
                  How are we gonna explain--
                       (seeing Dad)
                  Oh no. DAD!


      EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - CONTINUOUS

      The cops watch Dad slowly stumble from the van, then share a
      knowing look. They step out of the car and walk over to Dad.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  You have a long night there, buddy?

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Sir, I'm gonna ask you to walk this
                  straight line.

      Meanwhile, Ian and Barley confer in front of the van.

                            IAN
                  They're gonna take Dad!

      Barley thinks for a moment.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh! I got it! The disguise spell!
                  You can disguise yourself to be
                  anyone you want.

      Barley draws the spell in the dirt.

                            IAN
                  What if I mess up again?

                            BARLEY
                  According to the spell, "Disguising
                  yourself is a lie, so you must tell
                  the truth to get by." As long as
                  you don't tell a lie, the spell
                  will be fine.


 
                                                                       76.


                            IAN
                  Okay... who are we gonna be?

      The cops watch a wandering, meandering Dad.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  Okay, we're taking you down to the
                  station.

      There's a flash followed by the sound of hooves. The cops
      turn to see Officer Colt Bronco walk out from behind the van.

                            COLT
                       (nervous/uncertain)
                  What seems to be the problem here
                  fellow... police folk?

      Colt's back legs walk out of sync, nervous and awkward.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  Officer Bronco?

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Were you in that van?

      To the side of Colt we see a new point of view: The boys are
      masked by a ghost-like shell of Colt, Ian in the front,
      Barley in the back. We hear Colt's voice turn into Ian's.

                            COLT/IAN
                  Affirmative! And we will, I mean, I
                  will take full responsibility for
                  that fella right there, so you can
                  just release him over to me.

                            BARLEY
                       (whispered to Ian)
                  Hey, I wanted to be the front.

                            IAN
                       (whispered to Barley)
                  No way, I'll do the talking.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  Bronco, I thought you were working
                  on the other side of town.

                            COLT
                  I, uh, changed my mind.

      Suddenly Colt's right ear vanishes. Ian quickly turns,
      blocking the missing ear from view.




 
                                                                    77.


                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Something wrong?

                            COLT
                       (panicking)
                  Just a little... neck... cramp!

      And with that, Colt's left hand goes away. Ian quickly and
      awkwardly bends his arm behind his body.

                            BARLEY
                       (whispered, to Ian)
                  You have to stop lying. Answer
                  every question with a question!

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  What exactly are you doing out
                  here?

                            COLT
                  Uh... What am I doing out here?
                  What are any of us doing out here?

                             OFFICER GORE
                  Whoa... I never thought about it
                  like that.

                               BARLEY
                          (whispered, to Ian)
                  Nice!

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  With all due respect, you didn't
                  answer my question.

                            COLT
                  Well, we were just exercising some
                  driver's education drills for...
                  Ian.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Who is Ian?

                            OFFICER GORE
                       (pointing back to Dad)
                  Oh, is that Laurel's kid?

                            COLT
                  Ian is Laurel's kid.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Your stepson was swerving all over
                  the road.



 
                                                                       78.


                            COLT/IAN
                  Yeah, well... that guy's not all
                  there today.

      They all look to see Dad slump on the hood of the police car.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Yeah, he does seem a little off.
                       (suspicious)
                  You seem a little off yourself.

      Behind the illusion, Ian is nervous and sweating.

                            IAN/COLT
                  Uh, actually, if I'm being
                  completely honest... I'm not super
                  great in this kinda situation...
                  and I'm starting to freak out a
                  little bit. I'm all sweaty and
                  weird and I don't know what to say
                  and I just feel like I can't do
                  anything right and I'm a total
                  weirdo--

      Specter and Gore share a look. Specter takes Colt aside.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Whoa, whoa, hold on, okay hold on,
                  hold on. I think I know what's
                  going on here.

                            IAN
                  Uh... You do?

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Yeah, it's not easy being a new
                  parent. My girlfriend's daughter
                  got me pulling my hair out, okay?

                            IAN
                       (relieved)
                  Oh... uh, yeah.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                       (to Gore)
                  Alright, we can let him go.

                            COLT
                  Oh, okay... I'm just gonna take him
                  to the van.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Hey, it gets better, alright? Good
                  luck, Bronco.


 
                                                                     79.


                            COLT
                  You too, Officer. Keep workin'
                  hard... or hardly workin'...
                       (horse laugh)

      The boys, still disguised as Colt, put Dad back in the van.

                            BARLEY
                       (whispering)
                  Now that was a good Colt!

      Ian grins at Barley.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  I don't envy you, Bronco. That
                  Lightfoot kid is a handful.

                            COLT
                  I'm gonna have to disagree with you
                  there, I think Ian's a pretty stand
                  up citizen.

                            OFFICER GORE
                  Not him, the older one.

                               IAN
                  What?

                            OFFICER GORE
                  I mean, the guy's a screw up. You
                  can't say you don't agree?

                            IAN
                  Um... I don't.

      Colt's right leg instantly vanishes. Right in front of
      Barley's face.

                               BARLEY
                          (hurt, stunned)
                  What?

                            IAN/COLT
                  I mean, um, uh, okay, well, um, I
                  have to get going, gotta get Ian
                  home.

      Colt's other arm vanishes. Ian quickly shuffles back to the
      van. The cops watch, baffled by Colt's behavior.

                            COLT
                  Ah, I mean, I'm late for work.

      Colt's back legs vanish.


 
                                                                       80.


                            COLT/IAN
                  Sorry, I mean I'm feeling a little
                  sick. I mean, tired. Sick and
                  tired. I gotta go! See you Monday!

      With each lie, Colt loses an arm, leg, ear. Ian and Barley
      just barely slink into the van before Colt's head disappears.

                            OFFICER GORE
                       (laughing)
                  Oh man, Bronco is losing it. See,
                  that's why I never got married.
                  Yup, Old Gore can't be tied down.

      Specter watches the van drive away. Then she CLICKS on her
      flashlight and follows Colt's hoof prints in the dirt, only
      to find them eventually lead to regular shoe prints.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                       (into her radio)
                  This is Specter. Can you put me
                  through to Officer Colt Bronco?


      INT. VAN - NIGHT

      The boys drive down the highway, silent. Ian looks straight
      ahead, guilty. Barley stares at the road, stone-faced.

                            IAN
                  Barley... I don't know what
                  happened back there, but I don't
                  think you're a screwup.

      Barley says nothing.

                            IAN
                  Maybe the magic just got it
                  wrong... you know?

                              BARLEY
                  Yeah...

      Barley BLASTS super loud fantasy metal. Ian winces.

                            IAN
                  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED--

      Barley turns up the music louder.

                            IAN
                  BARLEY! BARLEY!




 
                                                                    81.


      Suddenly Barley whips off the road at a rest area. He gets
      out of the van through the side door.


      EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT

      The music blares as Barley marches away from the van. He
      angrily tears into a bag of Gorgon-Zola's Cheese Puffs.

                            IAN
                  Where are you going?

      Ian follows after him, calling out.

                            IAN
                  Barley, come on, this is all just--

      Barley stops and turns to Ian.

                            BARLEY
                  I'm not a screwup!

                            IAN
                  I didn't say you were.

                            BARLEY
                  The magic said it for you!

                            IAN
                  Well, the magic got it wrong!

                            BARLEY
                  Magic doesn't get it wrong! The cop
                  asked a question, you answered, and
                  magic revealed the truth. Right?!
                       (beat)
                  RIGHT?!

                            IAN
                  I don't know how any of this stuff
                  works! All I know is that
                  everything we've done tonight has
                  gone wrong!

                            BARLEY
                  It's gone wrong because you won't
                  listen to me!

      Ian stops, stunned.

                            IAN
                  Are you kidding? Because everything
                  we've done has been your idea--



 
                                                                       82.


                            BARLEY
                  But you didn't do it my way! You
                  didn't let me handle the Manticore.
                  You freaked out when I talked to
                  the sprites. Because you don't
                  think I have good ideas.

                            IAN
                  What! Of course I do!

                            BARLEY
                  Great, then I think we should take
                  the Path of Peril!

                            IAN
                  And I also think that would be
                  good... normally--

                              BARLEY
                  See!

                            IAN
                  But I told you, this isn't a game!
                  All that matters today is Dad, and
                  right now he's sitting in that van,
                  and he's confused--

      Barley looks over Ian's shoulder back toward the van.

                              IAN
                  What?!

      Ian turns to see Dad standing in the back of the van, bending
      his knees to the music.

                            IAN
                  What is he doing?

                            BARLEY
                  I think he can feel the vibrations
                  of the music and he's... dancing.

      The boys watch as Dad slowly adds more dance moves. Then Dad
      really cuts loose and it's... not good.

                            IAN
                  Wow. He is terrible.

      Dad flails so wildly that his top half falls off.

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah. He's really, really bad.

      They watch in embarrassment. Dad shimmies over to the boys.


 
                                                                       83.


                            BARLEY
                  Oh no, here he comes.

      Dad hooks his leg around Barley's, cajoling him to dance.

                            BARLEY
                  No no no, thanks Dad. Dad, thank
                  you! I'm good! Stop!
                       (laugh)
                  Okay, okay!

      Ian watches Barley and Dad dance. Then Dad walks over to Ian.

                            IAN
                  Oh! No, no, no. No, no, no! I'm not
                  really a big dancer--

      Ian tries to get away, but Dad won't have it. Ian is forced
      to dance. The boys both dance with Dad.

                            IAN
                  Just imagine what the top half of
                  this dance looks like.

                            BARLEY
                  I bet it goes something like this!

      Barley dances wildly behind Dad, mimicking Dad's upper half
      for a moment. The boys laugh.

      The music stops. Dad sits.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, you danced your shoelaces loose
                  there, Pop.

      Barley kneels to tie Dad's shoe. Then speaks to Ian without
      looking at him.

                            BARLEY
                  You know, I want to see him, too.

                            IAN
                  Yeah... I know.

      Barley stands.

                            BARLEY
                  It's not fair for you to call me a
                  screwup if you don't give me a
                  chance to get something right. Just
                  do one thing my way.

      This hits Ian.


 
                                                                     84.


                            IAN
                  You really think this "Path of
                  Peril" is the best way to go to the
                  mountain?

      Barley nods. Ian looks uncertain, then...

                              IAN
                  Okay.

      Barley smiles.


      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

      The van drives down the road, then veers onto a dusty,
      unpaved path. The roughness of the road causes Guinevere's
      back bumper to fall off, license plate and all.

      The van drives away into the distance.


      EXT. GRECKLIN'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

      The Manticore and Laurel climb out of the car.

                            LAUREL
                  Uh, so where is your magic sword?

                            MANTICORE
                  It lies beyond those gates.

      The MANTICORE looks toward a small building with a flashing
      sign that reads: PAWN SHOP.

                            MANTICORE
                  If we don't leave here with the
                  sword, your boys are doomed.


      INT. GRECKLIN'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

      A dirty pawn shop filled with old junk, TV's, microwaves as
      well as antiques, fantasy armor, instruments, and books.

      The pawnshop's owner, GRECKLIN, a grizzled, lanky goblin,
      lays a large garlic press in front of them.

                            GRECKLIN
                  There you are, one garlic crusher.

                            MANTICORE
                  No, Curse Crusher. It's a large
                  magical sword.


 
                                                                     85.


      Grecklin looks through junk behind the counter.

                            GRECKLIN
                  Sword, sword, sword...

      She holds up a giant, glorious sword.

                            GRECKLIN
                  I mean, I got this thing.

                               MANTICORE
                  That's it!

                               LAUREL
                  How much?

                            GRECKLIN
                  Let's call it, uh... ten.

                               LAUREL
                  Great!

      Laurel counts the money. The Manticore speaks to her sword.

                            MANTICORE
                  Forged of the rarest metals, the
                  only sword of its kind in all the
                  land. Hello, old friend. We shall
                  never part again.

      Grecklin slams her hand on the sword.

                               GRECKLIN
                  Oops.
                       (to Laurel)
                  Turns out this sword is the only
                  sword of its kind in all the land.
                  So, let's call it ten... thousand.

                            LAUREL
                  You can't do that!

                            GRECKLIN
                  Well, I just did.

                            LAUREL
                  Well you had better--

      Laurel's phone rings. She steps away to answer it.

                               LAUREL
                  Yeah.




 
                                                                       86.


                            COLT (O.S.)
                  Hey, I talked to some other
                  officers and they said the boys
                  were last seen going north.

                            LAUREL
                  Are they okay?

                            COLT (O.S.)
                  They're fine, but the officers
                  said, well... honey, this night
                  keeps getting stranger and
                  stranger.

      Laurel looks over to see the Manticore and Grecklin arguing.

                            MANTICORE
                  Do you know who I am?

                            GRECKLIN
                  Some kind of winged bear-snake
                  lady?

                            MANTICORE
                  Winged lion-scorpion lady!

      Back on Laurel.

                            LAUREL
                  It sure does.

      Laurel walks over to Grecklin and the Manticore, putting down
      her phone for a moment.

                             LAUREL
                        (angry)
                  Listen, I need that sword. My sons
                  have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to
                  see their father. Now, my oldest
                  son--

      The Manticore's tail suddenly STRIKES Grecklin in the neck.
      Grecklin's eyes POP openand she falls to the ground.

                            LAUREL
                  HOLY- SON OF- YOU KILLED HER!

                             MANTICORE
                  It's okay! She's only temporarily
                  paralyzed.

      On the other side of the counter, Grecklin lies motionless.




 
                                                                 87.


                            GRECKLIN
                  HEY! You can't do this!

                            MANTICORE
                  Well, I just did.

      Laurel considers this for a moment.

                            LAUREL
                  Grab the sword!

                            GRECKLIN
                  Don't you touch that!

      The Manticore grabs the Curse Crusher from the counter.
      Laurel delicately puts some cash on the counter.

                            LAUREL
                       (nervous/polite)
                  Here you go. And a little something
                  extra for your trouble.
                       (backing to the door)
                  I love your store! Oh, that's so
                  pretty.

      Laurel flips the sign to "CLOSED" and exits.

                               GRECKLIN
                  Hey! HEY!


      EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

      Laurel and the Manticore run to the car with the sword.

                               MANTICORE
                  Ohhh yeah!

                            COLT (ON PHONE)
                  Laurel?! What's happening?!

      Back on Colt, who looks panicked.

                            COLT (ON PHONE)
                  Hello? Are you alright?! Laurel!

                            LAUREL
                       (phone to ear)
                  Oh Colt, I can't talk! The boys
                  need me!

      And she hangs up on Colt.




 
                                                                       88.


      INT. COLT'S CAR - NIGHT

                            COLT
                  Wait! Dang those kids.

      Just then, Colt sees a bumper at the head of a rough path. He
      shines his flashlight onto the plate reading "GWNIVER".

      Colt's hoof HITS the gas.


      EXT. COLT'S CAR - NIGHT

      Colt's car speeds down the path into the distance.


      EXT. ANCIENT TRAIL - DAY

      Adventurous fantasy music swells in the sunrise as Guinevere
      traverses the uneven trail.


      INT. VAN - DAY

                            BARLEY
                       (singing)
                  We're heading on our quest, our
                  father we must retrieve, the
                  Lightfoot Brothers can't be
                  stopped... something, something
                  that rhymes with retrieved!

      A bump jostles Ian awake in back. Dad also wakes up in a
      panic. He taps Ian's foot.

                            IAN
                  Yeah, we're still here.

      Dad goes to the front and taps his foot against Barley.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, good morning to thee, dear
                  Lightfoot men! Welcome to the Path
                  of Peril!

      Ian looks out the window at a desolate field.

                            IAN
                  It's not much of a path.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, you know, they never really
                  developed around here. So heads up,
                  we could run into anything.
                            (MORE)

 
                                                                      89.

                            BARLEY (CONT'D)
                  A centicore, a wolf dragon,
                  gelatinous cube...

                            IAN
                  Okay, what is a gelatinous cube?

      Barley turns to Ian, taking his eyes off the road.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, it's a giant green cube that
                  instantly disintegrates all that it
                  touches!

                            IAN
                  We're not going to run into a--
                       (looking ahead)
                  WHOA, STOP!!

      Barley SLAMS on the brakes. The van comes to a screeching
      halt at the edge of a chasm.


      EXT. BOTTOMLESS PIT - DAY

      The boys step out of the van. Ian holds Dad's leash.

                            IAN
                  What is this?

                            BARLEY
                  Bottomless pit. Whatever falls in
                  there, falls forever.

      Ian peers over. He doesn't notice Dad wander right to the
      edge. Ian pulls him back at the last minute.

                            IAN
                  Whoa, Dad, come here.

      Ian walks Dad back the van and places him in the front seat.

                            BARLEY
                  Ian, check it out. This is an
                  ancient drawbridge! We lower that
                  bad boy and we are on our way to
                  Raven's Point. Look around for a
                  lever.

      Ian points.

                            IAN
                  Found it! But, it's on the other
                  side.



 
                                                                     90.


      Ian gets an idea. He lifts the staff.

                            IAN
                  Okay, I got this. Aloft Elevar.

      Magic shoots from the staff, but peters out halfway across.

                            BARLEY
                  You can't cast a levitation spell
                  on something that far away! It only
                  has like a 15-meter enchanting
                  radius.
                       (nerdy laugh)
                  Dad, can you believe this guy?
                       (beat)
                  What we need is a Trust Bridge.
                  It's a spell that creates a magical
                  bridge you can walk on. Just say
                  "Bridgrigar Invisia."

                              IAN
                  Okay...

      Ian walks to the lip of the chasm and holds out his staff.

                            IAN
                  Bridgrigar Invisia.

      The staff lights up, but no bridge. Ian looks at Barley.

                            IAN
                  It didn't work.

                            BARLEY
                  No, the spell's still going. You
                  won't know if your bridge worked
                  until you step on it.

                            IAN
                  Step on what?

                            BARLEY
                  If you believe the bridge is there,
                  then it's there.

                            IAN
                  But it's not.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, not with that attitude.

      Ian gestures to the empty air over the chasm.




 
                                                                      91.


                            IAN
                  I'm not going to step out onto
                  nothing!

      Barley considers this, then gets an idea.

                                                   CUT TO:

      Barley ties a rope to a large rock. The other end is tied
      around Ian's waist. Barley holds the rope in the middle.

                            BARLEY
                  Now we've got a rope. But you're
                  not even going to need it because--

                            IAN
                  I WANT THE ROPE!

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, I'm just saying, you're not
                  gonna need the rope because I know
                  you can make that bridge.

      Ian takes a deep breath and gathers himself. He takes a big
      step and... FALLS over the edge.

                              IAN
                  Agh!

      Barley pulls the rope and stops Ian's fall.

                            IAN
                  I'm dying, I'm dying! I'm dead! I'm
                  dead! I'm dead! Oh, my life is
                  over!

                            BARLEY
                  I've got you!

      Barley pulls Ian up, scraping him along the rocks and roots
      of the chasm. When he gets to the top, Barley dusts him off.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, you fell. But was that so
                  bad?

                              IAN
                  YES!

                            BARLEY
                  Are you still alive?




 
                                                                       92.


                               IAN
                          (reluctant)
                  Yes.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, so now you know the worst
                  that can happen. So there's nothing
                  to be scared of, right?

      Ian thinks about this and looks across the chasm. He takes a
      breath and repositions himself at the edge.

                            IAN
                  Bridgrigar Invisia!

      The staff glows. Ian looks at the chasm, then back at Barley.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey. You can do this.

      He STEPS off the edge. But this time his foot stops mid-air,
      planted on a glowing platform of light.

                               BARLEY
                  Ha-ha!

                               IAN
                  Yeah!

                            BARLEY
                  THERE YOU GO!

      Ian stands there for a moment, one-legged, then plants his
      other foot. But this foot doesn't land on anything.

      Barley gives a tug on the rope and pulls him back.

                            BARLEY
                  Believe with every step!

      Ian closes his eyes, concentrates, then LANDS it on another
      platform of light.

                               BARLEY
                  Oh yeah!

      Ian takes another step. It lands, solid. He takes another few
      steps and calls back to Barley.

                            IAN
                  You've got me, right?




 
                                                                       93.


                            BARLEY
                  I still got you! WOOHOO! Ian
                  Lightfoot is FEARLESS!

      Ian takes one step after another to the center of the chasm.

      But the knot in the rope loosens. Barley's eyes go wide.

                            IAN
                  This is amazing!

      The rope loosens more and more, until it falls free, dropping
      into the chasm.

                            BARLEY
                       (covering panic)
                  Yeah, but just keep going! Don't
                  look back! Just straight ahead!

                            IAN
                       (laughing)
                  You've still got the rope, right?

      Barley looks at the useless rope in his hands.

                            BARLEY
                  YEAH! I GOT IT!

                            IAN
                  I AM NOT AFRAID!
                       (beat)
                  Oh man, I could stay out here all
                  day!

      Ian playfully steps from side to side.

                            BARLEY
                  OKAY, BUT KEEP MOVING! WE'VE GOTTA
                  SEE DAD, REMEMBER?!

      Ian approaches the other side of the chasm.

                            IAN
                  HEY DAD, THIS LAST STEP IS FOR YOU!

      Ian turns to look at Barley and Dad. When he does, he sees
      the rope isn't attached to him anymore.

      As soon as he sees this, he FALLS.

      But just catches himself on the lip of the chasm. He pulls
      himself up, terrified, and leans against the bridge lever.
      The bridge lowers, loud and creaky.



 
                                                                      94.


                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! He did it, Dad!

      Barley drives across the bridge and gets out to hug Ian.

                            BARLEY
                  That was amazing!

                            IAN
                  How long... was the rope gone?

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, just like the second half of
                  it.

                            IAN
                  I needed that rope!

                            BARLEY
                       (smiling)
                  Oh, but did you?


      EXT. DRAWBRIDGE - DAY

      Ian thinks about this. He looks back at the chasm and smiles
      faintly at his success.

                               BARLEY (O.S.)
                  Ian! Look.

      Barley points to the top of the drawbridge structure.

                            BARLEY
                  It's a raven.

      Barley takes out the wrinkled children's menu.

                            BARLEY
                  The clue on the menu said Raven's
                  Point...

      Ian points to the mountains in the distance.

                            IAN
                  Yeah. In the mountains.

                             BARLEY
                  But maybe the puzzle didn't mean
                  the mountain. Maybe it means
                  "follow where the raven is
                  pointing!"




 
                                                                       95.


      Barley follows the line of the raven's beak to a stone
      structure in the distance: Another raven.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! It's another raven! That one
                  could be pointing to another raven,
                  all the way to the gem!

      Ian looks at the mountains, horrified.

                            IAN
                  I had us going the wrong way.

                            BARLEY
                  Well, I told ya. My gut knows where
                  to go.
                       (to his gut)
                  Don't ya, boy? Yes you do!

      Barley pats his gut and laughs proudly.

      Ian looks at Barley, impressed.

      Barley grabs Dad and heads to the van.

                            BARLEY
                       (shaking his keys)
                  Come on, Dad! Guinevere will get us
                  to that raven in no time.

      Suddenly, a POLICE SIREN. A police car crosses the bridge and
      screeches to a halt in front of them. Colt gets out of his
      car, struggling to pull his rear end out the door.

                            COLT
                  You guys are in trouble, big time!

                            BARLEY
                  No, no, no, Colt, we found a spell.
                  If we finish it before sunset,
                  we'll get to see our father.

      Barley removes Dad's torso. Colt looks confused.

                            COLT
                  Well, uh, your mom told me there
                  was some kind of strange family
                  issue going on and this is...
                  definitely strange.
                       (resetting)
                  But no, dang it. I'm not letting
                  you upset your mother anymore! Now,
                  you get in the vehicle, I'm
                  escorting you home.


 
                                                                      96.


                            BARLEY
                  No, no way!

                            COLT
                  I'm giving you to the count of
                  three.

      Colt stops his hoof once... then twice... then...

                            IAN
                  Okay. We'll go.

      Ian grabs the van keys from Barley.

                               BARLEY
                  Ian--

                            IAN
                  He's a police officer.

      Ian turns and heads toward the driver's side of the van.


      INT. VAN - DAY

      Barley climbs in and looks at Ian behind the wheel.

                            BARLEY
                  What are you doing?

                            IAN
                  I don't know.

      Ian HITS the gas.


      EXT. DRAWBRIDGE - DAY

      The van takes off, Colt runs after it.

                               COLT
                  Son of a--

      Colt runs after the van. Exhausted, he talks into his radio.

                            COLT
                  I need backup. Runaway van!


      INT. VAN - DAY

      Barley looks behind them, celebrating.




 
                                                                       97.


                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha, YEAH! Iandore Lightfoot,
                  breaking the rules!

      Ian keeps his eyes locked on the road, focused and frazzled.

                            IAN
                  I can't believe I'm running from
                  the cops!

                             BARLEY
                  You're not running from the cops,
                  you're running from our mom's
                  boyfriend.

      Suddenly, a squadron of police cars come straight at them.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, now you're running from the
                  cops.

      The cops approach from both directions. Ian whips Guinevere
      into a fishtail, drops the hammer, and evades the cops.

      Out the window, Ian spots the raven statue in the distance.
      He cranks the wheel toward it, down a narrow, unpaved road.

                              IAN
                  Hold on!

      Guinevere skids around an unbelievably tight turn at the edge
      of a cliff. Ian pats Guinevere's dash board, encouragingly.

                            IAN
                  Yeah! Nice going, Guinevere!
                  Woohoo!

      The road comes to a dead end. Ian turns the van around, but
      they see the cop cars coming up the narrow mountain pass.

      Ian gets out of the van.

                            IAN
                  Oh, what did I do?! I shouldn't
                  have driven away--

                            BARLEY
                  No, it was great!

      Barley points to boulders at the top of the narrow pass.

                            BARLEY
                  Hey! Block the road with those
                  boulders!


 
                                                                      98.


                            IAN
                  What?! How?!

                            BARLEY
                  Arcane Lightning.

                            IAN
                  You said that's the hardest spell.

                            BARLEY
                  You're ready.

      Barley hands Ian the book and points to the spell.

                            BARLEY
                  "To make lightning strike with
                  ease, one must follow all decrees."
                       (beat)
                  You have to do everything. Speak
                  from your heart's fire, trust
                  yourself, focus, all of it!

      Ian picks up the staff and points it at the boulders.

                            IAN
                  Voltar Thundasir.

      A tiny bit of electricity glows in his staff, but quickly
      peters out. He tries again.

                            IAN
                  Voltar Thundasir.

      The staff glows again, but quickly fades. Ian points the
      staff at the boulders again.

                            IAN
                  Voltar Thundasir.

      The magic gives out.

                            IAN
                  I can't, I can't do it!

      Ian sighs and turns to Barley and Dad.

                            IAN
                  We're not gonna see you, Dad. And
                  it's all my fault.

      Barley sees how upset Ian is. He turns, starts up Guinevere,
      and puts in a tape labelled RISE TO VALHALLA. Sad, heroic,
      music blares.



 
                                                                       99.


                            IAN
                  What are you doing?

      Barley aligns the steering wheel, puts a rock on the gas
      pedal, knocks the gear shift to "O."

      Then watches her go.

      Her turn signal pops out and falls to the ground.

      The glove compartment pops open and parking violations fly
      out the windows.

      Barley salutes her.

      She rides up the edge of the narrow pass, SLAMS into the
      rocks, flips onto her back in the middle of the road, and is
      covered by boulders... completely blocking the road.

      The police can't get through.

                               COLT
                  What the--

      Barley picks up Guinevere's turn signal light, gives it a
      loving rub, and puts it in his pocket.

                               IAN
                  Barley...

                            BARLEY
                  She was just a beat up old van.
                  Come on, we gotta go.

      Barley ducks under the guard rail and walks through the brush
      with Dad. Ian climbs the guard rail and follows.

      We see the boys walk off toward the lowering sun.


      EXT. FANTASY WILDERNESS - DAY

      The boys and Dad walk through tall fields, steady and somber.

      They reach the raven. It points to another distant raven.

      They walk toward that raven, through the rain.

      They reach the raven, follow its beak, and walk further on.




 
                                                                       100.


      EXT. RIVER - DAY

      The beak of the next raven points straight at a metal disk on
      the ground. Barley begins to pry it up.

                              IAN
                  Wait.

      Ian wipes dirt from the disk. They see the reflection of the
      raven's beak pointing back at the chest of the raven statue.

      Ian goes to the statue, examines the chest, and pulls out a
      loose tile with a distinctive shape.

                            BARLEY
                  You see that, Dad? The apprentice
                  has become the master.

      Barley takes a closer look at the tile. There's a
      hieroglyphic engraved in it: wavy lines that lead to an "X".

                            BARLEY
                  It looks like... water.

      They look around and see a river flowing into a tunnel. They
      give each other an excited glance.


      EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY

                            IAN
                  So what's the X mean?

                            BARLEY
                  On a quest, an X only means one
                  thing. We go to the end of the
                  water, we'll find that Phoenix Gem.


      INT. TUNNEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Ian creates a magic flame to light a torch.

      The light reveals horrific, rat-like unicorns that HISS.

                              IAN
                  AH! Ugh!

                              BARLEY
                  Ugh!

      They flap their horrible wings and flutter out of the tunnel.




 
                                                                       101.


                            IAN
                  Unicorns! Ugh!

      The boys and Dad climb deeper into the tunnel, along the
      river. Barley snacks on cheese puffs. Ian looks up to see
      ancient paintings adorning the walls.

                              BARLEY
                  Cool...

      Ian holds up the torch to try to see the end of the tunnel.
      It just disappears into endless darkness.

                            IAN
                  This water could go on for miles.
                  We don't have that kind of time.

                            BARLEY
                  If we had something to float on we
                  could cast a velocity spell on it.
                  Fly down the tunnel like a magic
                  jet ski.

      Ian looks around.

                            IAN
                  There's not much to float on.

                            BARLEY
                  Remember, on a quest you have to
                  use what you've got.

      Barley looks at the cheese puff he's about to eat.

                                                   CUT TO:

                            IAN
                  Magnora Gantuan!

      A FLASH. Then Ian, Barley, and Dad float into frame riding on
      a GIANT cheese puff. Ian wields the staff.

                              IAN
                  Accelior!

      The cheese puff races into the darkness of the tunnel.

                            IAN
                  This is actually kinda cool! So,
                  what other spells do you know?




 
                                                                      102.


                            BARLEY
                  Oh, brace yourself, young mage! I
                  can show you all there is to know
                  of magic!


      INT. LAUREL'S CAR - DAY

      The Manticore holds the Curse Crusher sword and downs an
      energy drink. Laurel drives and calls Colt.

                            LAUREL
                  Colt, we know where the boys are
                  going, we just have to get to them
                  before they unleash the curse!

                              COLT (ON PHONE)
                  The what?

                            MANTICORE
                  Let's CRUSH some curses!

      She slams the energy drink and tosses it over her shoulder.

                            LAUREL
                  The curse! The curse that protects
                  the gem by turning into a rock
                  dragon or something--

                            COLT (ON PHONE)
                  A what dragon?!

                            LAUREL
                  I can't explain it I just know we
                  have to get to the boys, fast!

      The Manticore cracks open another energy drink.

                            MANTICORE
                  Oh, we'll get them FAST, we'll get
                  to them SO FAST!

      Laurel takes the energy drink from the Manticore, shakes her
      head, and pours the rest out the window.

                            COLT (ON PHONE)
                  Well, I almost had them, but Ian,
                  he just... drove off.

                            LAUREL
                  Huh? Good for him.

                              COLT (ON PHONE)
                  What?


 
                                                                        103.


                            LAUREL
                  No, I just mean... he's scared to
                  drive. Thinks something's gonna
                  come at him out of the--

      A flying SPRITE hits the windshield.

                   LAUREL                             MANTICORE
      Ahhh!                                Ahhh!

                COLT (O.S.)                        WINDSHIELD SPRITE
      Ahhh!                                Ahhh!

      Laurel can't see. She turns on the windshield wipers in the
      chaos, then steers the car off the road, into a ditch.

      She and the Manticore get out of the car, dazed. We can hear
      Colt's muffled voice inside.

                            COLT (ON PHONE)
                  Laurel, what happened?! What's
                  going on?

      The Sprite peels herself off of the windshield.

                            WINDSHIELD SPRITE
                  You almost killed me, lady!

                            LAUREL
                  Are you okay? Where did you come
                  from?

      Suddenly, a swarm of sprites flies in.

                            DEWDROP
                  You were in our flight path!

                            FLYING SPRITES
                  Yeah! Come on! / Watch where you're
                  going! / Are you alright?

                              WINDSHIELD SPRITE
                  I'm fine.

      The Manticore looks at the demolished car.

                            MANTICORE
                  Oh, no! Our transport! How are we
                  going to get to your sons now?

      Laurel looks around for any sign of hope.




 
                                                                      104.


                             DEWDROP
                  Come on Pixie Dusters, lets take to
                  the skies!

      Laurel   watches the sprites fly away and gets an idea.

                            LAUREL
                  How do you feel about exercising
                  those wings?

      The Manticore gives her wings a nervous flutter.


      INT. TUNNEL - DAY

      Ian stands in the speeding cheese puff, holding the staff.

                            IAN
                  Boombastia!

      Just a small spark. Barley adjust Ian's shoulder like he did
      with the growth spell.

                            BARLEY
                  Remember...

                             IAN
                  Ah, right.
                       (trying again)
                  Boombastia!

      Beautiful fireworks explode from the staff.

                              IAN
                  Whoa!

                            BARLEY
                  Yeah! You're a natural!

      Barley grabs a chunk of cheese doodle and THROWS it at Ian.

                            BARLEY
                  Think fast!

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar!

      Ian catches it with magic.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! Yeah!

      He tosses it back to Barley who pops it in his mouth.



 
                                                                    105.


                              BARLEY
                  Nice!

      Barley eats another fist-sized chunk of the cheese doodle.

                            IAN
                  Careful how much boat you're eating
                  there, man, we still gotta make it
                  to the end of the tunnel.

                            BARLEY
                  Good point.

                            IAN
                  I can't believe I'm this close to
                  actually talking to Dad.

                            BARLEY
                  You know what I'm gonna ask him? If
                  he ever gave himself a wizard name.

                              IAN
                  What?

                            BARLEY
                  Well, `cause he was into magic.
                  Lots of wizards have cool names:
                  Alora the Majestic, Birdar the
                  Fanciful.
                       (beat)
                  Anyway, it'll just be nice to have
                  more than four memories of him.

                            IAN
                       (correcting)
                  Three.

                              BARLEY
                  Hmm?

                            IAN
                  You only have three memories.

                              BARLEY
                  Oh. Yeah.

                            IAN
                  Barley, do you have another memory
                  of Dad you haven't told me?

      Barley pauses, a little pained.

                            BARLEY
                  It's... it's just not my favorite.


 
                                                                       106.


                            IAN
                  What do you mean?

      Barley gives Ian a side glance, hesitant to start.

                            BARLEY
                  When Dad was sick...
                       (beat)
                  I was supposed to go in and say
                  goodbye to him. But he was hooked
                  up to all these tubes and... he
                  just didn't look like himself. I
                  got scared.
                       (beat)
                  And I didn't go in.
                       (resolute)
                  But that's when I decided, I was
                  never gonna be scared ever again.

      Ian smiles, bittersweet.

      Barley looks ahead and points.

                             BARLEY
                  Ah, looks like we're coming up on
                  something.

      The walls of the cavern grow ornate, wizard statues guard the
      tunnel. The boat slows and stops at the edge of a landing.

      The boys and Dad approach an ancient, ornate archway.

                            BARLEY
                       (in awe)
                  The final gauntlet. The Phoenix Gem
                  is just on the other side.


      INT. GAUNTLET - DAY

      Ian enters the tunnel. Dad walks just ahead of him on the
      leash. Barley notices skeletons up ahead.

                            BARLEY
                  Careful, there could be booby
                  traps.

                             IAN
                  This place is, like, a thousand
                  years old. There's no way there
                  could be--

      A blade swings from the wall, cutting off Dad's torso and
      flinging it behind them. A gust blows out Barley's torch.


 
                                                                       107.


      Behind them, a trap door in the ceiling slowly opens, casting
      a sickly green light into the tunnel.

                            BARLEY
                  Oh no, it can't be...

      A giant GELATINOUS CUBE filled with skeletons drops from a
      hole in the ceiling, closing them off from the way they came.

                            BARLEY
                  A GELATINOUS CUBE!

      The cube moves toward them. As it does, it runs over Dad's
      dismembered torso. The torso immediately dissolves.

      They look to the other end of the tunnel and see a door
      slowly lowering from above, about to close them off inside
      the chamber with the gelatinous cube.

                              BARLEY
                  Run!

      Ian sees there are shapes and symbols on the path stones.

                            IAN
                  Whoa, wait! It's some kind of
                  puzzle. We gotta figure it out
                  before--

                            BARLEY
                  No time. Grab a shield.

      Barley and Ian grab shields from skeletons and RUN.

      As they step on path stones, arrows release from the walls
      and strike the shields. At the other side, they STOP in front
      of a wide chasm with spikes at the bottom.

                              IAN
                  Jump!

                              BARLEY
                  What?

                              IAN
                  Trust me.

      Barley jumps and begins to fall toward the spikes.

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar!

      Ian catches Barley in mid-air with a levitation spell.



 
                                                                       108.


                              BARLEY
                  Ha-ha!

      Ian and Dad leap off the edge, using Barley as a stepping
      stone to bound to the other side.

                              BARLEY
                  Ow! Hey!

      Ian lands on the other side and looks back.

                              BARLEY
                  Ian...

      The cube is closing in on Barley, who floats over the chasm.
      Ian uses magic to lift Barley to safety, just barely sliding
      him up between the gelatinous cube and the ledge.

      Ian and Barley slide under the closing door, then notice Dad
      is still on the other side. Ian grabs his leash and tugs him
      under the door just as it closes.

      Ian stands and starts to move forward, but Barley stops him.

                            BARLEY
                  Whoa whoa whoa!

      Barley points at the floor. There's a star-shaped tile on the
      floor, similar to the ones in the gauntlet.

                            BARLEY
                  Don't step on that.

      There's a clanging noise, slow and deep. Suddenly water
      RUSHES into the silo from holes at the bottom. It quickly
      lifts them off their feet, toward the ceiling.

                            IAN
                  I didn't touch it!

      Barley holds onto Dad, trying to keep him above water with
      them. Ian aims the staff at a hole at the top of the silo.

                            IAN
                  Voltar Thundasir!

      A lightning bolt shoots forth, bouncing off the door.

      As they get closer to the top, they can see the hole the
      light is coming through is star-shaped. Ian sticks his head
      underwater and looks at star-shaped stone on the floor.




 
                                                                       109.


                            IAN
                  The tile down there has the same
                  shape as the opening!

                            BARLEY
                  Maybe we were supposed to step on
                  it?

                              IAN
                  What?!

                              BARLEY
                  I got it!

                            IAN
                  No, Barley!

      Barley swims to the bottom of the silo. He STANDS on the
      stone and the door above them begins to open.

                            IAN
                  It's working!

      But Barley can't hold his breath long enough. He swims back
      to the surface and the door quickly closes

                             BARLEY
                  It's impossible!
                        (gasping for air)
                  No one can hold their breath that
                  long!

      Ian and Barley look at each other, then at Dad. Ian lets go
      of Dad, letting him sink to the bottom. Ian guides Dad toward
      the stone with his leash, but Dad keeps missing.

      The water fills to the top. The boys take a deep breath then
      are fully submerged. Ian finally guides Dad to the stone. The
      door above them opens as the stone finally LOCKS into place.

      The boys GASP to the surface. They climb out of the water and
      reel in Dad with the leash.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! We made it!

      Just above them is a circular portal.

                            BARLEY
                  The Phoenix Gem awaits beyond this
                  door! Shall we?

                            IAN
                  We certainly shall!


 
                                                                       110.


      They climb the ladder, laughing as they clumsily help Dad.

                            IAN
                  Dad, we have followed the quest and
                  it has led us to our victory!

      Ian slides the portal aside and sunlight seeps in...


      EXT. NEW MUSHROOMTON DOWNTOWN - DAY

      Ian climbs out of the hole and squints into the sunlight. His
      smile fades as he recognizes landmarks of New Mushroomton.

      They're right back where they started.

      A bus HONKS at the boys and Dad, who are still standing in
      the middle of the street. Barley pulls Ian toward the park.

                            IAN
                       (in shock)
                  We're back home.

                            BARLEY
                  How did we--? No, that doesn't make
                  sense! We took the Path of Peril.
                  We followed the ravens, we went to
                  the end of the water...

      Barley looks more closely at the tile.

                             BARLEY
                  Unless the X meant stay away from
                  the water.

      He turns the tile so the X is on the bottom.

                            BARLEY
                  Or it could be, like, a campfire...
                       (beat)
                  It's okay. We can figure this out.

                            IAN
                  Figure out what? We're back where
                  we started!

                            BARLEY
                  I mean, it has to be here, there
                  was a gauntlet. I mean, unless,
                  that gauntlet was for,
                  coincidentally, some different
                  quest.
                       (beat)
                  That's a possibility.


 
                                                                   111.


                              IAN
                  What?!

                            BARLEY
                  No, no, no, this has to be where
                  the Phoenix Gem is.
                       (beat)
                  I followed my gut.

                            IAN
                       (dawning)
                  Oh no...

                              BARLEY
                  What?

                            IAN
                  The gem is in the mountain. The
                  mountain we could have been to
                  hours ago if we'd just...
                       (catching himself)
                  If we'd just stayed on the
                  expressway.

                            BARLEY
                  No, the expressway is too obvious,
                  remember?! You can never take the--

                            IAN
                  If I hadn't listened to you! Okay?
                  I can't believe this. You act like
                  you know what you're doing, but you
                  don't have a clue... and that's
                  because you are a screw-up! And now
                  you have screwed up my chance to
                  have the one thing I never had!

      Barley looks at Ian, hurt.

      Ian takes Dad by the leash walks into the park.

                            BARLEY
                  Where are you going?

                            IAN
                  To spend what little time we have
                  left with Dad!

      Ian looks at the staff in disgust. He hands it to Barley.

                            BARLEY
                  Ian, wait! We can still find the
                  Phoenix Gem! We just have to keep
                  looking!


 
                                                                      112.


      But Ian just keeps walking with Dad further into the park.

                              BARLEY
                  Ian! IAN!


      EXT. OCEANSIDE CLIFF - PARK - DAY

      Ian reaches a cliff. He looks sadly out at the sun starting
      to set into the ocean. Dad searches around with his foot.

                            IAN
                  No, Dad. He's not here.

      Ian and Dad sit down on the ground, facing the setting sun.


      EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

      Meanwhile, Barley frantically searches the park.

                            BARLEY
                  Come on, where is it?

      Barley looks at the fountain.

                            BARLEY
                  Follow the water!

      Barley races to the fountain and sloshes in the dirty water
      looking for a clue. Two nearby construction workers notice.

                            CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                  Alright, come on, out of the
                  fountain.

                            BARLEY
                  No! I'm looking for an ancient gem!

                            FENNWICK
                  Yeah, we know the old days.

                            BARLEY
                  Stop! Please! No!

      The construction workers pull him away from the fountain.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay! Okay! Ow! Okay, I'm leaving!

      Barley breaks free from them and races back to the fountain.

                              FENNWICK
                  Hey!


 
                                                                      113.


                            CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                  Hey! Oh, come on.

      They try to grab him again, but he awkwardly shimmies to the
      top, arms wrapped around the spire, wet and pathetic.

                            CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                  Can someone call the cops?! We got
                  the history buff again!

      Barley looks desperate and confused. The screwup everyone
      always believed him to be.


      EXT. OCEANSIDE CLIFF - PARK - DAY

      Ian pulls out the list of things to do with Dad. His heart
      breaks as he begins to cross off one item after another.

      Ian is about to cross off DRIVING LESSON when he stops.

                                                   IN FLASHBACK:


      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

                            IAN
                  I can't do this!

                            BARLEY
                  Yes, you can!

                            IAN
                  I'm not ready!

                            BARLEY
                  You'll never be ready! MERGE!!

                              IAN
                  AHHH!!!

      Ian floors it and drives onto the freeway.

                            BARLEY
                  Ha-ha! Nice job!

                                                   END FLASHBACK.

      Ian thinks. Then places a check mark next to DRIVING LESSON.

      He goes back to the top of the list: PLAY CATCH.

                                                   IN FLASHBACK:



 
                                                                     114.


      INT. TUNNEL - DAY

      Barley throws a cheese doodle chunk.

                            BARLEY
                  THINK FAST!

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar!

      Ian catches it with magic.

                                                   END FLASHBACK.

      Ian checks off PLAY CATCH.

      The next item on the list: LAUGH TOGETHER.

                                                   IN FLASHBACK:


      EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

      The boys dance with Dad at the rest area.

                                                   END FLASHBACK.

      Ian checks off LAUGH TOGETHER.

      The next item on the list: SHARE MY LIFE WITH HIM.

                                                   IN FLASHBACK:


      EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

      Young Ian stands nervously at the edge of a diving board.
      Young Barley pushes him in. Ian laughs and they both play.

                                                   CUT TO:


      INT. BEDROOM - DAY

      The boys pillow fight. Young Ian hits Young Barley. Barley
      falls over, pretending Ian hit him with a lot of strength.

                                                   CUT TO:


      EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - DAY

      Young Barley pushes young Ian on a bike then lets him go.



 
                                                                       115.


                              YOUNG BARLEY
                  Woohoo!


      EXT. OCEANSIDE CLIFF - PARK - DAY

      Barley's encouraging words swirl around in Ian's memory.

                            BARLEY
                  I know you're stronger than that!

                                                   CUT TO:

                            BARLEY
                  My little brother has the magic
                  gift!

                                                   CUT TO:

                            BARLEY
                  DON'T HOLD BACK!

                                                   CUT TO:

                            BARLEY
                  Hey, you can do this.

                                                   CUT TO:

      Ian sees he's crossed off everything on the list. He puts the
      checklist back in his pocket, takes Dad's leash, and races
      into the park, toward Barley.


      EXT. FOUNTAIN - DAY

      Barley crouches on top of the fountain, evading the cops who
      call to him from below.

                            OFFICER SPECTER
                  Okay, come on. Get down right now.

      Barley notices a shape on the fountain that matches the tile
      from the entrance to the tunnel. His eyes light up. He slowly
      pushes the tile into the matching shape in the fountain.

      The tile slides in with a CLACK. It's a perfect fit.

      An eye atop the fountain opens to reveal the PHOENIX GEM.

                            BARLEY
                  YEAH! YEAH!




 
                                                                      116.


      He grabs the gem, but doesn't notice a red mist that pours
      from the fountain. Ian clears the woods and sees Barley on
      the fountain, holding the gem triumphantly.

                               IAN
                  BARLEY!

      Barley looks at Ian.

                               BARLEY
                  Ian, look!

      Ian smiles, impressed. But then sees the ominous red smoke.

                            IAN
                  Behind you!

      Barley turns to see the red smoke go past the police
      officers. They slowly back into the crowd.

                            BARLEY
                  It's a curse!

      The smoke pulls apart the high school with its red coils,
      forming the shape of a massive DRAGON. It turns to reveal it
      has the eerie, smiling face of the school's dragon mascot.

      The dragon sees the gem in Barley's hand and ROARS a
      terrifying, garbled version of the school bell.

                            IAN
                  Barley, RUN!

      Barley jumps down from the fountain, grabs the staff, and
      takes off running. He calls out to the dragon.

                            BARLEY
                  What do you want?! The gem?! Fine.
                  Take it!

      He THROWS the gem as far as he can in the other direction.
      The dragon turns to chase the gem.

      But when it lands, we see it isn't the gem at all. It's
      Guinevere's turn signal.

      Barley and Ian race toward each other. Barley holds up his
      hand to reveal he still has the real gem.

      The dragon turns, sees Barley with the gem, and breathes a
      wall of fire between the boys. Ian and Barley are thrown to
      the ground, they can't get to each other.

      The dragon takes a flying leap toward the boys and Dad.


 
                                                                       117.


      Suddenly, a dark shape sweeps down from the sky. The
      Manticore, holding the Curse Crusher sword, BASHES the dragon
      to the ground.

                            BARLEY
                  The Manticore!

      Ian squints and sees someone riding atop the Manticore.

                              IAN
                  Mom?!

      Laurel stands atop the Manticore heroically.

                            LAUREL
                  It's okay, boys! We'll take care of-

      The Manticore tips to one side.

                            LAUREL
                  Whoa, you're tilting, you're
                  tilting!

      The Manticore straightens.

                              IAN
                  Mom!

                            LAUREL
                  Go see your father!

                            BARLEY
                       (to Ian)
                  It's okay! If they stab the beast's
                  core with that sword, the curse
                  will be broken! Come on!

      The Manticore flies toward the dragon, taunting it into a
      chase. As the dragon follows briefly distracted, the
      Manticore loops around and cuts off the dragon's wings.

      The boys climb the hill to get around the fire: Ian up one
      side with Dad, Barley up the other with the staff and gem.

      As they meet at the top, Barley hands Ian the staff.

                             IAN
                  Barley, what I said before-- I am
                  so sorry--

                            BARLEY
                  There's no time! The sun is about
                  to set!



 
                                                                       118.


      Ian holds out the staff with the gem inside.

                            IAN
                  Only once is all we get,
                  Grant me this rebirth,
                  'Til tomorrow's sun has set,
                  One day to walk the earth!

      A beam of light shoots from the staff. Ian holds on strong.

      The Manticore flies back toward the dragon, fast and fierce.

                            MANTICORE
                  Time to crush a curse!

      But the dragon swats the Manticore out of the sky with its
      tail. Laurel and the Manticore CRASH to the ground. Laurel
      gets up, but the Manticore cannot.

                            MANTICORE
                  Ooh, my back!

      A shadow passes over them as the dragon makes its way toward
      the boys. Laurel lifts the heavy Curse Crusher and wields it.

                            LAUREL
                  I am a mighty warrior...

      Laurel clambers up the tail of the dragon with the sword. The
      music from Laurel's warrior workout video plays. Laurel runs
      to the curse's core, glowing deep beneath its armor.

      Laurel holds the sword above her head with both hands and
      STABS the sword into the core.

                            LAUREL
                  I AM A MIGHTY WARRIOR!

      The dragon slows to a stop. The boys watch the red of the
      curse turn blue. Laurel holds the sword with great effort.

                            LAUREL
                  Hurry, I can't hold this for long!

      The sword is up to the hilt in the armor, but just barely
      piercing the red core.

      Meanwhile, the gem lifts out of the staff and spins. Red,
      ominous light grows around it, the staff begins to shake.

                            IAN
                  No, no, no, no, no--

      The red magic swells and is about to explode...


 
                                                                       119.


                              IAN
                  Barley!

      Barley runs and braces his back against Ian's.

      There's an explosion. Then the gem floats over Dad and begins
      raining magic down upon him, slowly building the rest of him.

      The boys watch with joy.

      The dragon's armor begins to shift, slowly working the sword
      out of the core. Now freed, the dragon knocks Laurel off its
      back. The sword falls deep into a pile of lockers.

                            LAUREL
                  Boys! It's coming back!

      The dragon's eyes turn immediately to the gem.

      Ian and Barley turn to the dragon as Dad continues to
      generate. The sun is beginning to set.

                            BARLEY
                  I'll go distract it!

                            IAN
                  What? No! If you do that, you'll
                  miss Dad.

                            BARLEY
                  It's okay. Say hi to Dad for me.

      Ian takes this in and suddenly realizes what he has to do.

                            IAN
                  No. You go and say goodbye.

                              BARLEY
                  What?

                            IAN
                  I had someone who looked out for
                  me, someone who pushed me to be
                  more than I ever thought I could
                  be. I never had a dad... but I
                  always had you.

      Barley opens his mouth to respond, but before he can say
      anything, Ian takes the staff and races off.

      Ian leaps off the ledge, calling out the trust bridge spell.

                            IAN
                  Bridrigar Invisia!


 
                                                                       120.


      He lands on the bridge midair and runs toward the dragon.

                            IAN
                  Boombastia!

      Fireworks shoot from his staff, blinding the dragon.

      The dragon whips its tail toward Ian. It misses the first
      time, but then the dragon lifts its tail to strike Ian again.

                            IAN
                  Aloft Elevar!

      Ian stops the tail by levitation. He strains to hold it.

      Meanwhile, Laurel tries desperately to reach the hilt of the
      Curse Crusher deep in the locker pile.

      The dragon whips its tail, sending Ian and the staff soaring.
      Ian crashes to the ground, watching helplessly as the staff
      splashes into the ocean.

                              IAN
                  NO!

      The dragon marches straight towards Barley and Dad.

                            IAN
                  No. No. No-- No!

      Laurel gets her fingertips on the sword. It's precariously
      perched, slipping toward a deeper fall.

      Ian searches for a way.

                            IAN
                  Use what I have. Uh, what do I
                  have? I have nothing!

      He looks at his empty hands.

                            IAN
                  Splinter...

      Ian sees a splinter from the staff in his hand.

                            IAN
                  Magic in every fiber.

      Ian bites out the splinter and holds it out in his hand.

                            IAN
                  Magnora Gantuan!



 
                                                                       121.


      The splinter grows into a full-size staff.

      Ian sees the beast closing in on Barley and Dad.

                              IAN
                  NO!

      Ian points the staff and yells...

                            IAN
                  Voltar Thundasir!

      A colossal bolt of lighting shoots from his staff and blasts
      most of the armor off the dragon. It keeps advancing, still
      dragon-shaped, but with its core clearly exposed.

      The Curse Crusher begins to fall, but Laurel JUST grabs it by
      the tip of its blade. She stands and calls out to Ian.

                              LAUREL
                  Ian!

      She hurls the sword toward Ian with all her might.

                              IAN
                  Accelior!

      Ian rushes the sword mid-air with the velocity spell and
      plunges it straight into the core of the curse. It billows
      into the air as a red cloud, then dissipates into nothing.

      Ian falls to the ground, spent. The staff clatters away from
      him and is blocked by the rubble that was once the dragon.

      Ian gets up but is stopped by a sharp pain in his ankle.

                              LAUREL
                  Ian!?

      Ian turns to see Laurel through a crack in the debris. Colt
      runs up alongside her.

      Suddenly there's a warm burst of light from atop the peak.
      Laurel and Colt look toward the light, stunned.

      Ian climbs the rubble to find a gap through which he can see.

      Barley is face to face with a glowing figure. The glowing
      subsides to reveal Dad. All of him.

      Barley and Dad look uncomfortable at first; two strangers
      getting to know each other. Ian can only see Dad's back.




 
                                                                     122.


      Ian slips from his position and loses sight of Barley and
      Dad. He turns to see the sun is disappearing.

      He climbs back up and continues to watch.

      Dad and Barley talk and laugh together.

      Dad reaches out and gives his big son a hug.

      The sun sets.

      And Dad vanishes in Barley's arms.

      Barley collects himself, then climbs down the peak.

      Tears fill Laurel's eyes, she leans on Colt.

      Barley reaches down to help up Ian. The boys stand atop the
      rubble face to face.

                            IAN
                  What did he say?

                             BARLEY
                  He said he always thought his
                  wizard name would be Wilden the
                  Whimsical.

                            IAN
                  Wow, that's really terrible.

                            BARLEY
                  I know.
                       (beat)
                  He also said he's very proud of the
                  person you grew up to be.

                            IAN
                  Well, I owe an awful lot of that to
                  you.

                             BARLEY
                  He kinda said that too.
                        (beat)
                  Oh, and he told me to give you
                  this.

      Barley leans down and gives Ian a big, loving hug.

      Ian smiles, and hugs him back.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.




 
                                                                       123.


      EXT. MODERN WORLD - MONTHS LATER

      Over black.

                            IAN (V.O.)
                  Long ago, the world was full of
                  wonder!

      Over the rolling hills, into suburban neighborhoods.

                            IAN (V.O.)
                  It was adventurous, exciting, and
                  best of all, there was magic.

      A familiar building at the top of a hill - the Manticore's
      Tavern with a sign that reads "GRAND RE-OPENING."


      INT. MANTICORE'S TAVERN - DAY

      The tavern looks like it did in it's glory days. A sprite
      flies with a stein toward a group of sprites playing darts. A
      sprite tosses bullseye. The sprites celebrate.

                            BULLSEYE SPRITE
                  Ha-ha! Bullseye!

      The Manticore, her wings outstretched, tells a tale.

                            MANTICORE
                  And then with a slash of my mighty
                  sword, I severed the beast's wings
                  from its wretched body!

      She blows a flame to light the candles on a birthday cake.
      The kids' birthday hats get a little scorched.

                            MANTICORE
                  Okay, who wants cake?

      She proudly lifts the glorious Curse Crusher to the skies,
      then brings it down hard and slices the cake.

      Frosting splatters on the kids faces. There's a beat, then...

                            BIRTHDAY KIDS
                       (joyful)
                  YEAH!!!

      The parents watch uncomfortably. Cake on their faces as well.




 
                                                                      124.


      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      Ian stands in front of a classroom giving a presentation. He
      holds the new staff he made from the splinter.

                            IAN
                  And I think with a little bit of
                  magic in your life... you can do
                  almost anything.

      A student, YELDAEH, raises her hand.

                            YELDAEH
                  Is that how you put the school back
                  together?

                              IAN
                  Uh, yes!

      Another student, THEYUS, interrupts.

                            THEYUS
                  Is that also how you destroyed the
                  school in the first place?

                            IAN
                  Uh... Also yes?

      The bell RINGS. The students leave. Sadalia and her group of
      friends walk up to Ian.

                            SADALIA
                  Hey, that was great.

                              IAN
                  Thanks!

                            GURGE
                  You going to the park later?

                            IAN
                  Yeah! See you there!

      They all wave goodbye to Ian as they leave.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Ian walks in the front door, smiling.

                              IAN
                  Mom!




 
                                                                      125.


      Blazey barrels around the corner and knocks Ian to the
      ground. But Ian stays there and wrestles playfully with her.

      Laurel hustles around the corner with the spray bottle.

                            LAUREL
                  Blazey! Down!

                            IAN
                  Who's a good dragon? Who's a good
                  dragon?

                            LAUREL
                  So, how was school?

                            IAN
                  It was... really good.

                            LAUREL
                  Well, alright.

      Colt sidles up to Laurel.

                            COLT
                  Hey! There he is. You working hard?

                            IAN
                  Nope, hardly workin'.

      Colt throws his head back and laughs. Laurel gets a text.

                            LAUREL
                  Oh, I gotta go. I'm meeting the
                  Manticore for a night out.

      Laurel picks up a battle axe.

                            OFFICER GORE (O.S.)
                       (on radio)
                  We have a 113 in progress. All
                  units report.

      Colt kisses Laurel, then he leaves.

                            COLT
                  Duty calls. Time to hit the trail!

                            LAUREL
                  You forgot your keys!

                            COLT
                  Don't need `em! I was born to run.
                  H'yah!



 
                                                                       126.


      Colt runs full-speed down the road, his hair flowing.


      INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - DAY

      Ian watches from the living room and smiles. Suddenly he's
      attacked from behind. Barley has him in a choke hold. But Ian
      gets out of it and slams Barley to the ground.

      Barley smiles. Ian helps him up and they head out together.

                            IAN
                  So, how's the new van?

                            BARLEY
                  Oh, Guinevere the Second is great.
                  I've almost got enough saved up for
                  a sweet paint job.

                            IAN
                  No... please don't.

                              BARLEY
                  Why not?

                            IAN
                  Because I already took care of it.

      The new van has a Pegasus with a warrior Barley on her back
      and a wizard Ian riding behind him.

                              BARLEY
                  YEAH!


      EXT. ROAD - DAY

      Barley drives the new van down the road. Her license plate
      reads: GWNIVER2.

                            BARLEY
                  Okay, best way to the park is to
                  take a little something called the
                  Road of Ruin.

                            IAN
                  Mmm... Too obvious.

                            BARLEY
                  Wait, what?

                            IAN
                  On a quest, the clear path is never
                  the right one.


 
                                                                   127.


      The van lifts into the air and flies into the horizon.

                              BARLEY
                  YEAH!!


      INT. IAN'S ROOM - DAY

      On photos of Dad and the family in Ian's room. Pan past
      photos of Dad, then of him with Laurel and Barley, happy.
      Finally, we land on a photo of Ian leaning on Barley.

                                                   FADE OUT:
