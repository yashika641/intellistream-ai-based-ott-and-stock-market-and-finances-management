EXT. LA PIEDAD, MICHOACAN, MEXICO - DAY

TITLE CARD: La Piedad, Michoacan, Mexico ---- 1968

A vast CORNFIELD, topped by the most beautiful sky you've
ever seen. A decrepit DONKEY. Chickens and roosters roaming
free. A mangy dog YAWNS. A beautiful MONARCH BUTTERFLY floats
in the air.

                      LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
           T--minus 15 seconds, second stage
           tanks now pressurized... 12, 11,
           10, 9...

A 7 year old boy, JOSE, walks through the furrows looking for
something. He comes to an ear of corn, studies it. He grabs
it with a strong grip, but it seems to resist being picked.
He yanks it hard, hard, HARDER!

The cob SPRINGS FREE, making him fall on the ground.

He lays on his back, eyes WIDE, looking up: The sky, a deep
blue. A few perfect cumulus clouds float softly away.

He picks up the cob from the ground and mouths the sounds of
a take-off.

                     LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
           Ignition sequence starts. 5, 4, 3,
           2, 1... ZERO... All engines
           running! Lift off! We have lift off
           on Space Shuttle Discovery!

The cob-rocket is off the ground!

                        JULIA
           Joseeeee!

Jose leaps up in a second. He runs through the fields,
holding the cob high in mock flight.


EXT. FAMILY SHACK, MEXICO - DAY

A   RICKETY SHACK on the verge of collapse.
                                                             2.


Lively mayhem as Jose comes out of the cornfield and RUNS
towards his mother, JULIA.

The mangy DOG barks incessantly as GENERATIONS OF THE
HERNANDEZ FAMILY say their goodbyes. There are tears and
COUSINS and AUNTS and UNCLES doing Signs of the Cross on the
KIDS, and long hugs happening all over.

SOMEONE takes the cob from his hand. This is SALVADOR (35),
his father.
             JOSE                            JOSE
   (re: the cob)                   (re: the cob)
Un recuerdo.                    A souvenir.

Salvador just stands there unfazed, smiles and then gives the
cob back.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
No te apures, vamos a           Don't worry, we'll come back.

   kids)                        Time to say good-bye,
Desp�danse, chamacos.           chamacos.

Another 7-year-old, his cousin BETO, approaches Jose.

                    BETO
          See you on the other side, primo.

Jose smiles and nods. They exchange an adult-like hug.

Jose eyes Salvador holding on tight to his grandmother, he
notices his eyes are watery: the pain of constant good-byes.
Salvador quickly wipes his tears away and kisses his mother's
cheek.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Estas llorando, papa?          Are you crying, Dad?
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Me entr� tierra al ojo.         Some dirt got into my eye.

Salvador gets into the car. Jose gets caught by Abuelita.

A HONK.
       SALVADOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)        SALVADOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Vamonos!                       Let's go!

Jose, JULIA (30) and his his teen brothers and sister: CHAVA
(13), GIL (11) and LETY (9) get in the car, an old Chevrolet
Impala 64 PACKED TO THE RAFTERS.

Salvador looks around, melancholic. As he closes the door he
notices a Monarch Butterfly landing on his forearm. He takes
a moment.
                                                              3.

The butterfly flies away. He starts the car and smiles, the
kids and Julia do too.

Everyone waves as the car drives off through a cloud of
flying butterflies and we launch into a...

MONTAGE and CREDITS:

---- Jose looks out the window as he leaves this town behind:
the old colonial CHURCH; the town SQUARE; the soccer field
with the BROKEN GOAL FRAME.

---- They barrel fast through the DESERT.

---- The kids now sleep in the back, tightly packed with
pillows, bags, pots and pans. But Jose, wide awake, FLIES THE
CORN COB out the window, at SUPERSONIC SPEED.

---- A "Welcome to California" sign.

---- Another one: "CHINO, CALIFORNIA: Where everything grows!"

---- Salvador and Julia sit in a CLOUD OF MOVING DUST as they
ride in the back of an old creaky TRUCK, packed like cattle
with PICKERS.

---- A NEW SCHOOL. Jose steps into a classroom. An old and
tired TEACHER gives him a bored look.

---- MASSIVE STRAWBERRY FIELDS; A sea of HUNCHED MEXICAN
WORKERS move like an army of ants, unstoppable.

---- The packed Chevy drives past another sign: "SALINAS: Rich
in Land, Rich in Values"

---- A SEA OF GREEN and the family bent at the waist, filling
box after box of LETTUCE. Beto and his family do the same in
the following furrow.

Jose looks at the sky, then at his mother.
                                                               4.


             JOSE                             JOSE

             JOSE                             JOSE
Por que no se ven de d�a?       Why can't you see them during
                                 the day?

Julia stops and looks at him lovingly, she kisses him and
continues with the tough work.

---- HERNANDEZ TEMPORARY HOME: the family sits around a shabby
table, as Julia styles Jose's hair with lemon juice. His
siblings clear the table and get ready for school.

---- YET ANOTHER NEW SCHOOL: Jose steps into a hostile
classroom. New TEACHER, new CLASSMATES.

---- UTTER FLATNESS. The Chevy bolts past this sign: "STOCKTON:
Someplace Special".


EXT. HERNANDEZ HOME - DUSK

The family UNLOADS the car, finally parked in front of a
humble... HOME in a rough BARRIO. Jose and Lety look at the
place with and air of hope.

                     CHAVA
          Don't get too excited. We won't be
          here long.

Lety shrugs and follows her big brother.

---- A child's hand finishes writing a sentence in a school
notebook: A MILLION MILES AWAY.


INT. FILLMORE ELEMENTARY, CLASSROOM - MORNING

Jose steps in, interrupting MISS YOUNG's class. This is his
teacher, a Chinese-American in her 20's.

She looks up, beaming.

                    MISS YOUNG
          Jose! You're back!!
                                                      5.


LATER ----

Jose recites with his CLASS.

                       CLASS
             Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

Miss Young points at Jose.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Now two times seventeen.

                       JOSE
             Treinta y cuatro.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Now in English, please.

He looks around, hesitant.

                       JOSE
             Thirrrr--ty fooor.

The class laughs at his accent.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Oh, you all think that's so funny?
             Jose, how about two times thirty
             four?

                       JOSE
             Seex-ty eight.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Guys, who can tell me what seven
             times sixty is? No. Make it---- seven
             times sixty three.

Silence, of course.

                       MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
             Take it away, Mr. Hernandez.

                       JOSE
             Four hawndred fort-ey one.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Gracias, Jose.
                 (To the class)
             You see, math doesn't care if you
             speak English or Spanish, because
             math is its own language.

Miss Young winks at Jose. He smiles.
                                                             6.


Beto opens the classroom door and comes in, a little dirty.
He seems skinny and worn.

                    MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
          Well, hello, Beto! It's so nice to
          have you back as well.

Jose gives his cousin a big welcoming smile. Beto sits next
to him.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Por que no hab�as venido a     Why didn't you come to school
la escuela?                     these past days?

                     BETO
          Work.

He shrugs. Jose gets it.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, STOCKTON -- NIGHT

An alarm clock shows: SATURDAY, 4:14 AM. Jose's eyes jerk
open and he springs up. He gets dressed in a rush and goes to
the dining room where he finds his whole family ready to
leave for the fields.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Perd�n, es que no son� el       Sorry, alarm didn't go off.

           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Amonos.                         Let's go.


EXT. FIELDS, STOCKTON -- DAY

THOUSANDS OF GRAPES fill a wooden crate.

And Jose's back at it in the fields with the whole family.
This time, he's struggling: he's tired and worn out. He
admires his father's and mother's skills, even his siblings'.
He can't keep up.

He tries harder, but he steps on a bunch of rotten grapes,
slips and inevitably lands in the mud.

He's FURIOUS. He drops his tools and screams. The meltdown
makes his family, his cousin Beto and several WORKERS, stop
to regard him with confusion.
             JOSE                            JOSE
No puedo!                      I can't!

Salvador throws him a stern look.

Jose speaks directly to him, with that adult-like bravado
that some Mexican children possess.
                                                          7.


             JOSE (CONT'D)                   JOSE (CONT'D)
Estoy lleno de lodo!           I'm covered in mud! I stink!
Apesto! Estoy cansado...       I'm exhausted... sunburnt! I
todo requemado por el sol!      can't take it anymore!
Ya no puedo!

We hear childish laughter. It's Beto.
             JOSE (CONT'D)                   JOSE (CONT'D)
T� callate, pinche Beto!       You shut up, Beto!

Salvador is not amused. He approaches Jose, who wonders if he
has just signed his death sentence. He tones it down.
             JOSE (CONT'D)                   JOSE (CONT'D)
Estoy cansado.                  I'm tired.

The others get back to work.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Todos estamos cansados pero     We all are. But we have to
hay que seguirle. S�guele.      push through. Keep working.

Jose exchanges a look with Julia... then he complies.

Salvador kneels by his side.
           SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
A ver, mijo, por que estas     Alright, son, why are you

The faces of the workers, some exhausted, some smiling.
             JOSE                            JOSE

Jose shrugs.
           SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)

                                a better life.

Jose's eyes become teary.
             JOSE                            JOSE
T� c�mo le haces? Dices que    How do you do it? You say

Salvador turns him around, making him face the length of the
furrow.
                                                            8.

---- The FOREMAN pays their day's work. Jose gets his money.
The family puts it in a shared envelope. Julia keeps it.
             SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
Luego, tienes que checar que      Then you have to find out how
tan lejos estas de esa meta.      far you are from the goal.

---- The endless furrow unfolds towards the horizon. Many
bunches of grapes remain unpicked.
             SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
Tienes que pensar c�mo vas a      You have to draw yourself a

concentrado.                      you focused.

---- The picking routine: hands, muscles, grapes fall in a
bucket, repeat; rhythmic mechanics.
             SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
Cuando no le sabes, hay que       If you don't know, you've got

                                  harder.

---- Jose picks grapes, exhausted. He looks at his fingers...
they're hurting. Then he looks at Salvador, who's still
moving, and gets back to work.

---- Three buckets full of grapes, then four, five. Then six,
seven, eight! Jose, proud, regards his work.

But it unavoidably fades to...


INT. FILLMORE ELEMENTARY, CLASSROOM - DAY

Jose, dark circles under his eyes and mid-yawn, elbows Beto
to wake him up. But Beto NODS OFF.

Miss Young writes several adjectives on the chalkboard as the
rest of the class drills their pronunciation.

                    MISS YOUNG
          Ok, so, for homework you'll have to
          write a composition...
                    (MORE)
                                                          9.

                       MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
             "When I grow up..." I want to see
             how you come up with many beautiful
             and powerful ADJECTIVES, OK?


LATER ----

Class is dismissed and Jose approaches his teacher's desk.
His accent wrapping up his sentences.

                       JOSE
             Miss Young? I won't be able to do
             my homework. We're leaving.

She frowns.

                       JOSE (CONT'D)
             It's pepino season. We're going
             back to Salinas.

Miss young makes an inquiring face.

                       JOSE (CONT'D)
             Pepino. Cucumber.

                       MISS YOUNG
             Ah. Huanggua. Cucumber.

Jose smiles, she gets it.

                       JOSE
             Miss... what are stars for?

                       MISS YOUNG
             `What are stars for?' That is one
             tough question, sir. It's the type
             of question that raises many
             others.

She comes near him and puts her hand on his face.

                       MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
             You know what? I think you're going
             to be one of those people who can
             actually come up with an answer for
             that kind of question.

Jose receives the kind words with the anxiety that comes with
big responsibility.
                                                            10.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, STOCKTON -- DAY

The house is half-packed. Julia puts sarapes and kitchen
utensils in cardboard boxes.

Jose is on the dining room table trying to work on his
composition. He eyes his corncob, the one he brought from
Mexico. Then he draws a field of corn. His fingers have
bandaids.

Lety comes running and turns on the TV.

                    LETY
          It's about to happen! They just
          said it on the radio. Pepito, come!

Chava, Gil and Lety get settled on the couch. Chava makes
room for Julia. Salvador approaches too. The TV has a
magnetic aura.

Jose peeks from the table.
             JOSE                           JOSE
Que?                            What?

                    GIL
          The man on the moon, Pepe.
          Hold the antenna!

Jose takes his position as official makeshift-antenna holder.

The broadcast of the first moon walk starts. Jose watches
from his oblique point of view. The voices of the people at
ground control and the astronauts get into his head. The
televised historic events unfolding are sharply reflected on
his eyeballs.

Salvador stops watching the screen to LOOK AT HIS SON. He
notices something DEEP inside of him. Something stirs within
Jose and Salvador witnesses it.

The 1969 musical hit: "Aquarius" by The 5th Dimension starts
playing.


EXT. HERNANDEZ HOME - NIGHT

Jose lays on the front porch, belly up.

ON THE SKY: stars shine in different ways, different colors.
For a moment, everything is fine.

Jose closes one eye and then the other as he makes his
corncob "ship" fly. Aquarius is still playing.
                                                            11.


Julia peeks out of the main door. She sees her son and is
about to say something, but decides to let him be.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, STOCKTON - DAY

The family packs their last belongings. Jose gets his corncob
rocket. Chava and Lety babble and complain. Then there's a
KNOCK.

Julia opens the door. Standing there is... Miss. Young!?


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Julia, Salvador, Gil, Lety and Chava sit across from Miss
Young -- reaching hard for her very best Spanish. Jose sits
between both parties, like an arbiter.

                     MISS YOUNG
          Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez. Yo
          quisera... respectfully...
               (Frustrated)
          I'm a bit worried about your
          children's education.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Dice que van a arruinar la      She says you're ruining your
educaci�n de sus hijos.         children's education.

                     MISS YOUNG
          I really think you should
          reconsider traveling so much.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Dice que estas tonto por        "You're stupid for making us
hacernos viajar tanto.          travel so much."

Salvador frowns.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Dile que tenemos que ir a       Tell her we have to go where
donde este el trabajo. No       there's work. We don't have
tenemos opci�n.                 an option.

Jose looks at his father, fearful.

                     SALVADOR (CONT'D)
              (In his best English)
          We need to work to build a house in
          Michoacan.

                    MISS YOUNG
          Mr. Hernandez, you work the land.
          You work it with your own bare
          hands...
                    (MORE)
                                                            12.

                    MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
          What happens to a tree if you dig
          it up year after year? Will it bear
          good fruit?

Silence. Salvador thinks about this, still frowning.


EXT. SIDEWALK -- MOMENTS LATER

Miss Young watches the Hernandez's packed car, ready to go
again. She walks down the sidewalk, crestfallen, when Jose
comes running after her, carrying a piece of paper.

                    JOSE
          Miss Young?! I did my homework.

He hands her his composition. The title on the cover:
ASTRONAUT, then a drawing ---- the cornfield, a boy, a corn
shaped spaceship and the stars.

She looks at it. Then she kneels and smiles.

                    MISS YOUNG
          You are a force of nature. Nothing
          will stop you. Remember that.

...and walks away, pursing her lips.

Jose stands there, looking tiny and defeated on the sidewalk.


I/E. SALVADOR'S CAR/FIELDS, STOCKTON -- DAY

A dirty, sweating Jose, watches his father from the
overpacked car where he waits with his mother and siblings:

Salvador seems very upset, he's in the line waiting for their
pay, he counts the money, it's short. He moves his arms
around and complains to the foreman who just shakes his head.

Salvador approaches, gets in the car, puts the keys in the
ignition ---- but the car won't start. He tries again. Nothing.
And again. Nothing. Then he HITS THE STEERING WHEEL HARD!

                       JULIA
          Salvador!

Jose sits very still. Worried.

Salvador sees his children through the rear-view mirror.
Their exhausted and muddied faces.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Ya vieron, no?                 Do you see now?
                                                          13.


                     JULIA
          Salvador...
           SALVADOR                          SALVADOR
Pa nosotros no hay chances,       We don't get chances, no
ni atajos... No podemos           shortcuts... We can't rely on
confiar en la suerte o en la      luck or anyone's good will.
buena voluntad de nadie.

They all look down. Julia does too.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          Actually, you're already very
          lucky. You know why?

The kids shake their heads.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          You get to see your future.
              (a beat)
          Look, over there.

He gestures at the muddy field. A terrible image.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          That's your future.

Julia looks at Salvador with sadness. He lowers his head,
wishing his words weren't so full of truth. The vibe feels
heavy.

A very long beat.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          She's right.

Salvador turns to his children.
           SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
La maestra.                     The teacher.

They sit there... His beautiful and dirty children. We slowly
pan to Jose, looking straight at us with those soulful eyes.
           SALVADOR (CONT'D)               SALVADOR (CONT'D)
Que es eso, Pepe?              What's that, Pepe?


                       JOSE
          Un field?

                       SALVADOR
          What else?

                    JOSE
          People working.
                                                           14.


                    SALVADOR
          People working hard. Because they
          need to.

A beat.

He sees a WORKER in the distance, an older man, bent over the
fields, mindlessly picking like a tired machine.

                     SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          I didn't mean what I said. This may
          not be your future, but this will
          always be your past. You understand
          that?
              (beat)
          Show me your hands.

Jose shows him his palms.
           SALVADOR (CONT'D)                SALVADOR (CONT'D)
Nosotros sabemos cosechar        There's dignity in knowing
nuestra comida, a mucha          how to harvest your own food.
honra. Entiendes?               You understand that?

Salvador looks at his own hands... He turns to Julia she nods
lightly.
             JOSE                            JOSE
S�, papa.                       Yes, dad.

The Chevy just sits there... in the profoundly quiet
emptiness of the surrounding fields as a now more relaxed
Salvador hits the ignition and it finally works.

He makes a U-turn... and drives back.

                    SALVADOR (O.S.)
          The teacher is going to be happy.


INT. SALVADOR'S CAR, MOVING -- CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON Jose, happy, as he rolls down the window, feeling
the breeze on his face, breathing this triumph, and smiling
as this moment sears itself into his mind.

---- CLOSE ON THE CHEVY'S FRONT WHEEL, spinning and spinning...


EXT. UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC - DAY

THE SPINNING WHEEL comes to a full stop. But now it's a
SILVER RIM, parking.

Chyron: 1985
                                                         15.


As we pull back: Is that Salvador's old Chevrolet Impala 64!?
It's been turned into a LOWRIDER: BRIGHT GREEN paint job,
CHROME moldings... a few dents here and there and some rust
on the door -- a work in progress but, wow. Jose Alfredo
Jimenez's `El hijo del pueblo' playing LOUD.

That's when the door opens, and 25 YEAR OLD JOSE steps out
wearing a GRADUATION GOWN. He puts on his cap, and walks
towards campus.

--A bunch of caps in the air.

We hear the graduates EXPLODE IN CHEERS and APPLAUSE.


EXT.   UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC - DAY

CLOSE ON JOSE and an older SALVADOR and JULIA, beaming with
pride taking a picture at the University's entrance.

Jose pulls his cap off, and shows the top of it. There's a
sign. It reads: "HI MOM".

Julia walks a few steps, breaks into joyful tears... Salvador
goes to her and holds her. She looks into his eyes.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, JOSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jose sits at his tiny desk, in his childhood room, his old
cob rocket in front of him.

Jose opens a drawer revealing a precious secret: A NASA
APPLICATION FORM. He examines it. The NASA logo. "Astronaut
Selection Program", followed by a million questions.
         JULIA (O.S.)                    JULIA (O.S.)
Quieres cenar?                 Dinner?

                     JOSE
           No, mama. I'm going out!

Julia opens the door. He tosses the application.

                     JULIA
           Who's the girl? Do I know her?

                     JOSE
           La muchacha no existe, se llama
           Beto and since we're cousins I
           guess neither you nor T�a Berta
           would approve.
                                                         16.


EXT. STOCKTON, FIELDS -- LATER

Jose and his cousin BETO (26), skin hardened by the sun, walk
towards Jose's car. Beto's shift has just ended. The sun is
setting.

                    BETO
          Liver what?

                    JOSE
          Lawrence Livermore Labs.

                    BETO
          What the hell is that?

                    JOSE
          It's a... A federal research
          facility. National security...
          they're running the world's most
          sophisticated X-ray laser,
          potentially the single-most
          important breakthrough for ICBM
          defense in decades.

                    BETO
          So... guns.

                    JOSE
          Defense lasers that we're going to
          put up in orbit. We'll save
          millions of lives if the Russians
          were to attack.

Beto just chuckles.

                    BETO
          Wow, That's pretty crazy!

A beat.

                    BETO (CONT'D)
          Remember that homework in school...
          we had to draw or write what we
          wanted to be when we grew up. I
          remember yours. The teacher hanged
          it in class.

Jose smiles with nostalgia.

                    JOSE
          I remember.
                                                         17.


                    BETO
          I said I wanted to be a ranchera
          singer.

Jose laughs.


                    BETO (CONT'D)
          Dreams are heavy, right? Yo... This
          Liverthing... It's not being an
          astronaut but, still, you get to
          throw stuff into space, right?

Jose is bothered. Isn't THIS enough?

                    JOSE
          That... was just stupid.

                    BETO
          Say we get a couple of cheves and
          toast for lasers in space, dude.

The slight tension is relieved. They get into the car, but a
FOREMAN's voice stops them.

                    FOREMAN
          Hey, Beto! You missed a couple of
          rows!

                      BETO
          I didn't.

                    FOREMAN
          Finish it, man.

Beto is instantly irritated.

                    BETO
          I guess I'll go back...
              (a beat)
          I just think it's great that I can
          be so freaking proud, and still
          have no idea what you're talking
          about, cousin. I'm gonna miss you.

                    JOSE
          It's not like I'm moving, I'm
          staying right here.

                    BETO
          That's not the point. You're moving
          farther, don't you get it? You're
          out of here. You moving to a place
          with a job and a title and respect.
                    (MORE)
                                                         18.

                    BETO (CONT'D)
          And we're all gonna watch you from
          here.
              (A solemn beat)
          Ingeniero. Unbelievable.

Jose takes that in. The foreman screams again.

                    JOSE
          Why don't you go back to school,
          man? Ditch the fields.

                    BETO
          Ain't that easy.

                    JOSE
          Ain't easy but it's possible.

                    BETO
          Pepe, my mom is so sick she hasn't
          gotten out of bed since Christmas.
          My Dad, unlike yours, has not been
          around in 17 years. You got a
          scholarship, I didn't... I got two
          brothers, an ex-wife and one
          daughter to feed. There's no time
          to dream. Just time to pick...

A silent beat.

                    JOSE
          C'mon, I'll help you with that
          couple of rows and we'll go for
          those cheves.

They both go into the field.

Jose notices a young Mexican woman in the fields, ADELA (25),
she's carrying a basket filled with lettuce, a sweated
paliacate, they eye each other. He blushes a little bit.

Jose Alfredo Jimenez's `El hijo del pueblo' starts playing.


EXT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

The song exploding massively from his extra powerful
speakers.

Jose sings his lungs out as he parks his lowrider right next
to a Mercedes... CLINT LOGAN's. Who is stepping out in that
very moment and turns to see what the hell is the deal.
                                                           19.


ON JOSE as he notices the impact of his big entrance, feeling
Logan's eyes on him. Sweating as he tries to turn the music
down. His nervous smile until finally...

SILENCE.

Logan eyes a NASA sticker on Jose's lowrider. He chuckles.

                     LOGAN
           Right. We've all been there.

Jose fake smiles again, waits for him to be gone to get out.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Jose walks quietly into a conference/screening room packed
with SCIENTISTS and ENGINEERS --about 25 people-- facing the
director, none other than THE MERCEDES GUY, who lectures them
from the blackboard.

Jose stands quietly by the door. Everyone seems so different
from him, almost everyone is white and/or has a buzz cut.
Their clothes are different. He's a total fish out of water.

                     LOGAN
           Who can tell me what this is?

He draws a large circle on one side of the board.

                     LOGAN (CONT'D)
           Wild guess, anyone?

                       SCIENTIST 1
           A circle?

                     LOGAN
           Of course not, you numb nut. It's
           the Soviet Union.

He draws another circle on the opposite side of the board.

                     LOGAN (CONT'D)
           Anyone wanna guess what this is?

                     SCIENTIST 2
           The United States?

                     LOGAN
           The United States of America. Now,
           who wants to tell me what this is?

He begins drawing a line from circle to circle, slowly.
                                                          20.


                      WEISSBERG
          A rocket?

                    LOGAN
          Be more specific.

                    WEISSBERG
          A hostile rocket?

                    LOGAN
          Be more specific, Weissberg!

WEISSBERG breaks a sweat.

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          Time is ticking, Weissberg, it's a
          matter of seconds now!

                    WEISSBERG
          A hostile rocket... mid-flight?

Everyone CHUCKLES. Logan abandons the line mid flight.

                     LOGAN
          "Mid-flight"? Wrong. This is a
          godddamn missile at a speed of 5
          miles per second. It carries a
          nuclear warhead capable of
          destroying Manhattan. -- Now,
          multiply that by two hundred, aimed
          towards sixty cities - all at the
          same time. Who is there to protect
          these 300 million people from such
          an attack?

Silence. Jose watches, fascinated and scared.

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          It's not a rhetorical question!!

                      JOSE
          We are.

                    LOGAN
          What did you say?

                    JOSE
          Um... I just said ah... That---- we
          are the ones who can...
          hopefully... protect the...
          Sir.

                    LOGAN
          Who the hell are you?
                                                          21.


                    JOSE
          I'm Jose Hernandez. It's my first
          day here.

                    LOGAN
          In what capacity?

                    JOSE
          Lab engineer, sir.

                    LOGAN
          Wanna know what a great
          contribution to the Defense Program
          would be? Be here on time.

The crowd CHUCKLES.

                    JOSE
          I got lost.

                    LOGAN
          Oh, you think that's funny? As far
          as I know nobody else had an
          answer. And yesterday's was the
          third X-ray laser test we've
          failed, spectacularly. If you
          people can't give me a successful
          test, you can kiss the Strategic
          Defense Initiative and your jobs
          good bye...

As he heads out:

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
              (Re: Jose)
          Weissberg! Get this guy an office
          and get him to work now.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS - LATER

Jose walks a step behind Weissberg -- not the nicest guy in
the world -- as they head down a long hallway.

He opens the door to a tiny, dark, windowless room. There is
an old desk that barely fits, a chair and a lamp. That's it.

                    WEISSBERG
          Here you go.

Jose tries the overhead lights. They're not working.

Jose walks in and tries the desk lamp. It's unplugged. He
looks for an outlet. There's none.
                                                            22.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER

Jose at the reception desk. STACEY, the receptionist, types
furiously.

                    JOSE
          Excuse me... Hi, Jose Hernandez. Do
          you know where I could find an
          extension cord?

                    STACEY
              (Still typing...)
          You're the new guy, right? Come,
          let me show you the supply room.

She opens up a drawer and grabs a HUGE SET OF 50 KEYS.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, SUPPLY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Stacey moves like a squirrel and talks FAST. She opens the
door to a storage room packed with cleaning supplies.

                     STACEY
          Here's everything you might need,
          bleach, mops, brooms, rags, Windex
          -- there's another supply closet on
          the 6th floor, right next to the
          ladies room. Take the keys.

                    JOSE
          Hey. I think you're confus----

                       STACEY
          Also... The third floor men's room
          needs toilet paper.
                 (A beat)
          When you get a chance. Welcome!
               JOSE                          WOMAN
I'm not the----                 Stacey! Mrs. Logan's on the
                                line for you!

                    STACEY
          Coming!
              (To Jose)
          Let me know if you need anything
          else!

Jose watches her go, holding the biggest KEY RING imaginable.
He walks into the supply room and whaddayaknow: There's an
EXTENSION CORD right there on the shelf -- HE GRABS IT.
                                                          23.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, VARIOUS - NIGHT

A HALLWAY ---- CLOSE ON a POWER OUTLET WITH AN EXTENSION CORD
PLUGGED INTO IT. We track down the CORD, past several doors,
then around a corner, and into...


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, JOSE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jose's tiny little office. It's way more welcoming than
before -- his desk lamp now working; he types on a Compaq.

Weissberg comes in and drops a stack of papers on his desk.

                    WEISSBERG
          Read these.

On Jose, frustrated. He looks at his dark reflection on the
computer.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jose fishes around the kitchen for snacks while his mother
chops some onions.

                    JULIA
          What's with the long face?

                    JOSE
          Nothing. Every day feels like the
          first day of school.

                    JULIA
          Do you want to take some tacos to
          work tomorrow?

                    JOSE
          No, gracias, mami.

                    JULIA
          Your sister told me she met a nice
          girl for you.

                    JOSE
          Here you go again.

                    JULIA
          We're not gonna be around forever,
          eh! And then what are you gonna do?
          Grow old by yourself like some kind
          of mad scientist?
                                                         24.


                    JOSE
          Please, mami, not tonight. Today
          was... overwhelming.

                    JULIA
          You try spending a day with that
          man en esta casa, y luego me dices
          que es `overwhelming'.

They hear a thump outside.

                    JULIA (CONT'D)
          I can't believe it! He's back there
          again!

Jose grabs two cold MODELOS from the fridge.
            JULIA (CONT'D)                   JULIA (CONT'D)
Y le llevas su cheve de         And you reward him with a
premio.                         beer.

Another THUMP ---- Jose laughs; gives her a big kiss.

                    JOSE
          They're both for me.


EXT. HERNANDEZ HOME, GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jose emerges from the side of the house and into the garden.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Ya metase, le va a dar un       You should go in. You're
aire.                           gonna get sick.

Salvador is on his knees working on his own orchard. Some
fruit trees are starting to grow. He stands and starts
digging with a shovel.

                    SALVADOR
          There's a storm coming. I don't
          want my trees to get ruined. See
          how well they are doing?

Jose joins him and helps pull old roots.

                    JOSE
          You spend all day driving that
          truck, coming and going from the
          fields to the `caner�as', and you
          come home to work some more.

                    SALVADOR
          You can take the farmer out of the
          fields, but not the fields out of
          the farmer.
                    (MORE)
                                                         25.

                     SALVADOR (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Press the earth there for me...

Jose follows his dad's instruction.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          So? How is it going?

Jose answers by cracking his beer open. Then they sit side by
side, taking in the night.

                    JOSE
          I don't know. I just want... Things
          could be easier.

                    SALVADOR
          You know, it's hard work or
          nothing.

                     JOSE
          You could be proud of me. I mean,
          I'm an engineer, not a janitor or
          something.

                    SALVADOR
          What if you were? What's wrong with
          being a janitor?

Jose looks up to the sky.

                    JOSE
          Nothing... It's not rocket science
          though.

Salvador shakes his head.

                    SALVADOR
          You have a long way to go, Pepito.

Jose fashions a bittersweet smile.

                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          You know everything your mother and
          me did for...

                    JOSE
          I know! I know everything! I know
          you lost the house in Michoacan
          because of me. You don't have to
          bring that up every single time I'm
          trying to have a nice, quiet beer
          with you.

Salvador looks at him a bit disappointed.
                                                           26.


                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          It gets heavy, you know.

Beat.

Salvador gets up off the ground and heads to the house.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Pues ponte fuerte.              Well, get stronger.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Jose is seated among the other engineers. Logan gives his
daily angry briefing. Everyone takes notes. Jose seems
behind, off pace.

                    LOGAN
          We're about to detonate a nuclear
          goddamn bomb and hope that X-ray
          laser shoots off rays at the right
          energies, correct amount and... in
          the precise direction that we want.
          If that sounds insane to the press
          it's because it is. So I want this
          test to run flawlessly. Prove the
          skeptics wrong... And keep our
          funding while we're at it.

CLOSE ON JOSE as he listens...

                    LOGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Today I want you to comb through
          every last piece of data we have.
          Look for errors. The
          miscalculations we don't spot
          today... will blow up our chances
          tomorrow. So get... to work.

The crowd gets up and exits room.

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          Weissberg, are you keeping
          Hernandez busy?

Weissberg nods -- annoyed.

Everyone gets up and knows what to do, but Jose seems lost,
clumsy.

He follows Weissberg and a couple of colleagues through one
aisle but his attention is drawn to the melody coming out of
a small radio in one of the desktops. It's The 5th
Dimension's "Aquarious", bringing back memories.
                                                          27.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jose, in his pajamas, at his desk, the NASA application in
front of him again, but this time every single question has
been answered.

Jose sets it on his desk, grabs a pen, and proceeds to fill --
NAME AND LAST NAME: JOSE HERNANDEZ. He folds it and puts in
an envelope.

Lety opens the door.

                    LETY
          Mom wants to know if you want tacos
          for work tomorrow.

                    JOSE
          I don't. Thank you.

                    LETY
          What's that?

                       JOSE
          Nothing.

Lety shrugs. Jose puts the application away, gets in bed. He
has barely closed his eyes when...


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Jose eats the saddest baloney sandwich. Just like everyone
else. His hair and fashion have changed, his style now
emulates the rest.

                    WEISSBERG
          I believe the X-rays are being
          diffused at the interfaces causing
          a lower energy output and an out of
          focus output beam.

                    SCIENTIST 1
          We're aware of these small losses,
          which is why we pump more energy
          into the reaction, what's your
          point?

Jose interrupts.
                                                           28.


                    JOSE
          Yes, they are small losses, but
          when you cascade your parts, these
          losses propagate over many
          interfaces and they become
          significant. What if we look at the
          man-made pad material, study their
          density homogeneity and select pads
          that have the best match at each
          interface thus minimizing
          disruption at the interfaces?

Weissberg shares a look with the scientist.

                    WEISSBERG
          Sorry, I have to make a call.

He leaves, the scientist follows.

Jose takes a last bite wondering what being taken seriously
would feel like.


EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP, MAIN LOT - DAY

Jose stands by his beloved Chevy lowrider as a SALESMAN
inspects it, taking detailed notes -- Beto looks on.

                    BETO
          Don't do this!

                    JOSE
          It's a 30 year old car, Beto.

                    BETO
          But it's El Impala! Think of the
          adventures we've lived together in
          this car. You know, I think you're
          trying to FORGET who you are!

                    JOSE
          This is not who I am, it's a gas
          guzzler with more miles on it than
          The Enterprise.

                    BETO
          I don't know. It feels like a
          betrayal, this hurts.

Just then, Jose sees Adela, the Mexican young woman he saw
that time at the fields. She's walking by, holding a
clipboard as she heads into the main office. Jose and Adela
exchange quick glances. Something happened there! Did she
remember him?
                                                         29.


                    SALESMAN
          It's in pretty good shape all
          things considered. Let me take this
          to my manager and see what she
          says. I think you can walk out of
          here with a really good deal.

                      JOSE
          Inside?

                    SALESMAN
          There's plenty of coffee and
          snacks.

                    BETO
          That's how they get you, yo. You
          give up your soul for a bag of
          pinches Doritos.


INT. CAR DEALERSHIP, MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

We see Beto in the distance, helping himself to snacks like
it's an All You Can Eat Buffet.

Meanwhile, Adela, THE MANAGER! tries to close a deal with
Jose, but our guy is too nervous.

                    ADELA
          I think you're gonna be really
          happy with this vehicle. Great
          mileage, nice sporty ride... I
          think it's a good investment on
          every level.

                    JOSE
          Thank you, yeah, let's do it, sure.

                    ADELA
          Great!! I'll get working on this
          right away!... Sir?

                    JOSE
          What? O.K. Hey, did I see you in
          the fields a while ago?

An awkward beat.

                    ADELA
          Yeah, probably. I sometimes help my
          father.

                      JOSE
          I do too!
                                                  30.


He smiles, she's perfect.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          Wow. I just... bought a car.

                    ADELA
          Congratulations.

                    JOSE
          Sorry. I don't... My name is Jose.

                       ADELA
          I'm Adela.

                    JOSE
          What car did I get, again? I am...
          Confused. Distracted. Sorry.

                    ADELA
              (Amused, smiling)
          So you don't know what kind of car
          you just got?

                    JOSE
          No idea. Could be a delivery truck
          for all I know.

She laughs.

                    ADELA
          Well, it's actually an old UPS
          truck.

And she's funny? He's floored.

                      JOSE
          Look, I know this is awkward, and
          you're in the middle of work and
          all, but... Uh... Would you---- At
          some point, maybe---- It doesn't----
          You know---- Um... Forget it.

                    ADELA
          Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind going
          on a date on a UPS truck. But I
          don't think it's gonna happen.

                       JOSE
          Why not?

                    ADELA
          Well... Because you'd have to meet
          my father first.
                                                          31.


                    JOSE
          I'm really good with dads.

                    ADELA
          Okay, then. At your own risk.
          There's one more requirement,
          though.

                     JOSE
          Shoot.

                    ADELA
          You have to get your friend off my
          snack bar before I call the cops.

Beto's indeed on his third serving now.

Jose laughs -- Adela smiles: It's on.


EXT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, PARKING LOT - DAY

A new, "americanized" Jose drives into the parking lot.
American music blasting from his speakers, looking sharp and
ready for work in his -maybe too in your face- American
style.

He steps out of his car -- BEEP-BEEP. Proud. Happy. A sporty
MAZDA RX-7 parks next to Logan's Mercedes.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, JOSE'S OFFICE - LATER

Jose sits at his desk. Weissberg walks in carrying a large
box filled with documents and a thin ENVELOPE.

                    WEISSBERG
          You got mail.

He drops the envelope on his desk. A NASA logo on it.

                     WEISSBERG (CONT'D)
          It's a waste of time. Even with
          graduate studies, you know that,
          right?
              (beat)
          I want you to Xerox these -- two
          copies of each page, then archive
          them in the basement.

                    JOSE
          That's... thousands of pages.
                                                          32.


                     WEISSBERG
          Yep.

                    JOSE
          I mean, I thought---- I think there
          might be a better way to use my
          time?

                    WEISSBERG
          This is a good way to use your
          time.

And leaves. What a jerk.

Jose looks at the envelope, his heart racing, fearful,
elated, all the feelings all at once. He reaches for it...
opens it... and pulls out a single page:

"Dear Applicant. We regret to inform you..."

Jose stops reading right there. He would look out the window,
disappointed, but there are none. He's CRUSHED. Jose looks at
the box of documents.


INT. HERNANDEZ SHACK , STOCKTON -- NIGHT

Jose comes out of his bedroom. Salvador is watching a noisy
image on TV, Ricardo Montealban as Khan on Startrek.

                    SALVADOR
          Mira, Starrtrek, would you mind
          holding the antenna for me?

                    JOSE
          I'm going out.

Salvador takes a good look at his son, he has changed.

                    SALVADOR
          Look at you. Vas con Beto?

                    JOSE
          Nope. I've got a date.

Salvador grins surprised.

                    SALVADOR
          Ah pues, mira, good luck. I'll tell
          your mom as soon as she gets back
          from Berta's. She's going to be
          happy.
                                                            33.


Salvador turns back to the TV. Jose looks at his reflection
in a mirror in his way out. Then he looks at his dad.

                       JOSE
             Papa.

                       SALVADOR
             Yes?
               JOSE                              JOSE
Te quiero.                         I love you.


EXT. ADELA'S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

Adela opens the door. She speaks fast.

                       ADELA
             I'm so sorry for what's about to
             happen. Please don't run.

                       JOSE
             What?


INT. ADELA'S FAMILY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

TWO OLD MEN stare directly at us -- gravely. They got craggy
Mexican faces, leathered from years and years in the fields.

Jose sweats.

Adela enters with her MOM, all smiles, they bring a couple of
glasses of water. Jose sips his right away.
             MOM                             MOM
De que parte de Michoacan      Where in Michoacan are you
eres pues?                      from?

                       JOSE
             De la piedad.

A long judgmental beat. Then Adela's mother starts mumbling a
song: "El perro negro".

                       MOM
             "Al otro lado del puente de La
             Piedad, Michoacan..."

The uncles stand still.
              MOM (CONT'D)                       MOM (CONT'D)
Y que cultivaban en               What did you grow in
Michoacan?                         Michoacan?
             JOSE                               JOSE
Ma�z. Alfalfa.                     Corn. Alfalfa.
                                                           34.


The Uncles nod. Jose has no idea if this was the right or
wrong answer.

                    MOM
          My husband will be home soon. He
          had a long shift today.

                    JOSE
          No problem, I'm glad I get to meet
          the rest of the family.

                    MOM
          Are you hungry?

We hear the front door. We reveal a burly MAN covered in dirt
after hours spent working the fields. In a way, he is a
version of Salvador.

                    ADELA
          Papi! So good you're here. Este es
          Jose. Jose - mi papa.

They exchange a blunt handshake. Jose is worried again.
             PAPA                            DAD
Mucho gusto. Veo que ya estan   Nice to meet you. I see
muy instalados.                 you've got settled.


                     JOSE
           Yeah, we were just starting to...
             PAPA                              DAD
   (lo interumpe)                   (interrupts)
Me supongo que no han hablado    I guess you haven't talked
de cuales son tus intenciones    about your intentions with my
con mi hija.                     daughter.

Adela wants to die.
            ADELA                              ADELA
Papa...                           Dad...
             PAPA                              DAD
Adela no tiene permiso de         Adela is not allowed to go
salir en citas. Ya le            out on dates. Have you told
contaron eso?                     him?

Jose opens his mouth, but can't   speak.
            ADELA                              ADELA
Papa!                            Dad!
             PAPA                              DAD

                                                         35.


                    ADELA
          Oh, my god!


EXT. ADELA'S FAMILY HOME - LATER

Adela comes out to say goodbye.

                    ADELA
          I'm so sorry. Really. I didn't mean
          to put you through the Spanish
          inquisition.

                    JOSE
          It's fine. It was... fun?

                    ADELA
          They're actually nice deep down.
          You probably just intimidate them.

                    JOSE
          I intimidate them? Together they
          have the body mass of a large bull.

                    ADELA
          I don't mean it like that... It's
          just... You're an engineer and
          stuff.

                     JOSE
           I thought nerds didn't intimidate
           anybody.
         PAPA (O.S.)                      PAPA (O.S.)
Ya metete, Adela!               Get back in here, Adela!
             ADELA                           ADELA
Ya vooooy.                       Coming!

Adela rolls her eyes.

                       ADELA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

                    JOSE
          Don't worry. I'll come back.

The physics of their bodies resists movement. They could
stretch this moment out forever. It's obvious for both of
them, and it's not a problem. Love happening in silence.
                                                            36.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, SUPPLY ROOM - LATER

Page... after page... after page... Jose diligently does the
work, standing by the Xerox machine as it spits out
documents, charts, calculations and reports.

He's bored out of his mind. Suddenly, though, one particular
GRAPH catches his eye. He picks up the copy and studies it.
His wheels are turning... He stops the machine. And looks
more carefully at the paper.

Then he searches in the newly copied pile for the next page.
And the next and the next, collecting them like a puzzle.

AN EPIPHANY of sorts -- he mentally grinds the numbers, the
pictures, the explosions and THEN----


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER

Jose darts through the hallways until he bumps into Logan and
his ENTOURAGE OF GEEKS, marching out of the building.

                     JOSE
           Sir. I think I may have found----

                     LOGAN
           Not now, Hernandez, not now.

They PLOW PAST HIM, and leave. Then, from the speakers:

                     STACEY (O.S.)
           2-2-1 Jose Hernandez, Room 542
           needs cleaning. Just when you get a
           chance.

We PUSH IN ON JOSE, furious: He's had enough.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, JOSE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON THE MASSIVE KEYCHAIN as Jose GRABS it...


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, MAIN LAB - MOMENTS LATER

Jose peeks through the lab glass door. It's empty. Inside the
WORKSTATION OF A SUPERCOMPUTER.

Then he starts trying the keys. One by one. Till he hits the
jackpot: A KEY OPENS THE DOOR.

INSIDE THE LAB----
                                                             37.


And walks in.

                    JOSE
          Let's do this.

And he SWITCHES HER ON. He gleams, his instincts come alive.

Jose spreads his papers across a desk. He enters information.
He checks the results on the screen. He takes notes -- erases
previous ones, comes up with new ones.

On the screen: "SIMULATION COMPLETE" ---- A printer spews out
results.

Jose is now in a GROOVE. And the space around him has grown
MESSIER: PAPER and PRINT-OUTS, CHARTS, DIAGRAMS. And then:

                    LOGAN (O.S.)
          What the hell are you doing?

BUSTED! Logan and his entourage -- including Weissberg --
circle him like a squad.

                    JOSE
          Sorry, sir, I was uh...

                    LOGAN
          How did you get in here?

                    JOSE
          I have... I have keys.

                    LOGAN
          You have keys? How the hell do you
          have keys to the lab?

                    JOSE
          I have keys to every room in the
          building, sir.

A beat.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          The receptionist thinks I'm the
          janitor.

                    LOGAN
          This is very delicate equipment,
          you can't just----
              (Re: the mess)
          What's all this?
                                                         38.


                    WEISSBERG
          He's supposed to be making copies,
          sir.

                    LOGAN
          He's supposed to be making copies?
          And instead you're...

He reads one of his heavily annotated print outs.

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          What the hell are you even doing?

                    JOSE
          I just wanted to put a concern
          through some tests.

                       LOGAN
          A concern?

                    JOSE
          Yes, sir. My concern is the
          instrument you're currently using
          to measure the laser output is
          subject to interactions with the
          explosion itself.

Total skepticism; but he barrels on.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          You can see it here. And here. See,
          the system works by measuring the
          brightness of beryllium detectors
          when they're lit up by lasers. But
          the problem is these reflectors are
          being heated by the explosion. So
          unless they are separately
          calibrated, there's no way to know
          if the signal they're producing
          comes from the laser or the bomb.
              (A beat)
          As shown by the tests I just ran.

The team looks on with distrust. Logan checks some more of
the papers... It all slowly starts to make sense.

                    LOGAN
          You mean to tell me no one's caught
          this before?

                    WEISSBERG
          That is highly unlikely, sir----
                                                            39.


                    LOGAN
          Highly unlikely? I'm not in the
          business of likelihood, Weissberg.
          I'm into certainty. Scientific
          goddamn certainty. I want you all
          to stay here and confirm these
          numbers for me, is that clear?

                        WEISSBERG
          Sir, I ----

But he's speechless.

                    LOGAN
          Is that clear?

                        WEISSBERG
          Yes, sir.

                    LOGAN
          Be here all night if that's what it
          takes.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER

BOOM -- The massive KEYCHAIN LANDS HARSHLY ON STACEY'S DESK.

She looks up, Jose in front of her.

                    JOSE
          Hey. So, I'm not the new guy. I
          mean, I am, but I'm not the new
          janitor. I'm an engineer...
              (as he leaves)
          Not that there's anything wrong
          with being the janitor.

Stacey just sits there, she nods.


INT. ADELA'S HOUSE/ KITCHEN - LATER

Jose and Adela sit at the table, drinking a glass of Coke.
Her mother comes in.

                    MOM
          Are you enjoying your chat?

                    JOSE
          Yes, ma'am, thank you.
                                                   40.


                    MOM
          Well, you better say everything you
          want to say to each other because
          Ezequiel will be home in thirty.

She leaves, Jose toasts with the class of coke.

                    JOSE
          Your mom is so cool.

                    ADELA
          She likes you. I can tell...

                    JOSE
          She likes the nerd.

                    ADELA
          You're a different kind of nerd.

                    JOSE
          Yeah? Well, you strike me as...
          Hmmm... I don't know, you're eager.

                    ADELA
          Eager? As a matter of fact I am.

                    JOSE
          So? What's your big dream? Goal?

                    ADELA
          Goal?

                    JOSE
          My dad says you have to focus on
          something, a goal. Then you have to
          work see how far you are, draw a
          path...

Interrupting, direct.

                    ADELA
          I want to have my own restaurant.

                    JOSE
          Ok, no hesitation there.

                    ADELA
          A real restaurant, comida
          Michoacana, not your next burrito
          joint.

                    JOSE
          I would definitely go.
                                                           41.


                    ADELA
          I know you would.

                    JOSE
          I'd put money on it too.

They smile.

                    ADELA
          What's yours? Your big goal, dream,
          whatever.

                     JOSE
          Well...
              (beat)
          When I was a kid... Nah... It's
          stupid.

He thinks about it. Decides against it.

                    ADELA
          Oh, you can't do that! You
          absolutely cannot do that!

                      JOSE
          Do what?!

                    ADELA
          You were about to say something!
          Tell me, what's your big dream?

                    JOSE
          Marry Salma Hayek.

                      ADELA
          Ha!
              (beat)
          Tell me, I want to get to know you.

He wants to but it feels silly. He hesitates. And then:

                    JOSE
          I think I wanna be an astronaut.

She laughs, hard this time. When she stops...

                    ADELA
          Oh, my god, you're serious.

A beat. And then it lands...

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          Wow. You mean to---- Like----
                                                           42.


                    JOSE
          It's stupid.

                    ADELA
          No! No, I just---- I wasn't expecting
          it to... be that. I don't think
          it's stupid at all. It's the exact
          opposite of stupid. It's amazing. I
          feel really unambitious, now.

She laughs.

                    JOSE
          Hey, a dream is a dream.

                     ADELA
          Well, you know, stop by my joint
          for unos tamales on your way back
          from Mars.

                     JOSE
          Will do.

He sees her hand on the table, close to his. He has the
impulse to touch it... Adela smiles. It's so on. He reaches
for her hand.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          Can I ask you something?

                     ADELA
          Shoot.

We hear the door. It's Dad. They pull back their hands.

                    JOSE
          What does a nerd have to do to be
          alone with you someday?

                    ADELA
              (Big, big smile)
          Well for starters you have to dump
          Salma. Then...


EXT. LARGE PATIO, WEDDING - DAY

CLOSE ON A KISS. It's an outdoor WEDDING.

A CANOPY OF LIGHTS, Juan Gabriel's `Querida', colorful
BANNERS, and a small army of GUESTS.

Jose's family CHEERS and APPLAUDS.
                                                           43.


Adela's family just sits there. Her mom has a big smile on
her face, her dad seems rather grumpy. Further back, Beto
POPS THE TEQUILA.

We travel over a MEXICAN FEAST spread across a long table as
FAMILY MEMBERS help themselves to the food, till we land on
Jose and Adela, posing, happy. Someone snaps a photo of them:

                    JOSE
          We're so proud of this project. We
          didn't only have the chance but the
          responsibility of using our
          technology and knowledge to save
          women's lives.
                                                             44.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME - DAY

Chyron: 1994

THE WEDDING PHOTO, now FRAMED. We PULL BACK as...

Little JULIO (3) grabs the frame and BANGS it on a table.

                    ADELA (O.S.)
          Julio, put it back. Put it back
          now!

MORNING CHAOS in Jose and a VERY PREGNANT Adela's domestic
war zone. Jose CHASES Julio down the hallway, making menacing
noises as the kid LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY ----

                    ADELA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          It's not funny, guys. Jose, I want
          that frame back in one piece!

BABY KARINA (1) cries on her lap. She feeds her.

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          Are you getting home on time? I
          have an appointment to go see an
          old shop for the restaurant.

                      JOSE
          Old shop?

                    ADELA
          It could work.

                    JOSE
          Have you decided on a name?

                    ADELA
          I'm thinking my mother's name.

                    JOSE
          That's nice.

Jose RUNS up the stairs and finally CATCHES Julio, lifting
him up and "flying" him through the air. The kid LOVES this.

                    ADELA
          Don't forget the diapers on your
          way back.

             JOSE                               JULIO
Space Shuttle Julio now               (Laughing)
entering the atmosphere, oh,       No, papa, no, no, no!!
wait, what's that? Some
turbulence?!
                                                           45.


He shakes him up and the kid drops the frame, which BREAKS.
They freeze in place, QUIET. They're in trouble.

                    ADELA (O.S.)
          What did I just hear???


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

TIGHT CLOSE on Jose and Adela's KISS.

He checks the mail on his way out. It's empty.

Then Adela, Baby Karina and Julio wave goodbye to Jose as he
backs out of the driveway and heads off to work. It's still
chaotic, but heartfelt and beautiful.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Jose leads a TEAM OF ENGINEERS, Weissberg among them.

Logan enters the room. He's proud. The engineers disperse and
Logan approaches Jose.

                    JOSE
          After many months of adjustments
          and trials we got approved by the
          FDA.

Everyone cheers and claps.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          I have enjoyed every second of
          running this team.
              (re: Weissberg)
          Thank you for all of your work.

Weissberg nods.

                       WEISSBERG
          Thank you.

                    JOSE
          And of course, let's give a big
          round of applause to our captain,
          Clint Logan.

The two men share a kind look. The assembly breaks off.

                    LOGAN
          Hey, I have something for you...

Jose nods, intrigued.
                                                         46.


                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          The Highly Enriched Uranium
          Program. In a shell: The US is
          buying the Russians's nuclear
          material and bringing it to
          America's power plants. They're
          sending the very best, from all
          national labs...

                    JOSE
          Where is that happening again?

                    LOGAN
          Siberia. Do you have a suitcase and
          a good jacket?

Jose smiles, proud. But he's not sure.

                    LOGAN (CONT'D)
          This project is... You would have a
          piece of history in your hands.

                    JOSE
          I... I'm speechless. I just don't
          know. My wife, my kids...

Logan walks to the entrance and turns.

                    LOGAN
          You know... A job like this would
          look pretty damn good in an
          application for the space program.

Jose sighs.


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME -- DUSK

We see Jose and Adela's modest but beautiful home as Jose
steps out of his car and checks the mail, NOTHING.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, VARIOUS - NIGHT

Jose walks into the house. It's dark.

In the kids' bedroom, he pulls up the children's covers and
kisses Julio's forehead.

We follow him into the bedroom.
                                                         47.


                    JOSE
          Adelita? I'm sorry I'm late. I
          promise I'll take you see that
          shop... Tomorrow.

...but it's empty.

The kitchen: Dark and empty. There's light coming from his
studio.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, JOSE'S STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

Jose walks in and finds...

Adela sitting by his desk, looking down. Then he notices his
desk: His six NASA REJECTION LETTERS, spread before her like
forensic evidence.

She just turns and looks at him.

                    ADELA
          What are these?

But he can't come up with a response.

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          Say something.

                    JOSE
          I was going to tell you.

                    ADELA
          I just want to make sure I'm
          getting this straight: You have
          actually applied six times to the
          Space Program... and you never once
          thought I'd like to know?

                      JOSE
          It's---- I thought I'd give it a
          shot.

                    ADELA
          A shot? These are six shots -- Six
          shots, Jose, over the course of six
          years.

                    JOSE
          It's just a stupid dream.

                    ADELA
          A stupid dream?! You wanna know
          what I think of as a stupid dream?
                    (MORE)
                                                    48.

                     ADELA (CONT'D)
           The dream of trusting your partner
           if you're planning to go to space.

                     JOSE
           I did tell you.

                     ADELA
           You mentioned it once over a date.
           Years ago. AND I thought you were
           joking.

                     JOSE
           Nobody's going anywhere, Adela, I
           got rejected six times.

                     ADELA
           And what if you hadn't?

                     JOSE
           But I did! I was gonna tell you.

                     ADELA
           When? Collect call from the moon!?

                       JOSE
           Adela---- I just want you to be proud
           of me.

Beat.



                      ADELA
           You were late.
               (beat)
           Did you bring the diapers?

                      JOSE
           Let's not----

                     ADELA
           Did you remember to bring the
           diapers I asked you for three times
           today?

                     JOSE
           The FDA thing came out today.

Silence.

                     ADELA
               (sad)
           Congrats. Nice work. I'm actually
           pretty proud of you.
                                                         49.


She collects the letters, stands up, and shoves them in his
hands. She leaves Jose holding his stack of rejection.

He looks at his old corn cob, still there in the shelf, a bit
mummified, like an old memory...


EXT. STOCKTON -- NIGHT

Laying on the hood of the car, Jose and Beto drink beer under
the stars. Jose has a pack of diapers in his lap.

                    BETO
          You know they put the diapers by
          the beer stall because it's
          depressed dads who go buy them in
          the middle of the night... Damn,
          you stupid.

                    JOSE
          She's been so stressed out with the
          restaurant thing.

                    BETO
          Maybe she just wants to be in the
          loop if you're planning to go to
          space?

                    JOSE
          Well, not happening. I've been
          rejected six times.

Jose drinks up, feeling sorry for himself. Beto chuckles. A
long silence. Then...

                    BETO
          Gotta bolt, cousin.

                       JOSE
          What's up?

                    BETO
          What do you think is up? C'mon
          you're the smart one, no? A 5am
          shift, of course.

Beto gets ready to go... but then:

                    BETO (CONT'D)
          Look at me, man. Look at you. You
          know, I never bought that bullshit
          about the American Dream.

A beat.
                                                         50.


                    BETO (CONT'D)
          But I see you. You've had love,
          you've had chances. People have
          believed in you. You got a
          beautiful family who loves you and
          puts up with your crap. What more
          do you want?! You made it. And
          that's not because you ditched El
          Impala...

                    JOSE
          Oh my God, El Impala all over
          again...

                    BETO
          What's the deal with space?

Jose shrugs.

                    JOSE
          I don't know man.
              (a heartfelt beat)
          Maybe I just want to take my hands
          off the ground, you know?

Beto shakes his head. Jose lowers his sight.

                     BETO
          Hey, tell me something, who would
          be better than a migrant, someone
          who knows what is like to dive into
          the unknown... who better than that
          to dare leave this planet?
              (beat)
          Be thankful. Go home.

Beto walks off as Jose sits on the hood of his car, thinking.
But he turns.

                    BETO (CONT'D)
          Promise me something. When you're
          up there. Because you ARE going to
          be up there. Have a nice look down
          on earth.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME - DAWN

Jose walks into the dark kitchen at dawn. Jose puts the
diapers on the kitchen table... And just stands there, idly
staring at it.
                                                         51.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME -- NIGHT

A tense family dinner is over. Jose remains sitting at the
head of the table, alone. Adela just stares at him.

                     JOSE
           I'm so, so sorry, Adelita. I...

A beat. They're both tired. She offers her hand. He takes it,
relieved. Weirdly, though, her tone is all business:

                     ADELA
           How big is this... Space idea?

                     JOSE
           What? No. No, it's just a silly----

                     ADELA
           Jose. How big is it?

It takes him a second to come clean.

                     JOSE
           I think about it every single hour
           of every single day. Always been
           there. Can't make it go away.

A long pause.

                     ADELA
           I refuse to be the oblivious...
           permanently annoyed, whining wife,
           so don't put me there... I need you
           to trust me. I take you seriously.
           And if we're going to do this we're
           going to do this right.

A beat.

                     ADELA (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna ask you a question. And I
           want you to give me an honest
           answer, okay?

He nods.

                     ADELA (CONT'D)
           The people that got into the
           Program the last six years... What
           do they have that you don't?

                     JOSE
           Well, there's a lot of training,
           and it's money...
                                                         52.


                    ADELA
          Forget about that. We have savings.
          What do they have that you don't?


PUSH IN on JOSE as a flame is suddenly IGNNITED----


EXT. AIR ACADEMY, RUNWAY - DAY

Jose steps into a sketchy air academy airstrip.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          The last batch of candidates were
          chosen from two thousand nine
          hundred sixty two applicants.

AN OLD CESSNA threatening to fall apart and a weird looking
FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR welcome him. He hands him some cash.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          Some are military, some hold PhDs.
          There's engineers and scientists,
          there's even some teachers... and
          pilots.


INT. CESSNA, ON THE GROUND- LATER

INSTRUMENTS. AIRSPEED. HORIZON. Jose sits next to the
instructor. He takes the yoke.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          Lots of pilots. Really good ones,
          too.

                    INSTRUCTOR
          So... This is up, this is down...

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          They also have extensive success in
          high performance hobbies.


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, DRIVEWAY - DAWN

SNEAKERS. SHOE LACES -- TIGHT! Jose, in running gear,
stretches on the driveway.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          Running, swimming, triathlons,
          fishing, tennis, weight-lifting...
          I mean some of these guys are
          outright athletes.
                                                            53.


EXT. STREET - LATER

Jose RUNS, determined. About to cross a street, so focused he
misses the CAR THAT ALMOST HITS HIM -- DRIVER HONKS. Sorry!

                     JOSE (V.O.)
           One of them is a professional deep
           sea diver who has logged over 700
           dives. Diving is key.


INT. POOL - DAY

MASK. TANK. REGULATOR. Jose, dips backwards into a pool.

UNDERWATER----

He adjusts the mouthpiece, but it loosens and falls out. He
rises, panicking!


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME -- DAY

Jose takes an envelope from the mail box. He opens it, and
reads the letter: It's from NASA, and it says:

"Dear Applicant -- We regret to inform you..."

He stops reading, pissed.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, PARKING LOT - DAWN

Early morning. Logan parks his Mercedes. He grabs his things,
looks out:

Jose SPRINTS down the parking lot.

                     LOGAN
           Talk about a mid-life crisis.

                     JOSE (V.O.)
           Oh, and of course there's the
           language thing. These guys speak
           Chinese, French, German... But the
           most important one is, of course...

-- Jose stops and looks at Logan.

                     JOSE
           Hey about that Highly Enriched
           Uranium Program...
                                                            54.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, JOSE'S STUDIO - NIGHT

Jose holds a crying 12-MONTH-old BABY GIRL as he enters his
studio, sits by his desk, and tries to OPEN an ENVELOPE with
one hand. He pulls out a LETTER and reads:

"Dear Applicant. We regret to inform you...

                                                    CUT TO:

-- Jose at a meeting with the all the engineers at Livermore.

-- Once again, a very PREGNANT Adela serves dinner with
Jose's help. Their big family growing around them.

-- Jose runs a Marathon. Julio offers a cup of water as he
passes in-front of their yard, Jose grabs it without
stopping.

-- Adela GIVES BIRTH!

-- Another letter: "WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU..."

-- And another: "IT IS WITH UTMOST REGRET..."

-- And another: "UNFORTUNATELY..."

-- "JOSE HERNANDEZ" on a brand new NASA application form.
FOLDED. ENVELOPE. SEALED.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, KITCHEN - DAWN

Early morning breakfast. Kids are loud and they all ask:

                    KIDS
          Where's papa???


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jose RUNS down the street, looks both ways, BOLTS PAST THE
STREET CROSSING, and drops the application in a MAILBOX.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          It's probably taken them all years
          to get to where they are.


EXT. POOL - DAY

FINS. PRESSURE GAUGE UP! A SPLASH UNDERWATER. Jose scuba
dives in the pool.
                                                           55.


                     JOSE (V.O.)
          And still, even if you get good at
          all these things, there's no
          guarantee.


INT. CESSNA, ON THE GROUND - DAY

Jose holds the control yoke once more.

                    INSTRUCTOR
          Turn right to course three one zero
          and descend to 5,000 feet.

Jose complies, he looks at the guy who seems on a trance...
Is he ok?

                    JOSE
          You know we're on the ground,
          right?

                    INSTRUCTOR
          You'll be up when you're ready.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          I could get good. And then get
          better... And then even better...


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, JOSE'S STUDIO - NIGHT

Jose enters his studio, sits by his desk, and OPENS an
ENVELOPE. NASA LETTERHEAD, then:

"Dear Applicant. We regret to inform you...

He stops reading and folds   it back up. Then he opens up a
desk drawer, pulls a stack   of ten other NASA rejections, adds
the new one to the pile...   and closes the drawer. His cob
rocket seems to be staring   back at him with disappointment.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          All upcoming space travel will be
          to the International Space Station.
          Russian is a must.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME -- EVENING

Jose and Adela clear the table post-dinner. Jose takes one
last stack of plates out of her hands... and DANCES WITH HER.

                    ADELA
          Everything okay?
                                                      56.


                    JOSE
          Yeah.
              (A beat - sad)
          All good.

                       ADELA
          Sure?

Adela makes a face, kisses him. LOOKS at him.

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          You need to go to Russia.

He looks at her. Is she for real?

                       JOSE
          I'm sorry.

                    ADELA
          About what? Don't be silly.

                    JOSE
          Por el restaurante.

                    ADELA
          Are you saying that in Spanish to
          make it easier?

                    JOSE
          We're spending the restaurant
          money.

                    ADELA
          We're going to be fine... Please
          let me go, I feel like a drifting
          zeppelin.

Jose stops at her lack of romanticism. She laughs.

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          What? That is exactly how I feel.

She smiles and kisses him.

                    JOSE
          I'm really sorry.

                    ADELA
          Well now you have to do what you
          have to do to get this, right?
                                                          57.


                    JOSE
          I'd be traveling nonstop. I'd miss
          all of you so much... the new
          baby...

He kisses her enormous belly.

                     ADELA
          We grew up watching our people make
          sacrifices. Your parents, my
          parents... Look at us, I mean. It's
          on us now.

She's going to say something more but one of the kids starts
CRYING. Adela gets up. Jose stays there, eyes open...

Salvador, working on a field, touching the earth, looks back
at him from one of the family photos framed on the wall.


INT. AIRPORT - DAY

-- An airplane flying through the sky.

-- A Russian stamp on Jose's American passport.


EXT. MOVING CAR, SIBERIA - DAY

Jose looks out a car window. SIBERIA -- white nothingness.

                     RUSSIAN ENGINEER (V.O.)
              (In Russian)
          As the High Enriched Uranium
          Transparency Program gets underway,
          we welcome American volunteer Jose
          Hernandez.


INT. NUCLEAR CONTROL ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON JOSE as a small crowd of ENGINEERS applauds. Reveal
a CONTROL ROOM with wall to wall screens and NUCLEAR GAUGES.

                    RUSSIAN ENGINEER
          He'll be with us for the next
          months, let's make him feel right
          at home.

People laugh.

                    JOSE
              (Struggles in Russian)
          I... thank... you... very... much.
                                                          58.


ON JOSE'S look, lost, jet-lagged and confused.


EXT. SIBERIA - DAY

Dead silence. A vast, snow-covered Siberian field. Jose RUNS
THROUGH it.

                    ADELA (ON THE PHONE)
          I really like `Yesenia'. My mother
          insists on `Dolores'.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          I'm so sorry. I should have been
          there. I feel... I...

                    ADELA (ON THE PHONE)
          I know. This sucks... But we agreed
          on this. Remember.

We just see Jose traversing the white, endless frame like a
tiny little ant.


INT. NUCLEAR CONTROL ROOM, BACK ROOM - DAY

A telephone booth in a back room, depressing, greenish -- Jose
on the phone.

                    JOSE
          I know, but it feels...

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          It was quick. I started having
          contractions and called mom, I
          nearly didn't make it to the
          hospital.

                    JOSE
          I feel horrible for not being
          there.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          Children are born when they are
          born. That's how it is.

Jose sighs.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          Hold on, Julio wants to talk to
          you.

                     JULIO (V.O.)
          Papa?
                                                         59.


Jose looks overwhelmed by the sound of his voice. He takes a
second to compose himself...

                    JOSE
          Julito... Que pasa, buddy? How's
          your new baby sister?

                    JULIO (V.O.)
          She's OK. But Karina wouldn't eat
          her dinner, papa.

We can hear a sweet family quarrel in the background. Jose
listens to it like it's a gorgeous chant.

                    JOSE
          Tell her she has to.

                    JULIO
          I'm going to put the baby on.

Jose holds a tear back.

                    JOSE
          Put her on.

Baby gagging on the other side of the line. Jose is crushed.

-- AN AMERICAN STAMP ON A PASSPORT.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, KITCHEN - DAY

Jose holds the baby - he shows her a set of MATRYOSHKA DOLLS,
while Julia corrals the rest of the kids around the kitchen.

Adela is sitting on the table.

Salvador admires the small creature, his youngest
granddaughter.

                    SALVADOR
          Did you know Monarch butterflies
          weigh 1 gram?

                    JOSE
          I did not, papa.

Of course he does, this is a recurrent tale.

                    SALVADOR
          They fly 2,000 miles every year and
          they weigh 1 gram.

On Jose, a bit lost, noticing a wet diaper.
                                                         60.


                    SALVADOR (CONT'D)
          They travel together, that's how
          they do it. That's how they can
          face danger, the cold, a los
          depredadores, that's how they
          survive and succeed.

Jose smiles looks at his father, he gets it. They share a
moment. Then turns to Adela and his mother. It's been true
all the time; he has it all. He sighs.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adela is breastfeeding the new baby. Jose by her side fills
in a new application, licks the envelope. He looks at her
with tenderness, sadness even.

                    ADELA
          I think you shouldn't mail this one
          in.

                    JOSE
          What do you mean?

-- The NATIONAL MALL. WASHINGTON DC.


INT. NASA HEADQUARTERS, HALLWAY - LATER

BUREUCRACY. Fluorescents. Jose rolls a rickety carry-on bag
down a hallway.


INT. NASA HEADQUARTERS, PROGRAM SELECTION LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

CJ STURCKOW - head of the program, stern, busy, no-nonsense -
talks to the RECEPTIONIST. There's a small army of STAFF
behind him.

Jose walks into the lobby. No one looks up. He comes close
and stands in front of Sturckow. Then he unzips one of the
compartments on his suitcase, and pulls out his application.

                     JOSE
          Excuse me, Sir, CJ Sturckow, head
          of the Astronaut Candidates
          Selection Program. I'm Jose
          Hernandez.

That does the trick. Sturckow looks up, surprised.

                    STURCKOW
          Jose Hernandez from...
                                                 61.


                      JOSE
          Yes, sir.

                    STURCKOW
          What are you doing here?

                    JOSE
          I decided to personally bring in my
          application this year.

                    STURCKOW
          Where did you fly from?

                    JOSE
          Stockton, California, sir.

                    STURCKOW
          You could have just mailed it.

                    JOSE
          I know. But I wanted to meet you
          and hand it to you personally.

A beat.

                     STURCKOW
          Why do you keep trying after all
          this time?

                    JOSE
          Sir, I'm determined to get into
          your program. And I believe this is
          my strongest application yet.

                    STURCKOW
          Listen, Hernandez, this would be
          your eleventh attempt. I admire
          your persistence and I thank you
          for coming all the way out here. I
          wish you'd saved the airfare----

                      JOSE
          SIR.

The STAFF looks on -- intrigued.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          This is my strongest application
          yet. And it's my twelfth attempt,
          not my eleventh.

It's a bit of a stand off.
                                                          62.


                    STURCKOW
          Let's hear it, then. What's
          changed?

Sturckow leans back and crosses his arms. This has changed:

                     JOSE
          Sir, over the course of the last 10
          years every single academic,
          professional and personal decision
          I've made, I've made with the Space
          Program in mind. I got a Masters in
          Electrical Engineering from Pacific
          University. I am now a pilot with
          over 100 hours under my belt. I got
          my scuba diving certificate. I am
          in the best shape of my life, I ran
          the San Francisco marathon not that
          long ago and I speak Russian. In
          fact, I volunteered to travel to
          Siberia as part of the Transparency
          Program of the US Department of
          Energy. I am the father of five
          perfect little children and the
          husband of the most incredible
          wife, who threatened to leave me if
          I didn't come see you.
              (Beat)
          I have applied twelve times and I
          have been on the verge of giving up
          after each rejection. But here I
          am. So you can turn me down again.
          But rest assured I will be standing
          here again in a year.

The staff want to applaud -- they can't.

He sets the application on the receptionist's desk, zips up
his suitcase, and moves toward the door.

Jose nods, and walks out.


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, BACKYARD - DAY

An ASTRONAUT SHAPED PI�ATA gets RIPPED APART by VICIOUS HITS.
It's a kid's party, and Julio -- turning 8 -- is giving it his
all.

The family has gathered around the pi�ata. Loud CHEERING from
Jose, Adela, Salvador, Julia, Lety, Chava, Beto, FAMILY
FRIENDS and KIDS. The astronaut's head POPS RIGHT OFF, CANDY
RAINS ON THE KIDS.
                                                          63.


LATER ----

A BUNCH of Kids play soccer with Beto -- the goalie. Julio
SCORES! Kids CHEER. Beto gets unreasonably upset!

                       BETO
             No mames! I got my eye on you,
             Julito! You keep playing off side,
             that's not cool, man, NOT COOL!

                       ADELA (O.S.)
             Oye! Beto! No digas groser�as!
             Your daughter is here!

Adela comes near MARISA (15), Beto's Daughter, and kisses her
on the cheek.

                       ADELA (CONT'D)
             Jose! Mail!

Salvador and Julia bicker as Jose makes eye contact with
Adela, who was inside the house and now stands by the back
door. She looks directly at Jose, a NASA envelope in her
hand.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, JOSE'S STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

Quiet. Jose sits by his desk. The letter displayed in front
of him -- Adela stands by the door. Expectant. Jose looks
straight at her... Then he looks down at the floor, trying
to... understand?

She comes closer. Then, after a long beat, barely audible, he
whispers...

                         JOSE
             I got in.

Adela doesn't understand. Still very quietly:

                         ADELA
             What?

Adela comes closer.

-- On the letter: "Dear Mr. Hernandez".

A beat.

                         JOSE
             I got in.

CLOSE ON ADELA as the news sinks in. Silence. She smiles.
                                                          64.


                    ADELA
          That's... That's not bad, right?

Jose bursts in laughter. She joins in.

And then they stay silent, looking into each other's eyes.


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, BACKYARD - DAY

Jose hugs his father. Then his mother.

Beto stands by a smiling Marisa at the goal. Watching
everything from afar.

Jose notices him, he grins. Beto does too.

Everyone is in tears, unbelieving.


INT. LAWRENCE LIVEREMORE LABS, RECEPTION - DAY

Jose carries a box with his belongings, nostalgic, walks into
the reception area to find the entire Lab has gathered to bid
him adieu. He stops, confused. Then ENGINEERS, Logan, Stacey
and STAFF, even Weissberg, break into APPLAUSE.

And it doesn't stop. Jose stands there... overwhelmed.


EXT. SALVADOR AND JULIA'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - DAY

Typical Hernandez family MAYHEM as Julia says goodbye to the
kids. She helps Adela corral them into the car -- which is now
a MINIVAN! -- PACKED TO THE RAFTERS.

Jose and Beto, argue.

                    BETO
          I can't accept it.

                    JOSE
          C'mon, take her for a spin. Y dame
          un abrazo, cabr�n.

They hug like its a final goodbye. It's a bit sour but
heartfelt. Then Jose walks away, down the poor barrio street.

                    BETO
          Hey cousin! Que Dios te acompa�e.

Jose smiles... and keeps walking. Beto just stands there.
Then he looks at a SET OF KEYS in his hand, we PAN, and
REVEAL JOSE'S MAZDA, shinier than ever, now Beto's.
                                                          65.


Jose starts the minivan.

HONKING, YELLING, ANARCHY coming from the car.

Salvador and Julia wave them goodbye as the van drives off.

-- A sign: "ENTERING HOUSTON".


EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

The CAMPUS OF JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. Hundreds of buildings
over sixteen hundred acres. Clear Lake beyond. And a SIGN:
"National Aeronautics & Space Administration" -- NASA logo by
its side.

                     STURCKOW (V.O.)
          You should know the program will be
          especially taxing on your family.
          The sacrifices you're about to put
          them through are beyond anything
          you -- or they -- can imagine.


INT. MINIVAN, MOVING - DAY

Jose drives and looks out the window, in total AWE.

LAUNCHPADS, HANGARS, RUNWAYS... This place is amazing and it
feels exciting and alive and POWERFUL.

                    STURCKOW (V.O.)
          It's important you understand this
          does NOT in any way guarantee
          you'll be selected for a Space
          Mission. It's still a long shot and
          most candidates don't even make it
          through the full training.


EXT. HOUSTON HOME, DRIVEWAY - DAY

Adela supervises the MOVERS lugging their furniture into
their new house, a two-story brick home with hedges and
trees. A peaceful neighborhood. The kids run around and play.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, KITCHEN - DAY

Adela opens the boxes marked "kitchen". Opens the faucet. No
water comes out.
                                                          66.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

Jose puts on the blue uniform. He looks at himself on the
mirror, he smiles in disbelief.

                    STURCKOW (V.O.)
          But at the same time, you can't
          lose sight of the fact that you
          have been chosen among tens of
          thousands who share your dream.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Twelve ASTRONAUT CANDIDATES (ASCANS), including Jose, gather
in this room. In front of the class is CJ STURCKOW himself.

                    STURCKOW
          If we want you here it is because
          you are one of the very few, highly
          skilled, extraordinary people on
          the planet that we deem capable of
          flying to space in a rocket.
          Today begins a journey that will
          change you forever in ways you
          didn't even think possible.
          It won't be easy. You will push
          yourselves past your own limits.
          You will work as a team, and you
          will struggle alone. And these are
          your new brothers and sisters.
          Kalpana?

KALPANA CHAWLA, Indian American astronaut and instructor,
takes over.

                    KALPANA
          Hi guys. My name is Kalpana Chawla.
          I've been around here for a while
          and I'll be in charge of your
          mockup training. I say let's quit
          talking and get started!


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, MOTION BASE SIMULATOR - DAY

Jose is strapped into a simulator that PITCHES, ROLLS, YAWS
and VIBRATES like a shuttle orbiter. He looks dizzy.

                    KALPANA (V.O.)
          Keep'er steady, Hernandez.
                                                            67.


Jose moves the control stick with precision but it's no use.
The ship seems to be out of control. AN ALARM SOUNDS -- Jose
SHAKES and ROCKS.

                     JOSE
           It's not responding.

                     KALPANA (V.O.)
           You're not responding -- you control
           her, she doesn't control you.

The SIM jerks and pitches further, jostling Jose in his seat,
now PULLING WITH BOTH HANDS! ANOTHER ALARM GOES OFF.

                     KALPANA (V.O.)
           Level Three, Hernandez -- Go level
           three!!

ON THE SCREEN: The shuttle CRASHES. "FAIL" blinks. It stops
moving. Jose just sits there, drenched in sweat.


OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ----

From the outside the thing looks like, well, a high tech
space machine. The candidates all stand around it, with
Kalpana -- wearing a headset. Sturckow observes.

The hatch opens and Jose steps out, embarrassed.

                     KALPANA
           It's important to remember the
           shuttle is designed to a `fail-
           ops/fail-safe' philosophy so----

Noticing a queasy Jose rejoining the group.

                     KALPANA (CONT'D)
           Hernandez, you okay?

                      JOSE
           Yep.

                     KALPANA
           The loss of one component can be
           tolerated without compromising the
           whole mission.

Jose BARFS. The group takes a step back.

                     KALPANA (CONT'D)
           Yep, that happens. Who's next?

No one. They look terrified.
                                                             68.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, BREAK ROOM - LATER

Jose sees THE ASCANS drink coffee and joke around -- teasing
about training, Sturckow and their upcoming quantum physics
test.

Jose, tormented in a corner, makes a phone call.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          Some kids were mean to him.

                    JOSE
          I'll talk to him once I get home.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          I'm just letting you know...

                    JOSE
          I'm sorry I'll be late again.
              (A beat)
          Did the plumber go?

                    ADELA
          What do you think?

Jose sighs.


INT. NASA - DAY

---- RUNNING FEET. Jose is STRAPPED with CHAINS to a TREADMILL,
barely moving. He TRIPS and FALLS.

---- Jose STRUGGLES to swim laps in full ASTRONAUT GEAR.
STURCKOW stands poolside:

                    STURCKOW
          Is that moon rocks in your pockets?

---- Jose STUDIES at home amid morning chaos. Adela makes
breakfast; seven BINDERS spread out on the table. Next to
Jose, Julio builds something with LEGOS.

---- ASCANS take a test. ON JOSE's desk: GRAPHS and SCHEMATICS
and an IMPOSSIBLE EQUATION. Jose, SWEATING, hesitates between
answers A, B and C. And D. And F.

---- Jose SHAKES and ROCKS in the MOTION BASE SIM; ALARMS
BLARING, on his monitor: FAIL.

THE ROAR OF A JET ENGINE!
                                                          69.


EXT. DESERT SKY - DAY

A wide and deep blue sky gets SPLIT IN HALF by a T-38
SUPERSONIC PLANE. Closer to the plane, we see it make a SHARP
RIGHT TURN and DESCEND like a rock. Now the plane flies LOW
NEAR THE DESERT FLOOR like a torpedo. Then it PITCHES and
SHOOTS BACK UP INTO THE SKY.


INT. T-38 JET, FLYING - MOMENTS LATER

Jose in the co-pilot seat -- queasy. Sturckow is up front.

                     STURCKOW
          What are we gonna do about you,
          Hernandez?

                    JOSE
          What do you mean, sir.

                    STURCKOW
          You know exactly what I mean. We
          need to step up your game!

He PULLS the SIDE STICK HARD -- The plane goes UPSIDE DOWN.

                    STURCKOW (CONT'D)
          Do you know where we are?

Jose looks on his screen -- NUMBERS and more NUMBERS.

                    JOSE
          Ah... currently 35 miles north of
          Houston... ah, 23,000 feet on
          course two one zero, except... up
          is down. And down is up.

                    STURCKOW
          Good! Now show me what you got.

                    JOSE
          What do you mean, sir?

                    STURCKOW
          Tell me how to land this thing!

                      JOSE
          Ah, okay.

Looking carefully into his navigational instruments.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          Houston clearance, this is NASA-
          959, ready to copy IFR Richmond.
                                                            70.


                    GROUND CONTROL (V.O.)
          NASA 959, cleared to Richmond via
          radar vectors to Houston, fly
          runway heading, descend and
          maintain six thousand feet; expect
          one five thousand, approach 120.9.

He didn't get ANY of that.

                    JOSE
          Houston clearance, I didn't
          quite... copy, could you please
          come again?

                    STURCKOW
          C'mon, Hernandez!!

                    GROUND CONTROL (V.O.)
          NASA-959, thought you said ready to
          copy? Descend and maintain six
          thousand feet, expect one five
          thousand - approach one, two, zero
          point nine. I can always email that
          to you.

Sturckow laughs. Jose writes all of this frantically. He
grabs the side stick again and presses the radio button.

                     JOSE
          Cleared Richmond via vectors to
          Houston, fly runway heading, down
          six thousand feet, approach 120.9.
          Thank you.

We continue to hear Jose's MICROPHONE -- his BREATHING.

                    STURCKOW
          Release your mic, Hernandez. Your
          mic is hot.

Jose looks at his side stick. The button is STUCK.

                    STURCKOW (CONT'D)
          Hernandez, turn off the mic!

                    JOSE
          It's stuck.

                    STURCKOW
          What do you mean it's stuck, let it
          go, you're tying up the tower!
                                                          71.


                     GROUND CONTROL (V.O.)
           NASA-959 clear the line
           immediately.


               JOSE                 GROUND CONTROL (V.O.)
I can't---- the button is       NASA-959 you got traffic on
stuck!                          your right, you're holding up
                                the frequency, we need to
                                clear them NOW.

Jose tries frantically to dislodge the button!

                     STURCKOW
           Turn it off, Hernandez, what the
           hell is wrong with you!?

                     JOSE
           I'm trying!

Suddenly Jose SEES another T-38 approaching beneath them:

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           On your right, ON YOUR RIGHT, 3
           O'CLOCK, TRAFFIC NOW!!!

Sturckow PULLS UP and avoids a collision -- the other NASA T-
38 FLIES PAST THEM LIKE A MISSILE!

Jose breathes... Examines the radio button: Realizes he's
activated a LOCK POSITION by mistake. He disengages it.

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           Houston, this is NASA-959, the line
           is clear. Sorry about that.


EXT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, DRIVEWAY - DAY

A very silent street. Adela drags two large garbage bags
across the driveway. As she dumps them in the bins, one of
them BREAKS. She just stares at the mess, furious. She can
hear the kids break into a fight inside the house.

She just sits on the curb.


EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, TARMAC - LATER

The plane has landed. Sturckow strides ahead of Jose. Kalpana
meets them mid-tarmac with her TEAM.
                                                           72.


                    JOSE
          I'm sorry, sir, it won't happen
          again.

                     STURCKOW
          You're goddamn right it won't. This
          isn't flight school anymore,
          Hernandez. You're lightyears behind
          the pack -- get with it or step
          aside.

He walks away, angry. Jose and Kalpana exchange a look.


EXT. HOUSTON HOME, DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A depleted Jose parks on the driveway.

He notices the pile of TRASH just sitting on the sidewalk.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, KIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jose enters the kids' bedroom. They sleep like angels. Except
for one, who whispers:

                    JULIO
          Papa?

                    JOSE
          Hey, son. Go back to sleep.

                    JULIO
          Can I show you my Earth?

                    JOSE
          Sure, let's see it.

Julio sneaks out of bed, and plugs a cord into an outlet.
Then flips on a switch... and his Earth Layer project LIGHTS
UP... It's a large box painted black, featuring glowing
stars, a big round GLOWING EARTH cut in half, all its layers
in different warm colors.

Jose sits on the floor next to his son, admiring it.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          You made this yourself?

                    JULIO
          Yeah. I used a 13 watt lightbulb
          and wired it from behind. Mama
          helped. She's a good electrician.
                                                            73.


                     JOSE
           I think... I think it's beautiful.

                     JULIO
           See, we are right here.

                     JOSE
           Yes, we are, son. We sure are.
               (A warm beat)
           Now go back to sleep.

Julio jumps back into bed, Jose pulls up his covers.

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           Hey son. I'm sorry that I missed
           the whole thing.

                     JULIO
           That's okay.

Jose kisses him.

                     JULIO (CONT'D)
           Hey, papa, why do you want to go to
           space so bad?

Jose stays there without an answer. until finally...

                     JOSE
           I don't know, buddy.

Then he goes back to the Earth, takes one last look, moved:
maybe it is not so bad to stay grounded... and he turns it
off.


INT. JOSE AND ADELA'S HOME, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jose gets in bed, and kisses Adela -- who pretends to be
asleep. We can see her eyes wide open, though.

                     JOSE
           Everything ok?

Nothing.

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           Look. I know this is hard for
           everyone. But I'm the one busting
           my ass, my body hurts, I can't
           sleep. And I know I can make it
           work, I just have to be my best.
           I'm lightyears behind the...
                                                         74.


                       ADELA
             I, I, I, I. Yo, yo, yo. Everything
             is always about...

She stops.

                         JOSE
             About me?

                       ADELA
             I thought we were a team.

                       JOSE
             We are a team.

She shrugs.

THE PHONE RINGS.

Jose reaches for it.

                         JOSE (CONT'D)
             Hello?

ON JOSE --  something terrible has just happened.

                         JOSE (CONT'D)
             What?


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, STOCKTON - DAY

A picture of Beto on a mantel piece surrounded by candles.

FAMILY and FRIENDS have gathered for this wake. The low
murmur of people paying respects, making sense of things.

Jose and Adela sit quietly in a corner between Salvador and
Julia. Jose is depleted and worried.

                       JULIA
             He was coming home from a late
             shift. There was a shootout...

                       SALVADOR
             Wrong place, wrong time.

                       JULIA
             He was such a good boy.

                       JOSE
             It's about time you leave.
                                                         75.


                    SALVADOR
          And go where?

                    JOSE
          Somewhere safer.

                    SALVADOR
          It was an accident.

Jose's heart aches.

                    JOSE
          Too many accidents around here.

                    JULIA
          This is our home. There are good
          people here too.

Jose looks around, the faces of his people, his mother is
right.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jose ambles slowly down a hallway, in a haze.

He walks into his old room. It's quiet.

He eyes a photo pinned on a board above his desk, it's of
young Jose and Beto. The two of them laughing.

Jose sits on the bed...

Marisa, Beto's daughter stands by the door.

Jose wipes a tear, straightens himself up. Neither knows what
to say.

                    JOSE
          I should get back out there. If
          there's anything you need. Anything
          at all. Just---- yeah. I'm so sorry.

                    MARISA
          When are you going to space?

                    JOSE
          Uhm... I'm not sure.

                     MARISA
          He always told me, he was sure you
          were going.
              (beat)
                     (MORE)
                                                         76.

                     MARISA (CONT'D)
           He knew you felt bad for him,
           because he didn't get what you got.

                     JOSE
           That's not true...

                     MARISA
           It's ok. Don't feel bad. But now
           you have to honor him.

Jose's eyes fill with tears.
             JOSE                            JOSE
Yo quer�a mucho a tu papa.      I loved your dad very much.

She smiles.

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           Very, very much.


PRELAP: A SOFT RANCHERA, Jose Alfredo Jimenez's `Deja que
salga la luna' sang by the Marisa's beautiful voice.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME, STOCKTON - LATER

Marisa sings and plays the guitar. It is a beautiful, deep,
sad melody. The song's high notes transform into a collective
cry that hurts and heals at the same time.

CLOSE ON JOSE, deeply moved as he sees each of the humble
faces in front of him, grieving with dignity and resilience.

Adela takes his hand.


INT. PENSACOLA NAVAL AIR BASE - HELO DUNKER - DAY

A massive HYDRAULIC ARM lowers a HELICOPTER CARCASS into a
huge pool. The previous song continues until it fades.

INSIDE THE CARCASS, LATER----

Three ASCANS and Jose get strapped in.

Safety DIVERS await in the water as the hydraulic arm begins
to lower the helo. Sturckow and Kalpana watch.

We stay CLOSE TO JOSE as they enter the pool and the carcass
begins to FLOOD. He sees water pouring in from every window,
every door, every crease...
                                                              77.


He holds on TIGHT to his chair, fighting every instinct to
escape NOW. The carcass continues its descent. The water
reaches Jose's chest...

The water reaches Jose's neck... and creeps further up,
touching his chin -- he tilts his head, and soon it's just
INCHES FROM HIS MOUTH... then he takes the BIGGEST BREATH OF
HIS LIFE... and holds it.

Sturckow, emergency divers, and Kalpana: ON HIGH ALERT.

BACK TO JOSE as the water covers his nose, his eyes...

The helo keeps sinking, very slowly... Still about 5 feet
from the bottom.

ON JOSE---- PETRIFIED. His hand GRIPS the strap buckle like a
cowboy in a duel, ready to shoot.

POOLSIDE---- Sturckow gives the hydraulic arm OPERATOR a slight
NOD -- the arm lets go.

UNDERWATER---- The helo sinks all the way to the bottom...

The candidates unbuckle and release themselves, including
Jose, who swims as fast as he can towards one of the doors.
But just then, he notices one of his mates, struggling to get
out of his seatbelt!

Jose lingers by the door -- running out of oxygen.

The ASCAN struggles and struggles -- he's STUCK!

POOLSIDE---- Cassidy and Kimbraugh EMERGE -- staff fish them
out.

UNDERWATER---- Jose swims back inside the carcass to help him,
who's now panicking. Together, they struggle to undo the
buckle, but it's completely stuck.

Jose looks around. He sees a loose METAL BAR - part of the
carcass. He RIPS IT OFF and inserts the end on one of the
holding plates of the strapping system.

POOLSIDE----

                      DIVER
               Sir?

Sturckow signals the divers to stand by.

UNDERWATER---- Jose uses the metal bar as a lever and PULLS
WITH ALL HIS MIGHT. The holding plate gives, he rips it off
the seat, and FREES the ASCAN.
                                                            78.


Jose pulls him to a door and DESPERATELY TRIES TO FIT PAST
THE DOOR -- it's hard with someone else in his arms.

POOLSIDE---- The diver tries again.

                    DIVER (CONT'D)
          Sir, we think it's time.

Sturckow hesitates.

                      KALPANA
          Yes, go!

All divers SUBMERGE... and just as they disappear...

JOSE and his companion EMERGE! JOSE GASPS FOR AIR

Kalpana helps Jose out and he sits on the ground, exhausted.

                    STURCKOW
          Okay. Everyone good? We're gonna
          try that again... with a blindfold.

The helo emerges like a dripping nightmare.


EXT. NASA HEADQUARTERS, KALPANA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jose is carrying a pack of diapers. He could go to sleep NOW.

He walks by Kalpana's office, he leans on her door, they
share a silent look.

                    KALPANA
              (Re: the diapers)
          How are they doing?

                    JOSE
          I'd be lying if I told you I knew.

                    KALPANA
          Yeah, that happens. You okay? You
          look like you just killed somebody.

                    JOSE
          No, someone just tried to kill me.

                    KALPANA
          You know we would never let
          anything happen to you, right?.
          It's an exercise in trust.
                                                         79.


                       JOSE
             I would trust you more if you just
             gave me milk and cookies.

                       KALPANA
             Well, yeah. What we're trying to
             accomplish here is... scary
             stuff... On a good day I'm afraid
             we're all aiming to hop on a rocket
             with 2 million pounds of highly
             flammable fuel onboard.

                       JOSE
             What about a bad day?

She sighs.

                       KALPANA
             On a bad day I think about how we
             think we control everything. Our
             lives, our dreams. We get
             exhausted, we make sacrifices, and
             we think it is about wanting it
             hard enough. But life is
             mysterious, you know?

A charged beat.

                       KALPANA (CONT'D)
             Here's the thing, though. Once that
             ignition sequence starts... We only
             have each other. That matters. I
             saw what you did today, as a member
             of this division... knowing that
             someone like you has my back is the
             most I can hope for.

Jose nods. He'll take that. She is about to go, but then:

Kalpana gets up, gets her stuff. Prepares to leave.

She nods, he smiles. A silent pact.

                       KALPANA (CONT'D)
                 (Re: diapers)
             I saw those on sale at Costco. FYI.

And she walks away.
                                                         80.


INT. HOUSTON HOME - DAY

"Tu carcel" by Los Bukis. SMOKING HOT COMAL. WARM TORTILLAS.
FRIJOLES ON A PAN. TOMATO GETS CHOPPED. Adela cooks up a
storm! Jose assists her.

LATER----

A lively celebration over a delicious meal. Around the table:
Jose, Adela, Kalpana, her husband JEAN-PIERRE, THREE ASCANS
(one blond woman and two men). The banter is loud and
friendly and messy.

                      KALPANA
            He's meaner than he means to be.

                      FEMALE ASCAN
            No way, Sturckow's a mean person
            all around.

                      KALPANA
            Trust me, it takes time, you'll
            warm up to him.

                     JOSE
          Not if you're his co-pilot.
           EVERYONE                        ASCAN 1
Ooooooooohhhhhhh!!!!!           Still messing with those comm
                                buttons, Hernandez!?

They all laugh.

                    JOSE
          I'm telling you the thing was
          stuck!
           ASCAN 2                         ASCAN 1
You made it stuck!              You locked it into getting
                                "stuck"

                      KALPANA
            Has he always been this stubborn?

Adela nods, smiles and rolls her eyes.

                      ADELA
            I think you guys are all stubborn,
            by the way.

Jose grabs and raises a beer. He clinks his fork on the glass
to call for a toast.
                                                  81.


                    JOSE
          Here's to Kalpana, who broke all
          the molds, opened a path, and is
          the most stubborn of us all.

                    KALPANA
          Well, I guess there will be no
          better time than this...

Kalpana gets up and spills it out.

                    KALPANA (CONT'D)
          You're looking at a Mission
          Specialist on the upcoming STS-107
          flight.

The ASCANS clap and whoo.

Jose looks at her with all his admiration.

                    KALPANA (CONT'D)
          Yeah, just... Thanks!

                    ADELA
          Congratulations!

                    KALPANA
          Whoa. WHOA! I don't---- I don't know
          what to say!

                    JOSE
          How are you feeling?

                     KALPANA
          Ah, let's see... Exhilarated?
          Ecstatic? Absolutely, positively
          terrified?

                    JOSE
          Never thought I'd even have a beer
          with an astronaut. Ever.

                    KALPANA
          How about you don't say anything
          and give me one.

                    JOSE
          You can have all of them! Salud!

He BEAMS. They drink.

A beat.
                                                            82.


                    KALPANA
              (re: Adela)
          What about YOU?

                    ADELA
          What do you mean?

                    KALPANA
          I don't know.... Like in the few
          moments in life you're not helping
          this guy with his own obsessive
          career choice, what do you dream
          of... for you?

Adela has an audience now... she's not used to this. She
looks at Jose.

                    ADELA
          Well I always dreamed of having a
          restaurant.

A beat.

                    KALPANA
          That explains it! I'm not joking,
          this is one of the best meals I've
          had in my life.

                    ADELA
          This? Nah! This is nothing. I'm
          guessing you've never tasted an
          uchepo.

Kalpana shakes her head.

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          Un uchepo is a soft tamal, from
          where our families are from,
          Michoacan. It's my childhood
          wrapped in a corn husk. It can be
          salty, but it can also be sweet. It
          can be a main course or a dessert.
          It is full of possibilities---- It's
          soft, tender, perfectly heated corn
          that melts in your mouth...
              (she stops)
          I know it's not space travel but----

                    FEMALE ASCAN
          That sounds like it beats the hell
          out of space travel!

Banter as they all agree and compliment her.
                                                           83.


Jose looks at her, feeling a little selfish.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Jose RUNS down a street. He STOPS in front of an empty store
and gets fixated on a sign that says: FOR LEASE.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, KIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kids are asleep. Jose kisses them one by one. When he gets to
Julio's bed, he lays beside him, face up, and sees:

His lighted Earth project.

Then he looks at Julio, peacefully sleeping beside him.


EXT. OUTER SPACE - NIGHT

The backdrop is PLANET EARTH, looking gorgeous and blue and
cloudy. A perfect ball containing all of humanity. Orbiting
around it is the International Space Station. We approach it
slowly and precisely.

CHATTER is heard over the radio, offering coordinates, flight
paths, speeds and instructions... Then we land on...

JOSE, in full astronaut gear, FOCUSED in the cockpit.

                    JOSE
          Houston, ISS in sight, initiating
          docking protocol.

He flips switches, he turns knobs, and he holds the tiny side
stick with utter delicacy -- two fingers -- adding little bits
of THRUST here and there.

The SOUNDS are otherworldly, high-tech, ominous and exciting.
The ISS comes closer and closer. And closer.

                     GROUND CONTROL
          Jose, you're coming in too hot,
          reduce speed or abort docking if
          necessary.

                    JOSE
          Negative, Houston, no need to
          abort.

                    GROUND CONTROL
          Jose, your speed----
                                                            84.


                     JOSE
           I got it, Houston. Please trust
           that I got it.

More thrust, less thrust, adjustments. The docking radar
RETRACTS. He's close now. He slows down to a riveting crawl.

JOSE'S EYES WIDEN as the Space Station floats right in front
of him... It looks like it's made of shiny gold.

He sweats. He pushes the shuttle in a little closer, INCHES
AWAY... ALARMS GO OFF. BEEPING. WARNINGS. AND HE DOCKS. All
lights turn GREEN. And he LOCKS IT.

Silence.

                     JOSE (CONT'D)
           Houston. We are now docked and
           locked. Thank you for your
           patience.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, SIMULATOR - MOMENTS LATER

A HATCH opens on a huge SIMULATOR sitting in NASA's Alpha
Dome. Everyone was watching on screens. Jose emerges.

                     JOSE
           Sir, I am happy to report that I am
           not dead.

Sturckow walks to the bottom of the stairs and meets him
privately.

                     STURCKOW
           Great job, Hernandez.

They shake hands.


EXT. STREET - LATER

Jose leads a BLINDFOLDED Adela down the sidewalk. The entire
family -- JULIO, KIDS, follow right behind.

                     JOSE
           Not yet, Julito.

                     ADELA
           Where are you taking me???

They all make a formation around her.
                                                          85.


                     JOSE
           Okay. Ready?

                     ADELA
           Yes, I'm ready! You're making me
           nervous!

                     JOSE
           Okay, kids, give me a countdown.
           Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
           five...

The kids take over: four, three, two, one -- Jose takes the
blindfold off!

The EMPTY STORE Jose saw earlier.

                     ADELA
           I don't understand.

                     JOSE
           Do you like it? Should we...?

Jose then walks to the door, takes the "For lease" sign down
and replaces it with one -- made by the kids -- that reads
"TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT".

Adela is stunned.

TV FOOTAGE----

The launch site at Kennedy Space Center. PRESS has gathered
to watch a major event. The SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA CREW
-- including KALPANA -- walks out of a building, waving to the
cameras.

                     NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
           And here is the crew, coming out of
           their quarters and boarding the
           vehicle that will take them to the
           Space Shuttle. All of the
           astronauts are suited up. A day
           they will remember, that's for
           certain.


INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, SPACE SHUTTLE - DAY

A TEAM of MISSION SUPERVISORS waits for the crew to board the
Space Shuttle. Among them is JOSE. It's a solemn and quiet
moment of protocols and safety.
                                                         86.


                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          Anticipation is high at Kennedy
          Space Center this morning, as Space
          Shuttle Columbia prepares for its
          journey to the ISS.


INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - MOMENTS LATER

The crew takes their respective seats. It is Jose's job to
secure their seat belts. RADIO COMM is heard in the
background as final CHECKLISTS are corroborated.

Kalpana's turn to be STRAPPED IN. Jose secures her. He stares
at his friend -- and HOLDS HER HAND.

                     KALPANA
          It took me nine tries to get in.
              (beat)
          My skin was also an odd color for
          many. You know how important it is
          that someone like us jumps into
          this ride?
              (she smiles)
          We come from tenacious people.
          Tenacity IS a superpower.

He smiles and nods.

                    JOSE
          Tenacity is a superpower.


INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, SPACE SHUTTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Jose, aided by members of his team, SHUTS THE HATCH. It feels
and sounds so... FINAL.


INT. TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT, MAIN FLOOR - DAY

An out-of-this-world sauce boils inside a clay pot.

Adela teaches a COOK how to make tortillas, she comes out the
kitchen:

The main floor has been TRANSFORMED into a REAL RESTAURANT
now, with CUSTOMERS and EVEN A WAITRESS, there's MUSIC and
CHATTER.

TWO ICE COLD MODELOS are served on a customer's table by Jose
who is completely glued to the TV screen on the wall.
                                                          87.


                    CUSTOMER
          Hey Jose, when will it be you?

                    JOSE
          As soon as I'm done with the onion
          back there!

Jose grabs the remote, and TURNS THE VOLUME UP.

The customers look up and listen in. It's KALPANA -- floating
inside the Space Station.

ON JOSE, watching with a yearning look.

                     NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          Astronaut Kalpana Chawla just a few
          days ago broadcasting from the ISS
          -- As you know this is a hugely
          important day for NASA and the
          Space Shuttle Columbia as they
          prepare to make their re-entry into
          the atmosphere 16 days after
          departure.

The TV just shows an EMPTY SKY.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          Launch and re-entry are the two
          points we worry about most, as you
          know.

ON THE TV: A map of the US and the expected trajectory over
Texas.

Julio barges into the restaurant.

                    JULIO
          I don't see anything, Dad!

                    JOSE
          Keep looking, son, you might just
          catch it.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          If you happen to hear a BOOM today,
          you may have gotten lucky and heard
          the space shuttle as it re-enters.

ON THE TV: Shots of HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL.

Again, the sky, empty.

Jose frowns and sits down.
                                                            88.


                    JULIO
          What's the matter, dad?

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          Fourteen minutes to touchdown.
          Flight controllers continue to
          stand by to regain communication.

                    TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
          Columbia Houston Comm Check...
          Columbia Houston Comm Check...

CLOSE ON Jose, worried.

                    TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
          Columbia Houston Comm Check, over.

                    JOSE
          They should have communication by
          now.

                    TECHNICIAN (V.O.)
          Columbia Houston UHF Comm Check,
          over.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          What we're hearing, as I'm told is
          the flight controllers in Houston
          as they seek tracking or
          communication with Columbia. Last
          contact was at 1pm Central Time...
          Flight director Leroy Cain is now
          instructing controllers to get out
          their contingency procedures.

ON JOSE -- total dread.

ON THE TV: A METEOR LIKE SHUTTLE STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          And there it is! Let's look at this
          picture from one of our affiliates
          in Dallas, Texas, it looks like----
          I see multiple trails coming down.
          I see multiple---- Let's hope to
          God... We're waiting for a official
          word...

Jose, white as a ghost, grabs the remote, and TURNS IT OFF.

                     JULIO
          Dad?
                                                           89.


                       ADELA
             What's the matter?!

                       JOSE
             I have to go.

                       JULIO
             But I wanna see the landing!

                       JOSE
             IT'S NOT GONNA LAND NOW!

Everyone in the restaurant is startled, confused.

                       JOSE (CONT'D)
             Keep that TV off!

And he RUNS out the door.


INT. CAR, MOVING - LATER

Jose drives FAST -- His hands are shaking as he TURNS ON THE
RADIO -- music, he switches stations and lands on the NEWS:

                       NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
             Debris now covering an area of over
             300 miles across Texas, search and
             rescue operation is currently
             underway. Based on eyewitness
             accounts and sources at NASA, we
             can now confirm there are
             unfortunately... no survivors.

Jose pulls over, distraught. He turns off the radio.

He sits there, trying to breathe. He looks disoriented,
agitated. He steps out of the car.

CLOSE ON JOSE---- He looks out at the space around him. In
front of him: a big field, a few WORKERS in it.

TV FOOTAGE

-- SEARCH AND RESCUE WORKERS comb through fields, forests and
lakes, identifying and marking pieces of fuselage.

                       STURCKOW (V.O.)
             Through countless hours of research
             we have concluded that during the
             launch of STS-107...

-- POLICE CARS parked on the side of the road, cordoned off
with YELLOW TAPE.
                                                            90.


                    STURCKOW (V.O.)
          ... A piece of foam insulation
          broke off from the external tank
          and struck the left wing of the
          orbiter.

-- A MEMORIAL SERVICE. FLAG flies at half mast. MOURNERS wipe
tears. PICTURES OF THE COLUMBIA CREW are featured on the
stage.

                    STURCKOW (V.O.)
          When Columbia re-entered the
          atmosphere, the damage allowed hot
          gases to penetrate the heat shield
          and destroy internal wing
          structure...


INT. NASA HANGAR - DAY

A HUGE HANGAR where shuttle pieces are arranged into an
outline of the Columbia.

Jose confused, in obvious pain, and other ENGINEERS sift
through the debris.



                    STURCKOW (V.O.)
          This caused the spacecraft to
          become unstable... and break apart.
          I want to thank you all for your
          tireless work and contributions to
          the Investigation Board.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A very serious Sturckow, wrapping up this presentation for
NASA.

                    STURCKOW
          I think it's safe to assume these
          results will bring added scrutiny
          from DC. I for one won't argue
          against them. If we can't make
          space flight safe, we shouldn't be
          doing it at all.

Sturckow looks around the group. He locks eyes with Jose.

                    STURCKOW (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, guys.
                                                         91.


A somber mood as he exits the room.


EXT. NASA HEADQUARTERS, KALPANA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jose stands in the door frame, remembering, observing the
empty room. Kalpana's soul still there.

He walks out.

Jose walks the corridor, looking small.


INT. TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT, MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

Jose sits by himself, lost in thought. His father, Salvador,
in front of him.

Adela looks at them, empathetic.

She lights a candle in a small and heartwarmingly arranged
altar: Kalpana's picture, flowers and a Virgen de Guadalupe.

                    JOSE
          She told me life was mysterious and
          I didn't quite understood what she
          was saying. This is when it gets
          scary, dad.

A long beat.

                     SALVADOR
          The thing is, though... it's not
          just a stupid dream anymore, Jose.
          It's your life. This is the path
          you chose.

He looks at him, deeply. Jose looks at Adela a few feet away.

                     JOSE
          I already won.
              (beat)
          I don't think I need anything else.
          I got you and mom. I got Adela. I
          won, right here. And I won five
          more times with the most beautiful
          children.

Salvador just stays quiet, looks at his son.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          You don't think this all means I
          should quit?
                                                          92.


Salvador's watery eyes fixed on him.

He softly shakes his head.


EXT. HOUSTON HOME, DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Jose looks at the stars playing with his corn rocket in his
hands.

He takes a big breath and heads to the door, but when he's
about to go in he comes back and throws the thing away, with
all of his strength.

The improvised toy flies through the dark street until it
gets lost.

Chyron: 2008


EXT. STREET - DAY

Jose runs fast. Concentrated.


INT. NASA HANGAR - DAY

Jose in a Nasa uniform, examines some turbine samples.


INT. TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT, STOREFRONT - NIGHT

Jose carries a couple of bags out to the trash bins. He looks
back. Adela smiles at him from inside.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON A SLICED BIRTHDAY CAKE -- and a burned candle # 13
laying on the plate. A "Feliz cumplea�os, Julio" sign half-
hanging.

THE PHONE RINGS in the distance. Jose sits and watches the
party's aftermath... his sons unwrapped birthday presents. A
TELESCOPE among them.

                    ADELA O.S.
          Jose. Phone for you.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, HALLWAY - DAY

Jose, in a tie and suit, sits in a hallway next to four other
MEN, and one WOMAN -- all equally nervous.
                                                           93.


                    JOSE
          What time did you get the call?

                    ASCAN 1
          Almost midnight.

                    OLIVAS
          You think they're dismantling the
          program?

                    ASCAN 2
          So kind of them to make us dress up
          for it. Fancy final good bye.

                    JOSE
          Sturckow sounded concerned...

Sturckow himself opens an office door and pops his head out.

                       STURCKOW
          Hernandez.

Jose takes a deep breath, stands up... and walks in.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, MEETING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jose sits on one side of a long conference table, alone. On
the other side, like a death squad, are Sturckow, Program
Director Robert D. CABANA, and four more high ranking
OFFICIALS. Tons of paperwork before them.

                    CABANA
          Mr. Hernandez, I don't believe
          we've met. I am Flight Crew
          Operations Director Colonel Cabana.
          Took you a while to get here,
          didn't it? You're a rare kind of
          bird.

Jose remains quiet.

                    CABANA (CONT'D)
          You're here today because against
          our expectations, NASA has cleared
          a new shuttle launch, and we want
          to get things moving before
          Washington changes their mind.
              (A beat)
          After reviewing your file... I
          would like you to join the Space
          Shuttle Mission Discovery.

Jose is speechless. A blank face.
                                                           94.


                    CABANA (CONT'D)
          Hernandez. We understand that the
          Columbia crew were your friends.
          Following a tragedy like that with
          further space flight is no small
          burden. So we need to know: Are you
          up for the task?

They look at him. He looks at them. What can he possibly say?
His mind is racing at the speed of light.

                       CABANA (CONT'D)
          Hernandez?

                    STURCKOW
          Hernandez. We need to hear----


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jose washes his face. He looks at the mirror, breathing
deeply. About to faint.

He looks down to his sweaty hands.

He takes a moment.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, MEETING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jose re-enters the room. His head up. Sturckow, Cabana and
the rest of officials raise their gazes.

                       STURCKOW
          Well?

                    JOSE
          I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Sir.
          I had to take a moment. I've been
          waiting for this for almost 30
          years.

Cabana clears his throat.

                    STURCKOW
          And your answer?

                     JOSE
          My answer, is...
              (beat)
          Yes. Of course is yes, but still...
          I'll have to ask my wife.

He laughs as a tear comes out from one of his eyes.
                                                          95.


                    STURCKOW
          I'm assigning you Mission
          Specialist Two. I want you right up
          front between me and the pilot.
          Congratulations.

They shake hands. Sturckow slides a clear plastic bag
containing Jose's very own BLUE FLIGHT SUIT on the table. He
looks at it.

Sturckow and Cabana share a look, Jose smiles.


INT. TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT, MAIN FLOOR - DAY

Busy lunch at Tierra Luna. Adela emerges from the kitchen,
carrying two plates of their hit Uchepos dish. She places the
plates on a CUSTOMER'S table. She turns and moves toward the
table, but SUDDENLY------ SHE SEES SOMETHING OUT THE WINDOW AND
FREEZES MID WALK:

JOSE, SMILING, STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS DOOR.
WEARING HIS FULL BODY BLUE FLIGHT SUIT. Flag on his shoulder,
NASA logo on his upper chest, and below it, his name sewn on:

"JOSE M. HERNANDEZ"

Adela DROPS THE PITCHER. It BREAKS, water SPILLS. Place is
now SILENT. Customers mumble -- what's going on?

Adela BOLTS out of the restaurant, and JUMPS into Jose's
arms. Then she grabs his face, looks right into this eyes:

                    ADELA
          How do you---- Do you---- I don't----
          What? What are you doing dressed
          like that? Is this a joke?

                     JOSE
          What do you think? Should we do
          this? I still can call the whole
          thing off.

                       ADELA
          Oh my god!

Adela starts crying.

                    JOSE
          What's the matter?

A beat.
                                                          96.


                    ADELA
          The dishwasher didn't show.

They both burst into laughter in a fit of mixed and
immeasurable emotion.

Their daughter Karina walks out the door and stares at him:

                    ADELA (CONT'D)
          How do you like papi's new uniform,
          honey?

                    KARINA
          He looks like PAPA SMURF.


INT. TIERRA LUNA RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jose works the dishwashing station like nobody's business, in
full NASA flight uniform!


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Jose sits at a press conference with the other ASTRONAUTS as
Program Director Cabana reads out their names.

                    CABANA
          It's my honor to present to you the
          Space Shuttle Mission Discovery's
          crew: Commander Frederick Sturckow,
          Pilot Kevin Ford. Mission
          Specialists Patrick Forrester.
          Christer Fuglesang. John Olivas.
          Nicole Stott. And Jose Hernandez.

CAMERAS FLASH!! It's intense. A room full of REPORTERS
screaming over each other.

                    CABANA (CONT'D)
          One at a time, please.


INT. HERNANDEZ HOME - DAY

PUSH INTO Julia and Salvador watching. Lety and Chava try to
connect the antenna cord, but no luck. The image looks
somewhat distorted, but that doesn't take Salvador's and
Julia's attention off the screen. They are utterly proud.

                                                          97.


A REPORTER on the TV:

                    REPORTER
          Is it true that you grew up as a
          migrant farmworker in California?

                    JOSE
          Yes, I did. And who better than a
          migrant to leave this planet, and
          dive into the unknown, right?

                     REPORTER # 2
           Is it true you applied 12 times
           before you were accepted into the

Do you have a message for the    Did you always dream of this
Mexican people?                  moment? Was this a childhood
                                 dream?

PRESS MAYHEM continues. The other astronauts look over and
smile, as the spotlight seems to fall exclusively on Jose.


EXT. HOUSTON HOME, BACKYARD - SAME

PEACE. Out here it's just crickets... Jose watches his son
looking through the telescope. He knows what he's doing now --
focusing, shifting, panning. He's almost a teenager.

                    JULIO
          Dad? Did you know that Halley's
          Comet will orbit past Earth again
          in 2061?

                    JOSE
          I didn't.
              (A beat)
          How do you know?

                    JULIO
          I researched it.

Ha. Crickets.

                    JULIO (CONT'D)
          I need to ask you something.

Julio disengages from the telescope and sits next to his dad.
His face worried.

                    JOSE
          What?
                                                     98.


                    JULIO
          You know what.

Beat. He knows what.

                    JOSE
          I'm gonna be in the hands of the
          most capable, most brilliant
          scientists and engineers in the
          world...

                      JULIO
          But---- there's still a chance...

Jose just stares out into the sky.

                     JOSE
          Space travel is... It's very, very
          unlikely. But yes, it is extremely
          dangerous.

                    JULIO
          I... Should anything happen, I
          promise I'll take care of mom, and
          my sisters... and my brother.

Jose pulls him in very close and holds him tight.

                    JOSE
          Should anything happen, if you
          don't keep your promise I'll come
          back to pull your legs in your
          sleep!

They laugh.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          Now, tell me more about Halley's
          comet's return.

                    JULIO (O.S.)
          It's gonna happen in July 2061.
          That means I'll be 74 years old.

                    JOSE (O.S.)
          Oh, well, I will come back a
          jalarte las patas in your sleep by
          then, for sure!
                                                           99.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, BEDROOM - DAWN

Barely dusk. We see two silhouettes against a window: Jose
and Adela cuddle together. They say nothing as the sun slowly
comes up.

                    JOSE
          I want your ring with me.

A beat.

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
          I want your ring next to mine. Our
          rings should be together.

She nods, trying her best not to cry but it's no use... He
slides the wedding band off her finger, and holds it. They
hold on to each other tight, as if they would never, ever let
go. For a long time. Finally, she gives him the ring.

                    ADELA
          If you lose that ring I'll kill
          you. I mean it. I will kill you
          with my bare hands.

She holds his face as they look deep into each other's eyes.


EXT. HOUSTON HOME, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

A BLACK, unmarked NASA GOVERNMENT SUV awaits with the door
open. A DRIVER closes the door behind him.

Jose hugs Adela, then comes close to his kids.

                    JOSE
          Hey, kids. Did you know Monarch
          butterflies' journey is so long, it
          takes them several generations to
          get there? The butterfly that
          starts the journey in Canada won't
          be the one enjoying Mexico's
          warmth... but its descendants. You
          know who taught me that?

Salvador smiles.

Jose goes to his mother and father and gives them a big
loving hug ----

                    JOSE (CONT'D)
              (to Salvador)
          Are you crying, Dad?
                                                        100.


                     SALVADOR
           No, mijo, it's just some dirt got
           into my eye.

Jose smiles and gets in the car.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH GROUNDS - DAY

Like an OTHERWORLDLY GIANT making an entrance, Space Shuttle
Discovery and its ROCKETS roll out of a hangar on a mobile
launch platform. This is Jose's ride.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, OPERATIONS BUILDING - MOMENTS
LATER

The astronauts are led by STAFF down a long hallway.

Jose can't help but notice the huge POSTERS of space travel
LEGENDS: JOHN GLENN. NEIL ARMSTRONG. SALLY RIDE. FRANKLIN
CHANG. ELLEN OCHOA. JOHN OLIVAS. SIDNEY GUTIERREZ. GEORGE
ZAMKA. KALPANA CHAWLA.

ON JOSE ---- moved...


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - DAY

Adela, the kids, Salvador and Julia arrive. They step out of
a large van, and boy is it a LOUD MESS as usual. Adela
wrestles with the kids.

Salvador and Julio share a look. They walk away from the
pack, take a few steps towards the gardens... and take in the
view: The Space Shuttle.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, ASTRONAUT QUARTERS - DAY

Jose enters his bedroom. It's bland and simple: bare walls, a
single bed, a wardrobe, a TV set and a tiny bathroom. He puts
his duffle bag down... and sits on his bed.

A member of the STAFF knocks.

                     STAFF
           Mr. Hernandez, your wife is
           waiting.
                                                        101.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, VISITOR'S LOUNGE - DAY

A big room divided by a GLASS WALL. Jose enters and sees
Adela sitting on the other side. He comes close. Their voices
are amplified for each other through loudspeakers.

                    ADELA
          How are you feeling?

                      JOSE
          Good.

Silence. He smiles.

                    ADELA
          Your parents brought you a
          surprise.

                      JOSE
          Oh yeah?

Adela stands and walks towards the door. Jose sits patiently,
watching through the glass.

Adela opens the door and exits the room for a moment. Then
she peeks again.

                      ADELA
          Ready?

Adela enters the room, followed by the most unexpected guest:
MISS YOUNG! -- Jose's school teacher, now in her 60's.

JOSE IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED.

                    MISS YOUNG
          Well, hello there, young man.

                      JOSE
          I don't---- I don't know what to say.

                    MISS YOUNG
          Nice to see you, Miss Young. We
          could start there.

                      JOSE
          How---- How did you find me?

                    MISS YOUNG
          I don't know, The New York Times?
          You're not exactly hard to find
          these days. But it was actually
          your parents who found me.
                                                           102.


                    JOSE
          Thank you. Thank you for being
          here.

Jose looks down.

                    MISS YOUNG
          I've been waiting for this moment
          for more than 30 years. And I have
          proof.

Miss Young's shaky hands rummage through her purse... and she
produces a piece of paper... and she unfolds it.

IT'S THE COMPOSITION JOSE ONCE GAVE HER OUTSIDE HIS HOME. A
corn rocket standing upright. And inside it, at the very top,
a little boy.

                    MISS YOUNG (CONT'D)
          One of my most prized possessions.

She smiles. He's fighting back tears.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - SAME

Past open doors with FAMILIES watching the SAME NEWSCAST -- a
NAME ON EACH DOOR:

"STURCKOW" -- Polite midwestern family quietly listens.

"FORD" -- A gentle buzz in this CROWD, soft music playing.

"STOTT" -- A MAN opens a bottle of champagne.

We begin the hear the HERNANDEZ RUMBLE as we approach the
last door of the hallway, and we move INSIDE THE ROOM: LIVELY
COMMOTION. The room is PACKED with FRIENDS and FAMILY - Kids
jump on the beds.

We land on Salvador and Adela, TERRIFIED, watching the
NEWSCAST.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          Another historic day for NASA and
          the Nation, as Space Shuttle
          Discovery prepares for launch in a
          journey towards the ISS, currently
          orbiting 320 miles above Earth.
                                                           103.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, MEDICAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jose sits in an undershirt as the STAFF DOCTOR checks his
blood pressure.


INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, CONTROL CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A million SCREENS, RADARS and STAFF in last minute prep mode
for imminent launch.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, HERNANDEZ FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Salvador gives Julia a shot of tequila; she DOWNS it
immediately. Adela is still glued to the screen.
           SALVADOR                        SALVADOR
Te sirvo uno a ti tambien,     Can I pour one for you, dear?
mija?

Adela nods, unable to speak. She downs the tequila.

The kids are at the back. Marisa sits by Adela, they half
hug.

Salvador looks at his hands.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CHECKOUT BUILDING - LATER

Jose's hands covered by gloves.

SUIT TECHNICIANS finish dressing Jose in his orange launch
suit.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CHECKOUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

The astronauts enter an ASTRONAUT TRANSFER VAN one by one.


INT. ASTROVAN, MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

Jose sits by a window, looking out. He sees a series of
tarmacs, hangars and NASA STAFF.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

TV FOOTAGE of the Astrovan moving as the NEWSCAST continues.
                                                           104.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, HERNANDEZ FAMILY ROOM - SAME

EVERYONE huddled around the TV.

Adela stands up to loud PROTESTS. But she won't budge. She
stands by the window. What she sees scares her even more:

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING in the distance -- THUNDERSTORMS.


INT. ASTROVAN, MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

Jose, still looking out the window, when all of a sudden, the
van stops. The launch pad is not even in sight.

The astronauts exchange looks of concern.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, HERNANDEZ FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A LOUD DISCUSSION -- why did they stop? Salvador joins Adela
by the window.


INT. ASTROVAN - MOMENTS LATER

The astronauts sit patiently. Over their loudspeakers:

                     FLIGHT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
          Discovery Crew, Flight Director
          here, Houston has detected
          unforeseen, unfavorable weather
          conditions. We have determined that
          the current launch sequence is a no
          go. Repeat, launch is a no go until
          further notice. You will return to
          base -- your quarantine is back in
          effect.

On Jose's look of DISAPPOINTMENT.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, ASTRONAUT QUARTERS - LATER

Jose and the astronauts play cards. Others kick a hacky-sack.

Sturckow comes into the room, he sits down, everyone gets
close to him as he makes an announcement:

                    STURCKOW
          Guys. Launch is pushed back till
          Friday now. The defective fuel
          control valve is being replaced as
          we speak.
                                                         105.


Silence. Wow.

                    JOSE
          Main or back up?

                      STURCKOW
          Main.

Glances are exchanged...

                    JOSE
          Wow... What if we'd gone up like
          that?

A beat.

                    STURCKOW
          Well... we didn't.

Sturckow leaves. They all share concerned looks.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jose tosses and turns -- can't sleep. Looks out the window.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          They detected it. We're safe.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          But it shouldn't have happened in
          the first place.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          You have to trust them.

                    ADELA (V.O.)
          I know. And I do. But...

                      JOSE (V.O.)
          But what?


INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Adela sitting in the bathroom floor, talking to her cell.
Locked in.

                    ADELA
          I'm so scared.

                    JOSE (V.O.)
          Don't be. You know I'm in the best
          hands.
                                                        106.


                       ADELA
             I know... I know... Just---- What are
             you doing right now?

                       JOSE (V.O.)
             I'm staring at a picture of...
             Salma Hayek.

                       ADELA
             What?!


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jose, laughing on the phone, sits on the floor against his
bed. He is staring at a picture of Salma.

                       JOSE
             The guys slipped it under my door.
             They fake signed it and all. It
             says: "Thank you for going to
             space, my hero"... So dumb...

                       ADELA (V.O.)
             That's stupid.

                        JOSE
             You think she would want to meet an
             Astronaut?

                       ADELA (V.O.)
             Salma? Totally.

A long beat.

                       ADELA (V.O.)
             You go and come back to her safely,
             please.

He smiles.

                       JOSE
             I want to ask for a favor.

                       ADELA
             Anything, baby.

                       JOSE
             Tell my dad I'm sorry they lost the
             house in Michoacan.

Adela wipes tears and snot. This is so hard.

Jose closes his eyes.
                                                           107.


I/E. SALVADOR'S CAR -- SUNSET

Jose and his brothers and sister dirty, tired. Salvador
looking at them through the rearview.


INT. ADELA'S - NIGHT

Their first date. Her TWO UNCLES. Jose and Adela look into
each other's eyes -- their HANDS TOUCH.


EXT. STOCKTON -- NIGHT

Jose and Beto share a beer on the hood of the lowrider.

Jose's bare childhood hands deep into the earth.

They pick a cob of corn. They feel its texture.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, KIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jose walks into the kids' room, and watches them sleep.

He sees Julio's GEOLOGICAL SYSTEM.


INT. HOUSTON HOME, BEDROOM - DAWN

Jose and Adela, cuddling in that armchair, after taking
Adela's ring. Adela's eyes.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Back to Jose's quarters... CLUTCHING that ring in his hand.

                    ADELA
          Please come home.

                       JOSE
          I will.

He lays on the floor, still on the phone... and tries to go
to sleep.


EXT. FIELDS, STOCKTON NIGHT

CLOSE ON JOSE as he opens his eyes. He still lays on the
ground, but he notices it's DIRT. He looks up and sees:
                                                        108.


Under a strange starry sky, the fields are brightly
illuminated by the moonlight. SALVADOR, picking strawberries,
his rugged hands moving swiftly like firing pistons. Jose
turns and sees his mother, doing the same. He hears someone
behind him and he discovers Adela, picking strawberries too.
But then he sees someone else: Right beside her... his son
JULIO, face dirty, is picking berry after berry. Then he sees
his baby girls helping out too. And Beto. And his aunts and
uncles. And his grandparents. And his great grandparents...

And as we GLIDE UP above him, we discover an endless field
covered with Mexican workers -- past, present and future.
Monarch butterflies fly all around them.

Back on the horizon, a rocket is being prepared. The engines
turn on, the fire propels it, and it shoots up into the
starry sky.

THERE'S A KNOCK.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - MORNING

Jose WAKES UP on the floor. The staff member speaks from the
other side of the door.

                    STAFF (O.S.)
          Mr. Hernandez. It's time.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH GROUNDS - DAY

A caravan of vehicles with the Astrovan - moving closer to
the launchpad.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH PAD - DAY

A slow, seemingly endless tilt from the bottom of the Space
Shuttle Discovery and its huge steaming boosters, all the way
to its imposing top, as it sits on the launchpad, waiting for
Jose.

                    NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
          After several delays, it's only one
          hour and seven minutes until NASA
          begins its next adventure. If all
          goes well, Discovery astronauts are
          to lift off from pad 28 at Kennedy
          Space Center, on the voyage mankind
          cannot cease to dream about.
                                                         109.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, LAUNCH PAD, ELEVATOR - DAY

Jose stands in the elevator with the rest of the astronauts --
in full gear - as they make their way to the shuttle.
  REPORTERA MEXICANA (V.O.)       MEXICAN NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, ASSEMBLY HANGAR, ROOFTOP - DAY

Jose's family, the kids, Marisa, Salvador, Julia and Adela,
stand together, watching in anxious anticipation. Adela is
not feeling well, she's pale, about to faint.


INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

Jose is helped into his GLOVES and HELMET by the SUIT
TECHNICIANS. Jose's helmet fits nice and snug.

CLICK.


EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, ASSEMBLY HANGAR, ROOFTOP - DAY

Salvador and Julia are holding each other in silence.

Julio steps away from the crowd... he gazes over the
launchpad, then to his mom.

                    JULIO
          Mom, are you ok?

Adela shakes her head.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - DAY

A NASA OFFICER takes Adela to Jose's room. She looks
terrible. She sits on the bed.

                    ADELA
          I'll be fine.

She breathes deeply.
                                                           110.


INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - DAY

The astronauts take their places. RADIO CHATTER is intense.
Status checks on boosters, flight dynamics, etc, etc.

ON JOSE -- as he pins THREE PICTURES on the side of his
control panel: Salvador and Julia... Adela and the kids...
Beto and himself.

The CLOSE-OUT CHIEF buckles Jose. He gives Jose a thumbs up.
Jose nods.

                    LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
          Discovery, this is Launch
          Operations Manager. The launch team
          wishes you good luck and godspeed.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - DAY

Adela continues breathing, her shaking eases a bit. She turns
to see Jose's board: the picture of Salma and her fake
autograph hanging there. She laughs a little.

Stands up and goes to the window. She can see the enormous
shuttle from there.


INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - DAY

Jose's eyes. The MAIN HATCH is CLOSED... And LOCKED. The
astronauts look at each other.

                    LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
          We have completed power transfer,
          we are still a go, 35 seconds and
          counting. Astronauts report it
          feels good, T--minus 25 seconds.

-- A room full of NASA techs and engineers sit nervously at
Control Center.

-- CLOSE ON... ADELA. SALVADOR. JULIA. JULIO.

-- And... JOSE, inside the shuttle. Ready for take off.

                     LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
          T--minus 15 seconds, second stage
          tanks now pressurized... 12, 11,
          10, 9... Ignition sequence starts.

BOOM! A BALL OF FIRE is spat into the camera as the engines
IGNITE.
                                                         111.


                        LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
           5, 4, 3...

The base of the launch pad LIGHTS UP like a bomb, the rocket
ROARS, FURIOUS!

                      LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
           2, 1, ZERO... All engines running!

JOSE's eyes WIDEN.

The ARMS of the platform LET GO, disengaging as the rocket
RATTLES like a moving high-rise.

                     LAUNCH CONTROL (V.O.)
           Lift off! We have lift off on Space
           Shuttle Discovery!

INSIDE---- the shuttle RUMBLES, Jose and the astronauts SHAKE
in their seats.

THEY RISE INTO THE SKY.


INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, JOSE'S ROOM - DAY

Adela covers her mouth in awe, as she admires the take off.


VARIOUS

The shuttle FLIES on a HUGE TV SCREEN. THOUSANDS IN MEXICO
CHEER! We see WONDER on these faces: LOGAN. WEISSBERG.
STACEY. MISS YOUNG. ADELA. SALVADOR. JULIA. JULIO.


INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - SAME

LOUD. The shuttle RATTLES as the G-forces kick in.

ON JOSE -- his eyes wide, shaking as the roaring shuttle hurls
into space. He looks out the window -- the view suddenly dark
and filled with STARS.

The shaking stops... They've made it past the atmosphere...
It's QUIET. Jose sees an IMAGE:

A corn cob floats behind him and lingers before his face.
Jose stares in amazement and, suddenly, YOUNG JOSE sits
beside him, his beautiful face filled with AWE. And then...
YOUNG JOSE gently floats towards the window.

FROM OUTSIDE THE SHUTTLE----
                                                          112.


We see YOUNG JOSE'S FACE as the kid glues himself to the
glass... and takes in the majestic view.

Jose's eyes look down on Earth. It's beautiful.

`El hijo del pueblo' starts playing.



                                            FADE TO BLACK.




                          THE END.

Real footage of Jose floating in space, Jose eating a taco,
Jose being interviewed from the orbiting shuttle. The shuttle
landing in California. Jose's ACTUAL FAMILY celebrating.
Footage of MEXICAN PEOPLE celebrating in Mexico City. Footage
of Jose as HE AND THE CREW deplane and salute. A BEAUTIFUL
PORTRAIT OF JOSE, ADELA AND THEIR KIDS...


Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely in California on
September 11, 2009.

He also played Jose Alfredo Jimenez's ranchera: "El hijo del
pueblo" up there.

After leaving NASA in 2011, Jose started his own aerospace
engineering consulting firm: Tierra Luna Engineering.

Jose helped Mexico launch three Boeing communications
satellites into space, opening internet access to remote
parts of the country.

His son, Julio Hernandez, is working on his PhD in aerospace
engineering at Purdue. He wants to become an astronaut.

Jose still picks grapes with his father. Only this time they
own the vineyard.
