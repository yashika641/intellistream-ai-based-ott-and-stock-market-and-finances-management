1        EXT. NEW YORK, AMERICAN MINISTRY OF MAGIC 1927 (NIGHT)                           1

         AERIAL SHOT: New York and MACUSA building.


2        INT. MACUSA BASEMENT, BARE, BLACK-WALLED ROOM (NIGHT)                              2

         The long-haired, bearded GRINDELWALD sits motionless,
         magically fixed to a chair. The air shimmers, charged with
         spells.

         ABERNATHY peers in at GRINDELWALD from the corridor.

         A baby Chupacabra -- part lizard, part homunculus, a blood-
         sucking creature of the Americas -- is chained to
         GRINDELWALD'S chair.


3        INT. MACUSA, CORRIDOR BETWEEN CELLS - SHORTLY AFTER  (NIGHT) 3

         PRESIDENT SERAPHINA PICQUERY and RUDOLPH SPIELMAN walk at
         pace toward an ominous-looking door past endless pairs of
         guards.

                                 SPIELMAN
                            (Germanic)
                       ...you'll be glad to be rid of him,
                       I expect.

                                 PICQUERY
                       We'd be more than happy to keep him
                       here in custody.

                                 SPIELMAN
                       Six months are enough. It's time
                       for him to answer for his crimes in
                       Europe.

         As they reach the door, ABERNATHY turns and acknowledges
         them.

                                  ABERNATHY
                       President Picquery, Mr. Spielman,
                       sir. Prisoner is secured and ready
                       to travel.

         SPIELMAN and PICQUERY peer into the cell at GRINDELWALD.

                                 SPIELMAN
                       You've thrown everything at him, I
                       see.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 PICQUERY
                       It was necessary. He's extremely
                       powerful. We've had to change his
                       guard three times -- he's very...
                       persuasive. So we removed his
                       tongue.

         Cells resembling cages rise in tiers.

         Prisoners chant and bang against the bars as the bound
         GRINDELWALD is transported upstairs, suspended magically in
         midair.

                                 PRISONERS
                       Grindelwald! Grindelwald!


5        EXT. MACUSA ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER  (NIGHT)                                        5

         A hearse-like black carriage, drawn by eight THESTRALS,
         waits.

         AURORS 1 & 2 climb into the driver's seat, the rest force
         GRINDELWALD inside.

                                  SPIELMAN
                       The wizarding community worldwide
                       owes you a great debt, Madam
                       President.

                                 PICQUERY
                       Do not underestimate him.

         ABERNATHY approaches them.

                                 ABERNATHY
                       Mr. Spielman, we found his wand
                       hidden away.

         He hands over a black rectangular box.

                                     PICQUERY
                       Abernathy?

                                 ABERNATHY
                       And we found this.

         He holds a vial of some glowing gold substance in the palm of
         his hand.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)
    3.

5        CONTINUED:                                                                     5
         SPIELMAN reaches for the vial, which hangs on a chain, and
         after a moment of hesitation, ABERNATHY releases it.

         Inside the carriage, GRINDELWALD raises his eyes to the roof
         as the vial is passed to SPIELMAN.

         SPIELMAN climbs into the carriage. AUROR 1 driving, AUROR 2
         beside him. The door closes.

         A series of padlocks emerges from the carriage doors. An
         ominous drumroll of clicks as padlocks fasten themselves in
         place.

                                     AUROR 1
                       Yah!

         The Thestrals take off.

         The carriage plummets, then soars away through torrential
         rain. More AURORS follow on broomsticks.

         A beat.

         ABERNATHY steps forward, holding the Elder Wand. He looks up
         at the carriage, growing ever smaller. He Disapparates.

                                                                  CUT TO:


6        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               6

         The underside of the carriage.

         ABERNATHY Apparates, clinging to the wheel shaft.


7        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               7

         SPIELMAN and GRINDELWALD sit, eyes locked, flanked by AURORS,
         all pointing their wands at GRINDELWALD.

         GRINDELWALD'S wand box lies on SPIELMAN'S lap.

         SPIELMAN holds up the vial, dangling from its chain.

                                 SPIELMAN
                       No more silver tongue, eh?

         But GRINDELWALD is transforming...
     4.



8         EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               8

          ABERNATHY adjusts his grip underneath the carriage.

          His face too is changing. His hair is turning blond and
          lengthening... he is GRINDELWALD.

          He raises the Elder Wand.


9         INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                               9

          GRINDELWALD'S rapid transformation into a tongueless
          ABERNATHY is almost complete.

                                    SPIELMAN
                               (shocked)
                        Oh!


10        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          10

          Now fully transformed, GRINDELWALD Disapparates from the
          underside of the carriage...

          ...and Apparates next to the driver's seat, where he is
          spotted by AURORS 1 & 2. GRINDELWALD points his wand at the
          carriage reins, turning the black ropes into living snakes
          that ensnare AUROR 1 so he falls from the carriage, back
          through the night sky, past the broomstick riders.

          GRINDELWALD casts another spell so the black ropes of the
          reins bind AUROR 2 like a chrysalis, launching him forward in
          the air, then slingshotting him back to knock AURORS 3 & 4
          from the rear of the Thestral-drawn carriage. They fall away
          into darkness.


11        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          11

          All wands reverse their direction to jab dangerously at the
          necks of SPIELMAN and the two remaining AURORS.

          SPIELMAN watches as his wand melts into dust.

          The carriage rocks dangerously, both doors open. As
          GRINDELWALD'S head appears at the window, the panicking
          SPIELMAN opens the wand box on his lap.

          The Chupacabra leaps out and sinks its fangs deep into
          SPIELMAN'S neck. He wrestles it.

          The vial falls to the floor.
     5.



12        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          12

          GRINDELWALD drives the carriage down onto the Hudson River,
          chased by the AURORS on broomsticks.

          The carriage wheels graze the surface of the water. The
          broomstick riders are catching up.

          GRINDELWALD touches the Elder Wand to the river and at once
          the inside of the carriage begins to fill with water.

          He lifts the carriage back up into the air.


13        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          13

          Submerged in the water, the two AURORS, SPIELMAN, and
          ABERNATHY hold their breath.

          SPIELMAN attempts to grab the vial, which is floating loose
          in the water, but the Chupacabra blocks his path.

          ABERNATHY, with hands still bound, manages to capture the
          vial in his mouth.


14        EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          14

          Still driving the carriage, GRINDELWALD swirls his wand in
          the air toward the surrounding storm clouds.

          One by one, forks of lightning strike the broomstick riders,
          knocking each in turn from the sky.


15        INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE  (NIGHT)                                          15

          GRINDELWALD appears at the door and nods to ABERNATHY. He
          throws the door open so the water pours out -- along with the
          two remaining AURORS.

          GRINDELWALD clambers inside and retrieves the vial from
          ABERNATHY'S mouth by the chain, casting a spell that grants
          ABERNATHY a new forked tongue.

                                  GRINDELWALD
                        You have joined a noble cause, my
                        friend.

          GRINDELWALD rips the little Chupacabra off SPIELMAN. It rubs
          its bloody face affectionately against his hand.



                                                                               (CONTINUED)

15        CONTINUED:                                                                    15
                                  GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                        I know. Okay. I know, Antonio.

          He looks at it with distaste.

                                      GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                        So needy.

          He then flings it through the door.

          He blasts SPIELMAN magically through the open door, then
          tosses a wand after him.


16        EXT. SKY OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN  (NIGHT)                                          16
          As SPIELMAN falls, he manages to seize the wand and conjures
          an invisible Slowing Charm.

          Sinking slowly toward the sea, SPIELMAN watches his carriage
          streaking away in the direction of Europe.


17        EXT. OVERCAST LONDON, WHITEHALL - THREE MONTHS LATER -                        17
          AFTERNOON

          ESTABLISHING SHOT.

          A gloomy silence.

          An owl flutters down into the Ministry.


18        INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - AFTERNOON                                            18

          NEWT SCAMANDER sits alone in a dingy waiting area, staring
          abstractedly into space.

          After a moment, he feels something tugging on his wrist. He
          looks down. Pickett, a Bowtruckle, is swinging on a loose
          thread in his cuff.
          The thread snaps. Pickett falls. NEWT'S button rolls away
          down a corridor. NEWT and Pickett watch it go.

          A beat.

          Then both chase after it. NEWT just gets there first. As he
          bends to pick it up, he finds himself confronted by a pair of
          female feet.

                                  LETA (O.S.)
                        They're ready for you, Newt.

                                                                               (CONTINUED)

          He stands up. Face-to-face with LETA LESTRANGE, who is
          beautiful and smiling, NEWT stuffs the button and Pickett
          into his pocket.

                                  NEWT
                        Leta... what are you doing here?

                                  LETA
                        Theseus thought it would be good if
                        I became part of the Ministry
                        family.

                                  NEWT
                        Did he actually say the words
                        "Ministry family"?

          She gives a little laugh. They head off along the corridor.
          Tension. A lot of history.

                                  NEWT (CONT'D)
                        That sounds like my brother.

                                  LETA
                        Theseus was disappointed you
                        couldn't come to dinner. Any of the
                        nights we asked you.

                                  NEWT
                        Well, I've been busy.

                                  LETA
                        He's your brother, Newt, he likes
                        spending time with you. And so do
                        I.

          NEWT spots Pickett climbing onto his lapel and holds out the
          breast pocket of his coat.

                                  NEWT
                             (to Pickett)
                        Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.
          Pickett snuggles down.

                                  LETA
                             (smiling)
                        Why do strange creatures love you
                        so much?

                                  NEWT
                        Well, there are no strange
                        creatures --

          She is smiling again. NEWT reciprocates.

                                  LETA (CONT'D)
                        How long did you get in detention
                        for saying that to Prendergast?

                                   NEWT
                        You know, I think it was a month
                        that time.

                                  LETA
                        And I set off a Dungbomb under his
                        desk so I could join you, do you
                        remember?

          They have come within sight of scary, official doors leading
          to the meeting room.

          THESEUS SCAMANDER emerges.

                                  NEWT
                        No, I actually don't remember that.

          Rebuffed, she comes to a halt.

          NEWT walks away toward THESEUS, who is very like NEWT, but
          more outgoing, easier in manner.

          THESEUS winks at LETA before turning to NEWT.

                                      THESEUS
                        Hello.

                                  LETA
                        Theseus. We were just talking about
                        Newt coming for dinner.

                     THESEUS                                       NEWT
          Really? Well... Look, before                -- It's my fifth attempt,
          we go in there I --                         Theseus. I know the form.
                                  THESEUS (CONT'D)
                        This isn't going to be like the
                        other times. This is... Just try
                        and keep an open mind, will you?
                        And maybe a little less --

          A wordless gesture indicates Pickett, NEWT'S blue coat, and
          his messy hair.


                                                                               (CONTINUED)

                             (not without affection)
                        Well, it can't hurt. Come on, let's
                        go.


19        INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC, HEARING ROOM - AFTERNOON                              19

          NEWT and THESEUS enter the room, where TORQUIL TRAVERS
          (harsh, mean-spirited), ARNOLD GUZMAN (American), and RUDOLPH
          SPIELMAN (who is still bruised from GRINDELWALD'S escape, the
          bloody bite visible on his neck) are already sitting.

          Two empty chairs, which NEWT and THESEUS take.

          The corners of the room are in darkness.

                                  TRAVERS
                        Hearing commences.

          THE QUILL begins to write.

          TRAVERS opens a file in front of him, which contains pictures
          of NEWT'S "Wanted" pictures and of the post-Obscurial
          devastation in New York.

                                  TRAVERS (CONT'D)
                        You want an end to the ban on your
                        traveling internationally. Why?

                                  NEWT
                        Because I like to travel
                        internationally.

                                   SPIELMAN
                             (reading from his own
                             file)
                        "Subject uncooperative and evasive
                        on reasons for last international
                        trip."

          All look at NEWT, waiting.

                                  NEWT
                        It was a field trip. I was
                        collecting material for my book on
                        magical beasts --

                                  TRAVERS
                        You destroyed half of New York.

                                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                   NEWT
                         No, that's actually factually
                         incorrect on two counts --

                                      THESEUS
                                 (quiet but stern)
                         Newt!

           NEWT stops, frowns.

                                   GUZMAN
                         Mr. Scamander, it's clear you're
                         frustrated and, frankly, so are we.
                         In the spirit of compromise, we'd
                         like to make a proposition.

           NEWT glances at THESEUS warily.

           THESEUS nods: Listen.

                                   NEWT
                         What kind of proposition?

                                    TRAVERS
                         The committee will agree to lift
                         your travel ban under one
                         condition.

           NEWT waits.

           SPIELMAN leans forward.

                                   SPIELMAN
                         You join the Ministry.
                         Specifically, your brother's
                         department.

           NEWT digests this, then:

                                   NEWT
                         No, I -- that isn't my kind of --
                         Theseus is the Auror. I think my
                         talents lie elsewhere --

                                   GUZMAN
                         Mr. Scamander. The wizarding and
                         non-wizarding worlds have been at
                         peace for over a century.
                         Grindelwald wants to see that peace
                         destroyed, and for certain members
                         of our community his message is
                         very seductive.

                                   GUZMAN (CONT'D)
                         Many purebloods believe it is their
                         birthright to rule not only our
                         world but the non-magic world as
                         well. They see Grindelwald as their
                         hero, and Grindelwald sees this boy
                         as a means to make this all come
                         true.

           Hearing this, NEWT frowns, watching as CREDENCE'S face
           emerges in the surface of the table.

                                   NEWT
                         I'm sorry. You're talking about
                         Credence as if he were still here.

                                   THESEUS
                         He survived, Newt.

           NEWT stops cold, his eyes fixed on THESEUS.

           THESEUS nods.

                                   THESEUS (CONT'D)
                         He's still alive. He left New York
                         months ago. He's somewhere in
                         Europe. Where exactly, we don't
                         know, but --

                                   NEWT
                         And you want me to hunt Credence
                         down? To kill him?

           Out of the shadows in the corner comes deep, nasty laughter.

                                   GRIMMSON
                         Same old Scamander.

           NEWT reacts to the sound of the voice. GRIMMSON moves into
           the light.

           Scarred, brutal, he is a beast hunter for hire.
                                   NEWT
                              (furious)
                         What's he doing here?

                                   GRIMMSON
                         Taking on the job you're too soft
                         to do.

           GRIMMSON walks toward them while the ghostly image of
           CREDENCE shimmers on the enchanted surface of the table.


                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           NEWT rises furiously, storms toward the door.

                              (calling after him)
                         Travel documentation denied!

           THESEUS stares at the door as it closes.

           The committee looks unsurprised, turns their gazes to the
           smirking GRIMMSON.

           GRINDELWALD and ACOLYTES stand in the street. GRINDELWALD

           A clatter announces the arrival of a horse-drawn hearse.

           GRINDELWALD looks around the street, calm, waiting, tapping
           on the pavement with his cane.

           We see a green flash--the Killing Curse. The door reopens. Two
           black coffins exit.

           GRINDELWALD watches as NAGEL and KRAFFT load the coffins onto
           the carriage.


24         INT. GRINDELWALD'S HIDEOUT, DRAWING ROOM - AFTERNOON                          24

           GRINDELWALD surveys the elegant clutter left by the haute
           bourgeois family he has just murdered.

                                   GRINDELWALD
                         Yes. This will be suitable after a
                         thorough cleanse.
                              (to NAGEL)
                         I want you to go to the circus now.
                         Give my note to Credence, begin his
                         journey.

           NAGEL nods and leaves.

                         in the millions. They've had their
                         time.

                                    GRINDELWALD
                         We don't say such things out loud.
                         We want only freedom. Freedom to be
                         ourselves.

                                   GRINDELWALD
                         Not all of them. Not all. We're not
                         merciless. The beast of burden will
                         always be necessary.

           We hear the sound of a CHILD close at hand.


25         INT. GRINDELWALD'S HIDEOUT, NURSERY - AFTERNOON                               25

           GRINDELWALD enters. A small child looks up, puzzled.

           GRINDELWALD contemplates him for a moment, then nods at
           CARROW and turns to leave.


                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           WE SEE: ANOTHER GREEN FLASH as GRINDELWALD closes the door.


26         EXT. LONDON BACK STREET - EVENING                                             26

           NEWT Apparates and walks on briskly beneath an increasingly
           stormy sky. Seconds later, STEBBINS, an Auror, Apparates some
           yards behind him. They have been playing this game for an
           hour.

           NEWT turns a corner into a darker alleyway, peers back around
           the corner, and points his wand back at STEBBINS.

                                   NEWT
                              (sotto voce)
                         Ventus.

           STEBBINS is immediately caught in a hurricane for one. To the
           confusion and amusement of passing Muggles, his hat flies
           away, he is almost knocked off his feet, and cannot proceed.

           Smiling slightly, NEWT withdraws his head, still leaning
           against the wall of the dark alleyway, to find a single black
           glove hanging in the air in front of him. He looks at it,
           expressionless. It gives a little wave, then points into the
           far distance.

           NEWT looks to where it is pointing. High on the dome of St.
           Paul's Cathedral, a tiny human figure raises its arm.

           NEWT looks back at the glove, which makes as though to shake
           hands.

           NEWT takes it, and he and the glove Disapparate --


27         EXT. DOME OF ST. PAUL'S - EVENING                                             27

           -- Apparating beside a dandyesque forty-five-year-old wizard
           with graying auburn hair and beard.

           NEWT hands back his glove.

                                   NEWT
                         Dumbledore.
                              (amused)
                         Were the less conspicuous rooftops
                         full, then?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                              (looking out over city)
                         I do enjoy a view. Nebulus.


                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           A swirling fog descends over London.

           They Disapparate.


28         EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - EVENING                                               28

           DUMBLEDORE and NEWT Apparate and walk on past the great stone
           Landseer lions. The darkening sky is becoming increasingly
           ominous.

           A flock of pigeons rises into the air at their approach.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         How was it?

                                   NEWT
                         They're still convinced that you
                         sent me to New York.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         You told them I didn't?

                                   NEWT
                         Yes. Even though you did.

           A beat.

           DUMBLEDORE inscrutable, NEWT wanting answers.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                         You told me where to find that
                         trafficked Thunderbird, Dumbledore.
                         You knew that I would take him home
                         and you knew I'd have to take him
                         through a Muggle port.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         Well, I've always felt an affinity
                         with the great magical birds.
                         There's a story in my family that a
                         phoenix will come to any Dumbledore
                         who is in desperate need. They say
                         my great-great- grandfather had
                         one, but that it took flight when
                         he died, never to return.

                                   NEWT
                         With all due respect, I don't
                         believe for a minute that's why you
                         told me about the Thunderbird.



                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           A noise behind them. The silhouette of a man appears out of
           shadows. They Disapparate --


29         EXT. VICTORIA BUS STATION - EVENING                                           29

           Footsteps nearby. Both ready their wands, but the footsteps
           die away. They walk on.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         Credence is in Paris, Newt. He's
                         trying to trace his real family. I
                         take it you've heard the rumors
                         about who he really is?

                                       NEWT
                         No.

           DUMBLEDORE and NEWT board a stationary bus.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         The purebloods think he's the last
                         of an important French line, a baby
                         whom everyone thought lost...

           A look between them. NEWT is astonished.

                                   NEWT
                         Not Leta's brother?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         That's what they're whispering.
                         Pureblood or not, I know this: An
                         Obscurus grows in the absence of
                         love as a dark twin, an only
                         friend. If Credence has a real
                         brother or sister out there who can
                         take its place, he might yet be
                         saved.
                              (beat)
                         Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's
                         either in danger or a danger to
                         others. We may not know who he is
                         yet, but he needs to be found. And
                         I rather hoped you might be the one
                         to find him.

           DUMBLEDORE conjures NICOLAS FLAMEL'S card from thin air and
           offers it to NEWT, who eyes it with suspicion.

                                   NEWT
                         What's that?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         It's an address of a very old
                         acquaintance of mine. A safe house
                         in Paris, reinforced with
                         enchantments.

                                   NEWT
                         Safe house? Why would I need a safe
                         house in Paris?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         One hopes you won't, but should
                         things at some point go terribly
                         wrong, it's good to have a place to
                         go. You know, for a cup of tea.

                                   NEWT
                         No, no, no--absolutely not.

           They Apparate onto a bridge.

                                   NEWT
                         I'm banned from international
                         travel, Dumbledore. If I leave the
                         country, they will put me in
                         Azkaban and throw away the key.

           DUMBLEDORE stops.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         Do you know why I admire you, Newt?
                         More, perhaps, than any man I know?
                              (off NEWT'S surprise)
                         You don't seek power or popularity.
                         You simply ask, is the thing right
                         in itself? If it is, then I must do
                         it, no matter the cost.

           He walks on.

                                   NEWT
                         That's all very well, Dumbledore,
                         but, forgive me for asking, why
                         can't you go?

           They stop.

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                         I can't move against Grindelwald.
                         It has to be you.

                         late. Good evening, Newt.

           DUMBLEDORE Disapparates.

                                       NEWT
                         Oh c'mon!

           DUMBLEDORE'S empty glove reappears and tucks the business
           card bearing the address of the safe house into NEWT'S top
           pocket.

           ESTABLISHING SHOT: A street of ordinary yellow brick
           Victorian houses. First specks of rain.

           NEWT walks swiftly up the front steps but pauses just outside
           the front door. The light in his sitting room is flashing on
           and off.


32         INT. NEWT'S HOUSE  (NIGHT)                                                     32

           NEWT opens the front door cautiously.

           Inside, a baby Niffler is swinging from the brass cord of a
           table lamp, causing the light to flicker on and off.

           The baby Niffler succeeds in stealing the brass cord before
           spotting NEWT. It scampers away, knocking all manner of
           objects to the floor.

           NEWT spots a second baby Niffler sitting on a set of weighing
           scales, pinned down by gold-colored weights it is clearly
           attempting to steal.

           As the first baby makes it to the dining table, NEWT lightly
           drops a saucepan on top of it, which continues moving across
           the table.

           NEWT tosses an apple into the opposite weighing scale,
           sending the baby Niffler flying into the air. NEWT catches
           both baby Nifflers as they fall, then tucks them into his
           pockets.


                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Satisfied, NEWT heads toward the door to his basement but
           turns at the last moment to see a third escaped baby Niffler
           climbing onto a bottle of champagne on the counter.

           With a sense of inevitability, the champagne bottle pops and
           the baby Niffler zooms toward NEWT on top of the cork,
           soaring past him and down the stairs to the basement.


33         INT. NEWT'S BASEMENT MENAGERIE - MOMENTS LATER  (NIGHT)                        33

           A gigantic hospital for magical creatures.

                                   NEWT
                         Bunty! Bunty! Bunty, the baby
                         Nifflers are loose again!
                              (to the Nifflers)
                         Oi! Oh.

           BUNTY, NEWT'S assistant, hurries into view. She is a plain
           girl, crazy about creatures, hopelessly in love with NEWT.
           She peels off the Nifflers with freshly bandaged fingers.

           She tempts the last baby Niffler -- the champagne cork rider -
           - with a gold necklace, then tucks all three into a nest full
           of sparkling objects.

                                       NEWT (CONT'D)
                         Well done.

                                   BUNTY
                         I'm so sorry, Newt, they must have
                         picked the lock while I was
                         cleaning out the Augureys --

                                   NEWT
                         Not to worry.

           NEWT and BUNTY walk together among the enclosures.

                       BUNTY
           Hmm... I've fed nearly                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
           everyone, Pinky's had his                   -- And Elsie?
           nose drops, and --
                                   BUNTY (CONT'D)
                         Elsie's droppings are nearly normal
                         again.

                                   NEWT
                         Wonderful. You can clock off now --
                              (seeing her fingers)

                         I told you to leave the Kelpie to
                         me.

                                   BUNTY
                         That wound needs more ointment--

                                   NEWT
                         I don't want you losing fingers
                         over it.

           NEWT marches toward a patch of black water, BUNTY trotting in
           his wake, awash with emotion at his concern for her.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                         Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.
                         You must be exhausted.
                                   BUNTY
                         You know the Kelpie's easier with
                         two.

           They approach the water.

           NEWT unhooks a bridle hanging beside the pond.

                                   BUNTY (CONT'D)
                              (hopeful)
                         Perhaps you should take off your
                         shirt?

                                   NEWT
                              (oblivious)
                         Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly
                         enough.

           NEWT smiles and jumps backward into the water. The Kelpie
           erupts: a gigantic, semi-spectral horse intent on drowning
           NEWT, who grabs it around the neck and manages to scramble
           onto its back as it thrashes.

           The Kelpie dives, taking NEWT with it. BUNTY waits,
           frightened.

           WHOOSH - NEWT bursts back out of the water and the Kelpie is
           bridled. Now docile, it shakes its mane.

           BUNTY transfixed by the sight of NEWT in his wet shirt.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                         Someone needed to let off some
                         steam. Ointment, Bunty?



                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           She hands it over. Still mounted, NEWT applies ointment to a
           wound on the Kelpie's neck.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                         Bite Bunty again and there'll be
                         trouble, mister.

           As he dismounts, there is a crash from overhead. Both he and
           BUNTY look up.

                                   BUNTY
                              (scared)
                         What was that?

                                   NEWT
                         I don't know. But I want you to go
                         home now, Bunty.

                                   BUNTY
                         Shall I call the Ministry?

                                   NEWT
                         No, I want you to go home. Please.


34         INT. NEWT'S STAIRCASE - A MINUTE LATER  (NIGHT)                                34

           NEWT climbs the stairs to his living quarters, wand drawn,
           curious and expecting the worst.

           He pushes open the door.


35         INT. NEWT'S SITTING ROOM  (NIGHT)                                              35

           A spartan bachelor residence. NEWT'S real life is in the
           basement.

           JACOB KOWALSKI and QUEENIE GOLDSTEIN stand in the middle of
           the room, suitcases beside them, QUEENIE nervous and excited,
           JACOB unfocused and over-merry, possibly drunk. He is holding
           the remaining pieces of NEWT'S vase, which he has just
           broken.

                                   QUEENIE
                         If you could just give it to me...
                         Just give it to me, sweetie. Just
                         give it to me.
                              (whispering)
                         If you could just give this to me,
                         sweetheart. Oh!

                         He doesn't care. Hold it.

                                                       maniac.
           He flings his arms around a delighted but awkward NEWT.

                                   QUEENIE
                         We hope you don't mind, Newt? We
                         let ourselves in -- it's raining
                         out there -- cats and dogs!
                         London's cold!

                         But you were supposed to have been
                         Obliviated!

                                       JACOB
                         I know!

                                   NEWT
                         So... But...

                                   JACOB
                         It didn't work, pal. I mean, you
                         said it, the potion only erases bad
                         memories. I didn't have any. I
                         mean, don't get me wrong, I had
                         some weird ones. But this angel...
                         this angel over here, she filled me
                         in on all the bad parts, and here
                         we are, I guess, huh?

36         INT. NEWT'S SITTING ROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER  (NIGHT)                         36

           The threesome sit at a table bearing NEWT'S mismatched
           crockery, the atmosphere tainted by TINA'S absence.

           QUEENIE'S case lies open on the sofa.

                                   QUEENIE
                         Tina and I aren't talking.

                         Why?

           JACOB'S POV: pink and hazy, as though happily drunk.

                                    QUEENIE
                         Oh well, you know, she found out
                         about Jacob and I seeing each other
                         and she didn't like it, 'cause of
                         the "law."
                              (miming quotation marks)
                         Not allowed to date No-Majs, not
                         allowed to marry them. Blah, blah,
                         blah. Well, she was all in a tizzy
                         anyway, 'cause of you.

                         Yeah, you, Newt. It was in

                         for you --

           She points her wand at her suitcase. A celebrity magazine
           zooms to her:

           "Spellbound: Celebrity Secrets and Spell Tips of the Stars!"

           On the cover, an idealized NEWT and an improbably beaming
           Niffler:

                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           "BEAST TAMER NEWT TO WED!"

           QUEENIE opens the magazine:

           THESEUS, LETA, NEWT, and BUNTY stand side by side at his book
           launch.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                              (showing him)

                         No. Theseus is marrying Leta, not
                         me.
                                   QUEENIE
                         Oh! Oh dear... well, see, Teen read
                         that, and she started dating
                         someone else. He's an Auror. His
                         name's Achilles Tolliver.

           A silence. Then, NEWT starts to notice JACOB'S state:

           Eating sloppily, he hums to himself, then tries to drink the
           salt. QUEENIE takes it and puts his glass in his hand, trying
           to cover.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                         Anyway... We're real excited to be
                         here, Newt. This is a -- well, it's
                         a special trip for us. You see,
                         Jacob and I, we're getting married.

           She shows him her engagement ring. JACOB tries to toast the
           moment and pours beer all over his ear.

                                   JACOB
                         I'm marrying Jacob!
           Now sure he knows what's going on, NEWT glares at QUEENIE.

                                   NEWT (V.O.)
                              (speaking telepathically)
                         You've enchanted him, haven't you?

                                   QUEENIE
                              (reading his mind)
                         What? I have not.




                                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                   NEWT
                         Will you stop reading my mind?
                              (speaking telepathically)
                         Queenie, you've brought him here
                         against his will.

                                   QUEENIE
                         Oh, that is an outrageous
                         accusation. Look at him. He's just
                         happy. He's so happy!

                                   NEWT
                              (drawing his wand)
                         Then you won't mind if I --

           QUEENIE jumps up and tries to shield JACOB from him.

                                   QUEENIE
                         Please don't!

                                   NEWT
                         Queenie, you've got nothing to fear
                         if he wants to get married. We can
                         just lift the enchantment and he
                         can tell us himself.

           Several painful moments pass.

           At last she moves aside.

                                    JACOB
                         What you got there? Whatchu gonna
                         do? Whatchu gonna do with that, Mr.
                         Scamander?

                         Surgito.

           JACOB reacts as though to a bucket of cold water. He comes
           back to himself and takes in his surroundings. He looks at
           NEWT.

                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                         Congratulations on your engagement,
                         Jacob.

                                   JACOB
                         Wait, what?

           NEWT looks at QUEENIE.

                                       JACOB (CONT'D)
                         Oh no.

                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           He realizes he has been taken against his will.

           Slowly, he gets to his feet to face QUEENIE.

           She reads his mind. With a sob, she runs to close her case
           (several small objects, including a lipstick and a fragment
           of torn postcard, fall out) and flees the apartment.

                                   JACOB (CONT'D)
                         Queenie!
                              (turning to NEWT)
                         It's very nice to see you. Where
                         the hell am I right now?

                                   NEWT
                         Uh, uh, London.

                              (frustrated)
                         Oh! I always wanted to go here!
                              (angry)
                         Queenie!

           He runs after her.


37         EXT. NEWT'S STREET - A MINUTE LATER  (NIGHT)                                   37

           QUEENIE dashes out of NEWT'S house and off up the street,
           crying.

           JACOB runs after her, livid.

                                   JACOB
                         Queen, honey. Well, I'm just
                         curious, when were you going to
                         wake me up? After we'd had five
                         kids?

           QUEENIE turns to confront JACOB.
                                   QUEENIE
                         Why is it wrong to want to marry
                         you?

                                       JACOB
                         Okay --

                                   QUEENIE
                         To wanna have a family? I just want
                         what everyone else has, that's all.

                                   JACOB
                         Okay, wait. We talked about this,
                         like, a million times. If we get
                         married and they find out, they're
                         gonna throw you in jail,
                         sweetheart. I can't have that. They
                         don't like people like me marrying
                         people like you. I ain't a wizard.
                         I'm just me.

                                   QUEENIE
                         They're really progressive here,
                         and they'll let us get married
                         properly.

           QUEENIE gestures to the street.

                                   JACOB
                         Sweetheart, you don't need to
                         enchant me. I'm already enchanted!
                         I love you so much.

                                       QUEENIE
                         Yeah?

                                   JACOB
                         Yeah. But I can't have you risking
                         everything like this, you know?
                         You're not giving us a choice,
                         sweetheart.

                                   QUEENIE
                         You're not givin' me a choice. One
                         of us had to be brave, and you were
                         being a coward!

                                   JACOB
                         I was being a coward? If I'm a
                         coward, you're a --

           She reads his mind.

                         -- crazy!

           She reacts. He knows she "heard" him.

                                   JACOB
                         I didn't say it...

           NEWT'S miserable gaze falls on the piece of postcard.

           He crosses to pick it up, then points his wand at it.

           It reconstitutes into a whole.

           We see a picture of Paris. Postcard text becomes visible
           onscreen.

           CLOSE ON: JACOB as he enters, pushes open the door, stares
           around. Soaked through, he has been searching the streets for
           an hour.

                                                                                (CONTINUED)

           NEWT is nowhere to be seen.

                                       JACOB
                         Hey, Newt?

                         Down here, Jacob. I'll be with you
                         in a second.

           JACOB starts peering into the enclosure. By the patch of dark
           water where the Kelpie lives, NEWT has placed a sign for
           BUNTY:

           BUNTY, DON'T TOUCH UNTIL I GET BACK.

           He walks on.

           An Augurey caws mournfully at JACOB as he walks past.

                                   JACOB
                         I got my own problems.

                                   NEWT (O.S.)
                         No, no, no. Back in, please. Right,
                         wait, wait, wait, wait.

           A sign on the Augurey cage reads:

           BUNTY - DON'T FORGET TO GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.

           JACOB hears movement and changes direction, passing a
           snoozing griffin with a bandaged beak:

           BUNTY: CHANGE DRESSING DAILY.

           NEWT'S case sits beside the Niffler enclosure. On the inside
           of the lid is a large moving picture of TINA he has torn out
           of a newspaper.

           NEWT comes round the corner wearing his coat.

                         Queenie left a postcard. Tina's in

                    him.

                    JACOB is blasted with warm magical air, which dries his rain-
                    soaked clothes.

     40             EXT. PARIS, PLACE CACH�E  (NIGHT)                                              40

                    A clear, starry night.

                    TINA GOLDSTEIN, reinstated Auror on a mission of her own,
                    more elegant and confident than in New York but carrying
                    private sadness, walks toward the bronzed statue of a robed
                    woman set on a tall stone base, where witches and wizards
                    dressed as Muggles are vanishing.


     41             EXT. PLACE CACH�E, CIRCUS ARCANUS  (NIGHT)                                     41

                    Music, laughter, and conversation erupt around her.

                    The circus is now in full swing. A banner declares:

                    CIRCUS ARCANUS: FREAKS AND ODDITIES!

                    Several tents, a big top in the middle.

                    TINA walks past the street performers working in the open,
                    scrutinizing them.

                    A HALF-TROLL performs feats of strength.

                    A few misshapen and particularly downtrodden humanoids --
                    UNDERBEINGS without powers but of magical ancestry -- shuffle
                    around, taking money from the crowd.

                    Horns hidden beneath hats, unusual eyes beneath hoods; HALF-
                    ELVES and HALF-GOBLINS juggle and tumble.


                                                                                         (CONTINUED)

                    A magnificent Chinese Zouwu, a giant catlike creature with a
                    long, plumed tail, is imprisoned in a cage. Fireworks burst
                    overhead.


     42             INT. CIRCUS ARCANUS, FREAKS' TENT - EVENING                                     42

                    NAGINI is kneeling at a trunk, stroking her circus dress. She
                    must perform shortly.

                    CREDENCE hurries to her.

                                                   CREDENCE
                                              (whispers)
                                         Nagini!

                    She turns.

                                                     NAGINI
                                         Credence.

                    He hands her the note. She scans it, frowns.

                                                   CREDENCE
                                              (whispers)
                                         I think I know where she is.

                    NAGINI looks up, meets his eyes.

                                                   CREDENCE (CONT'D)
                                         We escape tonight.

                    SKENDER comes into NAGINI'S tent.

                                                   SKENDER
                                         Hey, I've told you to stay away
                                         from her, boy -- did I say you
                                         could take a break? Clean out the
                                         Kappa.

                    SKENDER closes the curtain between CREDENCE and NAGINI.
                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                              (to NAGINI)
                                         And you, get ready!

                    CREDENCE turns and looks up to a cage full of Firedrakes.


     43             INT. CIRCUS ARCANUS, BIG TOP  (NIGHT)                                            43

                    SKENDER is standing beside the circular platform/cage in the
                    middle of a crowd, many of whom are drunk.

                                                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                   SKENDER
                                         Next in our little show of freaks
                                         and oddities, I present to you -- a
                                         Maledictus!

                    He whips open the curtains. There stands NAGINI in a
                    snakeskin dress.

                    Men in the crowd whistle and jeer.

                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                         Once trapped in the jungles of
                                         Indonesia, she is the carrier of a
                                         blood curse. Such Underbeings are
                                         destined, through the course of
                                         their lives, to turn permanently
                                         into beasts.

                    TINA makes her way around the back of the crowd, looking for
                    CREDENCE.

                    Elsewhere in the tent, an elegant, suited French African,
                    YUSUF KAMA, is scanning the crowd rather than watching
                    SKENDER. There is a black feather in the band of his fedora.

                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                         But look at her. So beautiful, yes?
                                         So desirable... but soon she will
                                         be trapped forever in a very
                                         different body. Every night, when
                                         she sleeps... mesdames et
                                         messieurs... she is forced to
                                         become --

                    Nothing happens. The crowd jeers at SKENDER.

                    NAGINI looks at SKENDER, a look of hatred.

                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                         She is forced to become...
                    CREDENCE'S and NAGINI'S eyes meet across the big top.

                    ANGLE ON: TINA, who has spotted CREDENCE. She starts to edge
                    toward him, trying not to attract attention.

                    ANGLE ON: KAMA, who does the same.

                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                         She is forced to become . . .

                    SKENDER whips the bars.


                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    NAGINI closes her eyes. Slowly, she melts into coils.

                                                   SKENDER (CONT'D)
                                         Over time, she will not be able to
                                         transform back. She will be forever
                                         trapped in the body of a snake.

                    NAGINI suddenly strikes at SKENDER through the bars and
                    utters a cry in Parseltongue. SKENDER crumples, bleeding.

                    At the back of the tent, CREDENCE smashes open the
                    Firedrakes' cage and they soar to freedom like fireworks.

                    The big top catches fire -- screams, panic, the crowd falls
                    over one another to reach the exit --

     44             EXT. CIRCUS ARCANUS, BIG TOP  (NIGHT)                                          44

                    The big top is on fire.

                    Firedrakes weave patterns in the sky above it, trailing
                    showers of sparks. The fire has terrified and enraged the
                    creatures. A hippogriff is rearing and plunging while its
                    handlers try to control it.

                    Everywhere performers are packing up, fast, elves shutting
                    themselves into boxes, which fold smaller and smaller.

                    TINA Apparates and, with a flick of her wand, puts out the
                    fire.

                    The Zouwu crate is on fire and shaking perilously. The
                    creature within roars and howls.

                    The Zouwu explodes out of it: a monstrous cat the size of an
                    elephant, five-colored, with a tail as long as a python. It
                    has been horrendously abused: Scars across its face, it is
                    malnourished, limping, and now driven to a frenzy of terror.

                    TINA spots CREDENCE in the distance.
                                                     TINA
                                         Credence!

                    The Zouwu hobbles as fast as it can, away into the darkness.

                    SKENDER knows there is no catching it now. He runs to
                    galvanize his workers.

                                                   SKENDER
                                         Pack it up! Paris is done for us
                                         now.

                    SKENDER points his wand at the tent, shrinks it to the size
                    of a handkerchief, and pockets it.

                                         do you know about him?

                                         He's looking for his mother. All my
                                         freaks think they can go home.
                                         Okay, let's go.

                    He leaps up onto a carriage and, as the crates and boxes are
                    all magically reduced to a few cases, clatters away into the
                    night.

                    TINA is left on her own in what seems for a moment to be a
                    deserted square.

                    Then she realizes that KAMA is standing behind her.

                                                                             CUT TO:

                    TINA and KAMA sit together at an outside table. TINA is
                    suspicious of KAMA.

                                                   TINA
                                         I think we were both at the circus

                                         I am the last male of my pure-
                                         blooded line... and so, if the
                                         rumors are correct, is he.

                    KAMA takes The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus out of his pocket
                    and holds it tantalizingly before her.

                                         something that proves who he is -
                                         would the Ministries of Europe and

                    GRINDELWALD exhales vapor from a glowing skull-shaped hookah.

                    His ACOLYTES watch as the smoke forms a vision of the
                    Obscurus, a swirl of black and flashing red, then resolves
                    into an image of CREDENCE.
                    All look excited, except KRALL, who is sulky.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         So... Credence Barebone. Nearly
                                         destroyed by the woman who raised
                                         him. Yet now he seeks the mother
                                         who bore him. He's desperate for
                                         family. He's desperate for love.
                                         He's the key to our victory.

                                         don't we? Why don't we grab him and
                                         leave!

                                         He must come to me freely -- and he
                                         will.

                    GRINDELWALD returns his gaze to the vision of CREDENCE
                    suspended in the center of the drawing room.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         The path has been laid, and he is
                                         following it. The trail that will
                                         lead him to me, and the strange and
                                         glorious truth of who he is.

                                                   KRALL
                                         Why is he so important?

                    GRINDELWALD walks to face KRALL.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         Who represents the greatest threat
                                         to our cause?

                                                   KRALL
                                         Albus Dumbledore.

                                         If I asked you now to go to the
                                         school where he is hiding and kill
                                         him for me, would you do it for me,
                                         Krall?
                                              (smiles)
                                         Credence is the only entity
                                         alive... who can kill him.

                                                   KRALL
                                         You really think that he can kill
                                         the great -- can kill Albus
                                         Dumbledore?

                                         I know he can. But will you be with
                                         us when that happens, Krall? Will
                                         you?

                    NEWT and JACOB are walking with cases toward Beachy Head.

                    Pickett pokes his head out of NEWT'S breast pocket and yawns.

                                         Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie
                                         said?

                                                   JACOB
                                         Yeah, he's an Auror. So what? Don't
                                         worry about him.

                    A beat.

                    They walk.

                                         her, if I see her?

                                                   JACOB
                                         Oh, well, it's best not to plan
                                         these things. You know, you just
                                         say whatever comes to you in the
                                         moment.

                    A beat.

                    They walk.

                                         salamander.

                                                   JACOB
                                         Don't say that.

                                         her. She'll love that. And then,

                                         Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm
                                         gonna help you find Tina, find

                    He spots a slightly sinister figure on the edge of the cliff:
                    all black, tattered robes.

                    NEWT picks up the bucket and holds out his hand to JACOB.

                    NEWT and JACOB peer around the corner.

                    A French POLICEMAN is standing in front of the statue of the
                    robed woman.

                    JACOB is pale, sweaty, and still clutching the bucket, which
                    has come in handy.

                                                   JACOB
                                         I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.

                                                   NEWT
                                              (absently)
                                         So you keep saying. Follow me.

                    NEWT points his wand at the POLICEMAN.

                                                      NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Confundus.

                    The POLICEMAN lurches as though drunk, blinks, shakes his
                    head, then giggles and ambles off, raising his hat at
                    disconcerted passersby.


                                                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Come on. That'll wear off in a few
                                         minutes.

                    NEWT leads JACOB through the statue and into Magical Paris.
                    He puts his case down and points his wand at the street.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Appare vestigium.

                    The tracking spell materializes as a swirl of gold, which
                    illuminates traces of recent magical activity in the square.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Accio Niffler!
                    The case bursts open and a Niffler jumps out.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Get looking.

                    NEWT climbs onto the case and inspects impressions of
                    creatures revealed in the air, while the now-trained adult
                    Niffler sniffs out clues.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         That's a Kappa. That's a Japanese
                                         water demon --

                    The Niffler sniffs around some shimmering footsteps. The
                    Niffler has found the place where TINA stood in front of the
                    Zouwu.

                    NEWT sees a vision of TINA.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Tina? Tina!
                                              (to Niffler)
                                         What have you found?

                    He bends down to lick the pavement.
                                                   JACOB
                                              (glancing around)
                                         And we're licking the dirt now.

                    NEWT puts his wand to his ear and listens to a terrifying
                    roar. He points his wand to the street.

                                                    NEWT
                                         Revelio.

                    JACOB sees what NEWT is looking at: gigantic paw marks
                    overlaying everything else.

                                                   JACOB
                                              (intensely worried)
                                         Newt... what made those?

                                                   NEWT
                                         That is a Zouwu. It's a Chinese
                                         creature. They are incredibly fast
                                         and incredibly powerful. They can
                                         travel a thousand miles in a day...
                                         and this one could take you from
                                         one part of Paris to the next in a
                                         single leap.

                    The Niffler sniffs around more shimmering footsteps --
                    another place where TINA stood.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Oh, good boy.
                                              (intensely worried)
                                         Jacob, she was here. Tina stood
                                         here. She has incredibly narrow
                                         feet, have you noticed?

                                                   JACOB
                                         Can't say that I have.

                    NEWT sees a vision of KAMA.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Then someone came towards her.

                    NEWT points to a feather from KAMA'S hat, sniffs it, and
                    looks troubled.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Avenseguim.

                    The feather turns like the needle of a compass, pointing the
                    way.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Follow that feather.

                    The Niffler is carried by the spell back into the case.

                    NEWT takes the case and dashes off.

                    JACOB gestures toward the bucket in his hand.

                    QUEENIE approaches the trees in the middle of the square. She
                    coughs. The roots of the trees rise up and form a birdcage

                                         No, it's... I'm sorry there must be
                                         some sort of mistake. See, I know
                                         she's in Paris, she sent me a
                                         postcard. I brought it, I can show
                                         it to you. Maybe you can help me
                                         find her here?

                    QUEENIE reaches for her suitcase, which falls open.

                                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                                         It's just in here. Oh rabbits! If
                                         you can just wait one moment! I
                                         know it's in here somewhere. I
                                         definitely packed it. Where is it?

                    As the RECEPTIONIST gives a Gallic shrug --

                    -- a genteel ELDERLY LADY crosses INTO THE SHOT BEHIND
                    QUEENIE.

                    She has a distinctive bag in her hands --

                    WE FOLLOW her into the elevator --

                    Where ROSIER stands waiting.

                    As the doors close, the ELDERLY LADY transforms into
                    ABERNATHY and he pulls out an elaborate box...

                    QUEENIE stands sadly on the street, holding an umbrella.

                    Then, a double take: did she just see NEWT and JACOB hurrying
                    from one side street into another?

                                                   JACOB
                                         Could we at least stop for a

                                         I don't know.

                                         This way.

                    QUEENIE sets off down the street, trotting in her haste to
                    catch up with NEWT and JACOB.

                    WE FOLLOW her drawing ever closer, as she chooses from a
                    bewildering number of side alleys. So absorbed is she in
                    trying to follow NEWT and JACOB --

                    -- she can now "hear" JACOB'S thoughts.

                                                   QUEENIE
                                              (calls aloud, joyful)
                                         Jacob! Jacob?

                    But he has gone.

                    Exhausted and lonely, QUEENIE drops down to the curb in the
                    rain, deafened by the clamor of the thoughts of those in the
                    crowd around her.

                    A hand falls onto QUEENIE'S shoulder. She turns, beaming. Her
                    expression turns to puzzlement.

                    CREDENCE and NAGINI WALK INTO SHOT, looking around.

                    CREDENCE steals birdseed as he passes a stall.

                    GRIMMSON watches them, unnoticed.

     54             EXT. RUE PHILIPPE LORAND - SHORTLY AFTERWARD - DAY                           54

                    CREDENCE and NAGINI peer around the corner at the distant
                    Number Eighteen.

                    A light shines in the attic. A shadow moves in front of it.

                                                   CREDENCE
                                              (scared)
                                         She's home.

                    Now he is here, he is rooted to the spot. He dare not
                    proceed. NAGINI prizes his hand from behind his back.

                    She leads him across the road.


     55             EXT. REAR OF 18 RUE PHILIPPE LORAND - MINUTES LATER - DAY 55

                    A door stands open into the yard. They slide through it into
                    a servants' passageway.

                    NAGINI'S nostrils flare. Her eyes dart around. There is
                    something wrong.

                    They proceed toward the stairs.


     56             INT. 18 RUE PHILIPPE LORAND, LANDING OUTSIDE MAID'S ROOM - 56
                    DAY

                    CREDENCE and NAGINI reach the landing. A door stands ajar.

                    A shadow cast by lamplight: what seems to be a woman, sewing.
                    The shadow pauses in its work.

                    NAGINI is edgy, nervous, looking around.

                                                   IRMA (O.S.)
                                              (in French)
                                         Qui est l�?

                    CREDENCE can neither move nor speak. NAGINI realizes this.

                                                   NAGINI
                                              (in French)
                                         C'est votre fils, madame.

                    She takes CREDENCE'S hand and pulls him gently into the room.

                    Mended and freshly washed clothing hang from racks on the
                    ceiling. They can see the shadow of a woman.


                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    NAGINI'S senses are hyperalert. She can smell danger. The
                    shadow stands.

                                                   IRMA
                                              (in French)
                                         Qui �tes-vous?

                                                   CREDENCE
                                              (whispers, terrified)
                                         Are you Irma? Are you... ? Are you
                                         Irma Dugard?

                    No response.

                    They move through the hanging fabric toward her.

                                                   CREDENCE (CONT'D)
                                         I'm sorry. Your name is on my
                                         adoption paper. Does this make
                                         sense? You gave me to Mrs. Barebone
                                         in New York.

                    A beat.

                    A tiny hand pushes the last piece of fabric aside.

                    There stands IRMA: half-elf, half-human.

                    CREDENCE'S face reveals confusion, awful disappointment.

                                                   IRMA
                                              (to CREDENCE)
                                         I am not your mother. I was only a
                                         servant.
                                              (smiling)
                                         You were such a beautiful baby. And
                                         you are a beautiful man. I have
                                         missed you.

                    ANGLE ON: GRIMMSON watching them from a doorway.
                                                   CREDENCE
                                         Why didn't they want me? But why is
                                         your name on my adoption paper?

                                                   IRMA
                                         I took you to Mrs. Barebone because
                                         she was supposed to look after you.

                    NAGINI'S fear is increasing.

                    ANGLE ON: THE DARK WALL BEHIND SWATHES OF FABRIC.


                                                                                         (CONTINUED)

                    The perfectly camouflaged GRIMMSON emerges from the wall,
                    raises his wand, aims for the silhouetted figures, and
                    dispatches a Killing Curse that sears through the sheets and
                    clothing, leaving smoldering holes.

                    We hear a body fall. NAGINI screams.

                    CREDENCE'S shadow has vanished.

                    Grinning, certain of triumph, GRIMMSON slashes away the
                    smoking fabric until he stands facing --

                    IRMA, dead on the floor, and NAGINI, who backs away from him.
                    Slowly, his grin fading, GRIMMSON looks up at the ceiling.
                    The Obscurus is swirling there like thick black smoke.

                    In a flash, GRIMMSON conjures a domed Shield Charm around
                    himself and IRMA'S body.

                    And the Obscurus dives, pelting the Shield Charm like a
                    million bullets, rising and re-forming and diving again, but
                    though the magical barrier trembles, it is not broken.

                    Now the Obscurus expands in fury, smashing apart the attic
                    like a tornado.

                    GRIMMSON smiles up at the Obscurus: We'll meet again.

                    He Disapparates. Mingling with the debris of the destroyed
                    attic, the Obscurus slams inward and CREDENCE re-forms.

                    He stands looking down at the tiny body.


     57             EXT. ALLEYWAY - AFTERNOON                                                    57

                    Fresh from IRMA'S murder, GRIMMSON stands in a covered
                    alleyway beneath a bridge over the Seine.

                    GRINDELWALD appears.

                                                   GRIMMSON
                                         She's dead.

                    GRINDELWALD walks toward him and halts when they are face-to-
                    face.

                                                   GRINDELWALD

                    A pair of lovers sit over coffee.

                    NEWT is scanning every man who leaves the caf�, checking the
                    reaction of the feather trapped beneath the glass.

                    JACOB stares at the lovers.

                                                    JACOB
                                         You know what I miss about Queenie?
                                         Everything. I even miss the stuff
                                         that drove me nuts. Like the mind
                                         reading...
                                              (he notices NEWT'S
                                              inattention)
                                         ...I was lucky to have someone like
                                         her even interested in anything I
                                         thought. You know what I mean?

                    A beat.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Sorry?

                                                   JACOB
                                         I was saying, you're sure the guy
                                         is here that we're looking for?

                                                   NEWT
                                         Definitely. The feather says so.


     59             INT. PARISIAN CAF�, BATHROOM - EVENING                                       59

                    A cramped and dirty bathroom.

                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    KAMA stares into the           mirror, his featherless fedora perched
                    on the tap. Suddenly           his face twitches. He raises his
                    bandaged hand to his           eye and rubs it, shaking his head. He
                    removes his hand and           stares at his reflection.

                    WE CLOSE IN: A tiny tentacle is visible at the corner of his
                    eye. He whimpers in distress and gropes in his suit pocket
                    for a small bottle of bright green liquid, which he drops
                    into his eye with a dropper.

                    Another whimper of pain as the tentacle withdraws. He looks
                    at his reflection. It seems normal. He puts his hat back on
                    and leaves.

                    KAMA leaves the caf�.

                    The feather points at him. NEWT lets it out and it flies to
                    KAMA'S hat.

                                                   JACOB
                                         Is that the guy we're looking for?

                                                   NEWT
                                         Yes.

                    NEWT and JACOB jump up to confront him.

                    KAMA makes to carry on walking, ignoring NEWT.

                    The interior of KAMA'S hideout is pitch black. The sound of
                    WATER DRIPPING.

                    A brief shaft of sunlight reveals TINA, sleeping lightly on
                    the floor in her coat.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Tina?

                    She wakes.

                    A MOMENT as NEWT and TINA stare at each other. Each has
                    thought of the other daily for a year.

                    With no sign of KAMA, it seems she has been rescued.

                    TINA notices KAMA entering in the background and raising his
                    wand. Her expression changes.

                    NEWT'S wand flies out of his hand into KAMA'S.

                    Bars form across the door, imprisoning them.

                                         Well, that's not the best start to
                                         a rescue attempt.

                                         This was a rescue attempt? You've

                    JACOB launches for the door, trying to break it down.

                    TINA throws him a dark look. She strides to the back of the
                    cave.

                    Pickett, who, unnoticed, has hopped out of NEWT'S pocket,
                    successfully picks the lock, and the bars swing open.

                                         Yeah. I think this man knows where
                                         Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

                    As they bend over the unconscious KAMA, they hear an earth-
                    shattering roar from somewhere above them. They look at each
                    other.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Well, that'll be the Zouwu.

                    NEWT grabs his wand and Disapparates.


     62             EXT. PARISIAN BRIDGE  (NIGHT)                                                 62

                    In the middle of the bridge is the Zouwu, terrified and
                    lethal. It is too badly hurt to keep running, but it is
                    swiping at PASSERSBY, who are screaming and running out of
                    the way.

                    Cars screech to a halt.

                    NEWT Apparates in the middle of the bridge, fifty yards from
                    the Zouwu, holding his case.

                    A second later, TINA Apparates too, holding JACOB'S arm.

                    JACOB is sagging under the weight of the unconscious KAMA.

                                                   JACOB
                                              (calls)
                                         Newt, get out of there!

                    NEWT stoops down slowly and opens his case. The Zouwu snarls,
                    crouches, and begins to advance on NEWT.

                    Very slowly, so as not to alarm the Zouwu, NEWT lowers his
                    arm into the case, feeling for something. It takes him longer
                    than he expected. Frowning, he reaches deeper inside. The
                    Zouwu advances. It bares its teeth.

                    NEWT has found what he was looking for. He raises his arm. He
                    is holding a fluffy toy bird on a stick and rope.


                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    A beat.

                    The Zouwu's eyes start to follow the bird.

                    The Zouwu's tail twitches. It crouches lower than ever. Then,
                    with a sudden bound, it soars through the air toward NEWT.
                    Screams from the onlookers -- NEWT will surely be crushed --

                    But at the last moment he lets the bird fall into the case
                    and the Zouwu sails after it in a flash of rainbow color,
                    python tail flailing and -- WHAM -- NEWT slams the lid shut.

                    Uproar from the crowd, sirens approaching, police cars
                    converging on the bridge.

                    FLAMEL'S card flies up out of NEWT'S pocket.

                    TINA and JACOB, still carrying KAMA, run toward NEWT, and all
                    four Disapparate.

                    An ominous procession of AURORS marches up the drive toward
                    the castle, among them, THESEUS and LETA.

                    CLOSE ON: AN UPPER WINDOW. STUDENTS staring down at the
                    strangers, nudging one another.

                    The AURORS enter the school.


     64             INT. DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS CLASSROOM - DAY                             64

                    DUMBLEDORE is teaching. A space in the middle of the room,
                    all students enjoying the spectacle.

                    A large boy - MCCLAGGAN - is braced for attack, his robes
                    covered in dust, his tie knotted around his ear. He and
                    DUMBLEDORE circle each other.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE

                                         Caught by surprise, sir.

                                         most important one?

                    MCCLAGGAN looks away, thinking. DUMBLEDORE hits him unawares.
                    MCCLAGGAN flies into the air, DUMBLEDORE conjures a sofa,
                    MCCLAGGAN hits it and slides to the floor.

                    The class laughs.
                    The door opens. TRAVERS, THESEUS, and four other AURORS
                    enter, YOUNG MINERVA MCGONAGALL behind them.

                                         is his equal. I need you to fight
                                         him.

                    A pause. The AURORS watch.

                                                     DUMBLEDORE
                                         I cannot.

                                         Because of this?

                    He casts a spell to show moving pictures of TEENAGE
                    DUMBLEDORE and TEENAGE GRINDELWALD. The AURORS are shocked.

                    The TEENAGE DUMBLEDORE and TEENAGE GRINDELWALD stare intently
                    into each other's eyes.

                                                   TRAVERS (CONT'D)
                                         You and Grindelwald were as close
                                         as brothers.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         We were closer than brothers.

                    DUMBLEDORE is looking at the pictures. These memories are
                    agony. He is full of remorse but, almost worse: nostalgia for
                    the only time in his life he felt fully understood.

                    MORNING

                    13-YEAR-OLD LETA stands hiding inside the empty classroom
                    while students in cloaks trundle by, pushing trunks and
                    carrying owls. It is the last day of the winter term and
                    nearly everyone is going home.

                    ANGLE ON: TWO 13-YEAR-OLD GRYFFINDOR GIRLS pushing trunks.

                                                   GRYFFINDOR GIRL 1
                                         You know she stays here every
                                         vacation. Her family don't actually
                                         want her home.

                                                   GRYFFINDOR GIRL 2
                                         I don't blame them, she's so
                                         annoying. Even the name Lestrange
                                         makes me feel sick --

                    LETA flings herself into their path, pointing her wand.

                                                    13-YEAR-OLD LETA

                    GRYFFINDOR GIRL 2'S mouth is sealed shut as though she never
                    had one.

                    Triumphant, LETA flees the scene, pushing past shocked
                    students.

                    McGONAGALL silences the girl.

                    ANGLE ON: LETA, sprinting around a corner.

                    She wrenches open a side door and plunges inside.

                    13-YEAR-OLD LETA slams the door and stands there, ear against
                    it. She hears running, distant shouts.

                    Then a sound behind her makes her jump and turn around.

                    13-YEAR-OLD NEWT is already in occupation of the cupboard. He
                    has hidden a couple of tanks here, one containing tadpoles,
                    another Streelers.

                    A lined cardboard box serves as a nest for the raven chick he
                    is cradling in his hand. It wears a splint on its broken leg.
                    NEWT and LETA stare at each other.

                                         I'm not going home.

                    LETA takes in the tanks, then the ugly little bird, to which
                    NEWT now feeds an earthworm.

                                         A raven chick.

                    She is mildly intrigued now.

                    She watches him stroking the bird's head. As he places the
                    chick gently in her hands, she seems to see him plainly for
                    the first time.

                    It is Boggart time.

                    DUMBLEDORE supervises the line of teenagers advancing to try
                    their luck.

                    "Riddikulus" -- "Riddikulus" -- gusts of hilarity as a shark
                    becomes a flotation device, a zombie's head turns into a
                    pumpkin, a vampire turns into a buck-toothed rabbit.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         All right, Newt. Be brave.

                    16-YEAR-OLD NEWT moves to the front of the queue. The Boggart
                    turns into a Ministry desk.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)
                                         Mmm, that's an unusual one. So Mr.
                                         Scamander fears what more than
                                         anything else in the world?

                                                   16-YEAR-OLD NEWT
                                         Having to work in an office, sir.

                    The class roars with laughter.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         Go ahead, Newt.

                    NEWT turns the desk into a gamboling wooden dragon and moves
                    aside.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         Well done. Good job.

                    It is 16-YEAR-OLD LETA'S turn, but she doesn't move. She is
                    terrified.




                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                         Leta, it's only a Boggart, it can't
                                         hurt you. Everyone's scared of
                                         something.

                    A group of girls stands together, enjoying her fear.

                                                   GRYFFINDOR GIRL 1
                                         I've been looking forward to this.

                    LETA steps forward. The Boggart transforms and at once, all
                    laughter is extinguished.

                    Green light is reflected on every horrified face.
                    We see a shadow, with a tiny human hand. LETA lets out a sob
                    and runs from the room.

                    PREVIOUSLY - EVENING

                    NEWT finds LETA sitting by the lake, tearstained, eyes
                    swollen. They look at each other.

                                                   16-YEAR-OLD LETA
                                         I don't want to talk about it!

                    He holds out his hand and she lets him pull her up.

                    He leads her past a few trees until they reach the one where
                    Bowtruckles are climbing and fighting and playing. They
                    freeze at the humans' approach but relax when they recognize
                    NEWT. He holds out a finger. One of them jumps on.

                                                   16-YEAR-OLD NEWT
                                         They know me, or they'd hide. They
                                         only nest in trees with wand --
                                         quality wood, did you know that?

                                         And they have very complex social
                                         lives. If you watch them for long
                                         enough, you realize...

                    He trails off.

                    She is watching him, not the Bowtruckles. NEWT reaches across
                    to her, the Bowtruckle standing on his wrist. His hand grazes
                    hers.

                    LETA is still sitting at her old desk in the present-day
                    classroom.

                    DUMBLEDORE enters.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         This is a surprise.

                                                   LETA
                                              (cold)
                                         Finding me in a classroom? Was I
                                         such a bad student?

                                                    DUMBLEDORE
                                         On the contrary, you were one of my
                                         cleverest.

                                                   LETA
                                         I said bad, not stupid. Don't
                                         bother answering. I know you never
                                         liked me.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         Well, you're wrong. I never thought
                                         you bad.

                                                   LETA
                                         You were alone, then. Everybody
                                         else did.
                                              (very quietly)
                                         And they were right. I was wicked.

                    A beat as he considers her.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         Leta, I know how painful the rumors
                                         about your brother Corvus must be
                                         for you.

                                                   LETA
                                         No, you don't. Not unless you had a
                                         brother who died too.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         In my case, it was my sister.

                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    She stares at him, both hostile and curious.

                                         Not as well as I should have done.

                    He steps toward LETA.

                    QUEENIE is on the sofa, beside a table of tea and cakes.

                    She sets down her empty teacup. We feel her slight
                    awkwardness as it is instantly refilled by ROSIER.

                                                   QUEENIE
                                         Oh, no, thank you. You've been real
                                         kind, but my sister Tina's probably
                                         worried sick about me, you know.
                                         Banging on all the doors and
                                         things, so I think I'd better be
                                         going.

                                                   ROSIER
                                         But you haven't met your host.
                                                   QUEENIE
                                              (a little wistfully)
                                         Oh, are you married?

                                                   ROSIER
                                              (smiling)

                                         French.

                    ROSIER laughs and leaves. QUEENIE is confused.

                    An enchanted teapot hovering in midair nudges her, intent on
                    refilling her cup.

                                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                                              (to the teapot)
                                         Hey, knock it off.

                    The door opens. GRINDELWALD enters.
                    QUEENIE stands and the teapot and cups smash to the ground.

                    She draws her wand and aims it at GRINDELWALD.

                                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                                         You stay right there. I know what
                                         you are.

                    He walks slowly toward her.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         Queenie, we are not here to hurt
                                         you. We only want to help you.
                                         You're so very, very far from home.
                                         Far away from everything you love.
                                         Everything that was comfortable.

                    QUEENIE stares, keeping her wand raised.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         I would never see you harmed, ever.
                                         It is not your fault that your
                                         sister is an Auror. I wish you were
                                         working with me now towards a world
                                         where we wizards are free to live
                                         openly, and to love freely.

                    GRINDELWALD'S hand touches her wand-tip and lowers it.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         You are an innocent. So go now.
                                         Leave this place.

                    A spartan room.

                    A large object stands against the wall, covered in black
                    velvet.

                    DUMBLEDORE stands thinking for a moment, then approaches the
                    covered object and pulls the curtain down.

                    The Mirror of Erised is revealed. He has not looked into it
                    for many years. Bracing himself, he now does so:

                    WE SEE: TEENAGE DUMBLEDORE and TEENAGE GRINDELWALD facing
                    each other in a barn. Both score their palms with their
                    wands. Now bleeding, they interlace their hands...

                    DUMBLEDORE turns his head away, fighting the impulse to cover
                    the glass again.

                    Bracing himself, he looks up.

                    From their bloody palms rise two glowing drops of blood,
                    which mingle and merge to create one. A metal shape begins to
                    form around the droplet, becoming more defined and intricate.
                    It is GRINDELWALD'S vial.

                    THE VISION FADES --

                    -- and the present-day GRINDELWALD stands smiling out of the
                    mirror, surrounded by blackness.

                    A creepy medieval drawing room. The tapestries sport moving
                    figures and odd runes. A large crystal ball in a corner shows
                    dark clouds.

                    TINA is trying to wake up KAMA with a bottle of smelling
                    salts. He moves slightly.

                    The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus slips out of his pocket onto
                    the floor. TINA picks it up and opens it to the prediction
                    KAMA has underlined.

                    NEWT'S case is open on a table. The Zouwu roars from inside.
                    TINA turns to look at it, listening.

                    A wild Chinese habitat.

                    NEWT is curled up in dense undergrowth. The Zouwu picks him
                    up and dangles him from a claw.

                    JACOB enters and sees TINA watching the case. She hastily
                    looks back at the book.

                                                   JACOB
                                              (calling into case)
                                         Hey, Newt, buddy. Tina's up here.
                                         She's all by her lonesome and maybe
                                         you want to come up and keep her

                                         I've been looking for food, and I
                                         ain't found any. I guess I'm gonna
                                         go upstairs and try my luck in the -

                    Still dangling from the Zouwu's claw, NEWT soothes and coaxes
                    her until he can reach her harness and remove it. The Zouwu
                    is finally freed from her chains.

                                                   NEWT
                                         You're all right.

                    JACOB is about to leave when NEWT clambers back out of the
                    case.

                                                   NEWT
                                         She's responded well to the
                                         Dittany. She was born to run, you
                                         see. I think she's just lacking in
                                         confidence --

                    He glances at TINA. She pockets The Predictions of Tycho
                    Dodonus and speaks, not quite looking at NEWT.

                                         help revive this man? I need to
                                         question him. I think he knows who
                                         Credence really is. The scars on
                                         his hand suggest an unbreakable vow
                                         --

                                         that too --

                    They examine the unconscious KAMA.

                    NEWT'S and TINA'S hands brush as NEWT advances his lit wand-
                    tip to look in KAMA'S eye. Both jump.

                    NEWT stares into KAMA'S eye. The tiny flicker of a tentacle,
                    swiftly withdrawn --

                    He has extracted something like a spindly, waterborne spider,

                    MUGGLES pass, totally immune, but a YOUNG RED-HAIRED WITCH
                    nearby is walking along. She, like NEWT and TINA, can see the
                    banners.

                    TINA steps into the middle of the road, watching the black
                    silk fall out of the sky to shroud the surrounding buildings
                    in darkness.

                    GRINDELWALD takes a piece of parchment from his pocket and
                    throws it into the air.

                    The parchment flutters to CREDENCE and lands gently in his
                    hand.

                    An uncomfortable JACOB is asleep in a chair beside the
                    semiconscious KAMA.

                    KAMA is muttering:

                    JACOB'S grip is firm -- too firm for the alchemist's fragile
                    bones.

                                                   FLAMEL
                                         Aha! At last, we see developments!

                                                   JACOB
                                              (drawing closer)
                                         I've seen one of these before. It
                                         was at the fair. There was this
                                         dame there, and she had a veil. I
                                         gave her a nickel and she told me
                                         about my future.
                                              (beat)
                                         She missed out on quite a bit,
                                         actually.

                    WE CLOSE IN ON: the orb, into dark billowing smoke and
                    flashes of lightning, into the center where we see CREDENCE --

                                                   JACOB (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                                         Hey -- wait a minute! I know him.
                                         That's that kid. That's Credence --

                    -- and then it becomes the Lestrange tomb, its stone raven
                    prominent.

                    Suddenly, QUEENIE appears inside the tomb, sitting on a stone
                    bench, waiting...

                                                    JACOB (CONT'D)
                                         Hey! That's Queenie! There she is.
                                               (as if to QUEENIE)
                                         Hi, baby!
                                               (to FLAMEL)
                                         Where is this? Is this -- is this
                                         here?

                                                   FLAMEL
                                         This is the Lestrange tomb. It lies
                                         in the cemetery of P�re Lachaise...

                                              (to QUEENIE in the
                                              crystal ball)
                                         I'm coming, baby. Stay right there -
                                         -
                                              (to FLAMEL)
                                         Thank you, thank you, Mr. Flamel!

                    JACOB clutches FLAMEL'S hands in gratitude.

                                         Ouch.

                                                    JACOB
                                         Oh--look after Mr. Tentacles for me.

                    He turns. The sofa is empty.

                    JACOB runs out of the room into the hall. The front door
                    stands open.

                    KAMA has escaped.

                                                   JACOB (CONT'D)
                                         Oh no. I'm sorry, I gotta go.

                                                   FLAMEL
                                         Please, you must not go to the
                                         cemetery!

                    But JACOB too runs off into the night.

                    BACK TO FLAMEL: he has shuffled after JACOB, but on realizing
                    he is gone, FLAMEL turns anxiously back to the orb. Black
                    flames are swirling around it.

                    FLAMEL shuffles back into his studio and opens a cupboard. We
                    glimpse glass vials, tubes, and the glowing Philosopher's
                    Stone. He heaves from a shelf a padlocked book embossed with
                    a phoenix. He touches the padlock and it springs open.

                    CLOSE ON THE BOOK: as he flicks through it.

                    Each page holds a photograph captioned with a name. FLAMEL
                    turns the pages, but the subjects of all the pictures are
                    missing.

                                                      FLAMEL (CONT'D)
                                         Oh dear --

                    DUMBLEDORE'S portrait is blank.

                    FLAMEL flicks open another page:

                    EULALIE HICKS, a young American professor at Ilvermorny,
                    looks around, worried.

                                         Grindelwald rallies tonight at the

                    TINA and NEWT stand in a nearby alleyway, looking out over
                    the square where tree roots previously rose to form the
                    birdcage elevator to the French Ministry.

                                         The box is in the ancestral records
                                         room, Tina. So, three floors down.

                    NEWT rummages in his pockets and pulls out a tiny bottle with
                    only a couple of muddy drops left inside it.

                                                   TINA
                                         Is that Polyjuice?

                                         Just enough to get me inside.

                    He looks down at his coat and finds one of THESEUS'S hairs on
                    his shoulder.

                    He adds it to the mixture, drinks, and turns into THESEUS,
                    still wearing NEWT'S clothes.

                                         My brother, Theseus. He's an Auror.
                                         And a hugger.

                                         tonight.

                                         I know, I know. And the records,
                                         the records will prove that, okay?
                                         They can't lie.

                    angry TRAVERS (who hasn't spotted NEWT) behind.

                    LETA backs away from the throng and slips through a side
                    door.

                    NEWT-AS-THESEUS and TINA run along a corridor lined with
                    pictures, the Polyjuice Potion already wearing off NEWT.

                    The Potion wears off completely.

                    At once, every portrait along the corridor turns into NEWT.
                    An alarm sounds.

                    -- into a mailroom.

                    Two elderly PORTERS are pushing mailcarts across the circular
                    room.

                    As they sprint past the mailcarts, THESEUS sends a curse
                    after them, sending the mailcart boxes flying.

                    TINA blocks the spell.

                                                   TINA
                                         He needs to control his temper!

                    TINA points her wand. THESEUS is slammed down into a high
                    chair that TINA has conjured out of nowhere.

                    Hands bound, THESEUS flies backward on the chair into a
                    meeting room, where he slams into a wall.

                    An ancient tomb containing many sarcophagi is dominated by
                    the grand marble tomb of LETA'S father.

                    ABERNATHY and MACDUFF enter carrying the bag retrieved from
                    the French Ministry and remove the elaborate box, which they

                    JACOB is panting as he runs through the dark, deserted
                    cemetery, looking for the tomb he saw in the orb.

                    A faint light in the distance shows him the Lestrange
                    mausoleum.

                    JACOB reaches the tomb. A stone raven on the lintel.

                    A silhouetted figure lunges at him.

                    NEWT and TINA turn a corner into a beautiful atrium area in
                    front of towering Art Nouveau doors carved to resemble trees.

                    A very old woman behind a desk bars the way: MELUSINE.

                    An increased awkwardness between them as MELUSINE lifts an
                    ancient book onto the desk and opens it.

                    The doors close behind them, plunging them into darkness.

                    all carved to look like trees, so that they seem to be on the
                    edge of the forest.

                                         It was a mistake in a stupid
                                         magazine. My brother's marrying
                                         Leta, June the sixth. I'm supposed
                                         to be best man. Which is sort of
                                         mildly hilarious.

                    Pickett is climbing out of NEWT'S pocket onto the nearest
                    shelf. NEWT doesn't notice.

                    NEWT pulls the picture of her from his breast pocket and
                    unfolds it. She is inordinately touched.

                    He looks from the picture to TINA.

                                         I got this -- I mean, it's just a

                    jump apart.

                    Somebody has entered the room. They draw back among the
                    shelves.

                    She walks inside, desperate. This is her last chance to hide
                    evidence about Corvus's death. The doors close behind her.
                    She raises her wand.

                    ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA. The giant trees are shifting all
                    around them. They are almost crushed as the Lestrange "tree"
                    flies toward them. They hop onto a shelf.

                    ANGLE ON: LETA. The towering stack stops, swaying, in front
                    of her. She stares. An empty shelf confronts her. A mark in
                    the dust where a box sat, a slip of parchment in its place.

                    She picks up the slip and reads it aloud.

                    AT THAT MOMENT: MELUSINE enters the records room surrounded
                    by growling Matagots.

                                         They guard the Ministry -- but they
                                         won't hurt you unless you --

                    Panicking, LETA fires a spell at one of the cats.

                    Her spell not only fails, it causes the Matagots to multiply
                    and become even more aggressive.

                    As each batch of Matagots is hit, they multiply and mutate.

                    LETA climbs over the balustrade to join NEWT and TINA on the
                    shelf stack.

                    The towering stack flies backward as the Matagots pounce in a
                    terrifying ebony surge of teeth and claws.

                    The other "trees" of the records room forest spin and move as
                    NEWT, TINA, and LETA run through the room chased by the
                    attacking Matagots.

                    But just as the Matagots seemingly lose the trail, all of the
                    records room towers retract into the floor, leaving the room
                    empty. The Matagots prowl toward where their prey must surely
                    be standing, only to find --

                    NEWT'S case.

                    An explosion as the Zouwu bursts out of the case, NEWT
                    clinging to its back.

                    Roaring, it rears, slashing at the rising tide of Matagots,
                    its mane flashing.

                                                      NEWT

                    NEWT'S case flies into his hand.

                    For a few seconds the Zouwu and NEWT vanish under the
                    seething mass of cats. They fight them off, the Zouwu's
                    immense power unmatched, red tail swishing.

                    balcony.

                    LATER  (NIGHT)
                    The Matagots give chase as the Zouwu gallops out of the room,
                    leaving injured and thwarted Matagots in its wake.

                    The Zouwu carves a path of destruction through the Ministry.
                    It takes one last leap over the typing pool...

                    ... and its immense magical power propels it up and out
                    through the glass roof.


     98             EXT. P�RE LACHAISE CEMETERY  (NIGHT)                                           98

                    NEWT and the Zouwu land in the cemetery. With one gigantic
                    leap, the Zouwu has taken them to freedom.

                    The few Matagots that have followed them growl and then
                    shrink. Reduced to the size of domestic cats in the Muggle
                    environment, they "meow" pitifully.

                    NEWT opens his case as the Zouwu nudges him with affection.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, wait. Hold
                                         it there, please. Come on. All
                                         right, okay, wait. Okay.
                    LETA and TINA climb out of the case to observe NEWT coaxing
                    the Zouwu.

                    TINA shakes the cat bird toy she has retrieved from the case.
                    The Zouwu's eyes light up.

                    Unnoticed by NEWT and TINA, LETA runs away into the darkness.

                    LETA enters the ornate space lined with sleeping statues of
                    dead Lestranges.

                    JACOB stands backed against the wall next to NAGINI in snake
                    form, who is repeatedly lashing out at KAMA, who is trying to
                    get a clean shot at CREDENCE.

                                                   KAMA
                                              (to NAGINI)
                                         Move back! Move! Out of the way! If
                                         I must kill you as well as Corvus,
                                         I shall!

                    LETA raises her wand at KAMA, who swings round to see her,
                    wand pointed at him -- a standoff.

                                                   LETA
                                         Stop!

                    She walks forward, stricken but determined, at last, to do
                    the right thing.

                    KAMA is mesmerized. She is his mother reborn.

                    He moves toward LETA, studies her face in the darkness,
                    transfixed and moved by the sight of her.

                    NEWT and TINA enter and exchange looks: another piece of the
                    puzzle.

                                                   CREDENCE

                                         I don't know.

                    He pushes past LETA and faces KAMA, unprotected.

                                                   CREDENCE

                    We see a beautiful woman, LAURENA, dressed in an exquisite
                    gown, walking through a park with her husband, MUSTAFA --
                    clearly in love.

                    A YOUNG YUSUF by their side.

                                         My mother, Laurena, was equally
                                         high-bred--a noted beauty. They were
                                         deeply in love. They knew a man of
                                         great influence, from a famous
                                         French pureblood family. He desired
                                         her.

                    Watching from a distance, an intense wizard, CORVUS LESTRANGE
                    SR, studies her beauty.

                    LAURENA'S gown changes to a nightdress.

                    She is walking slowly downstairs, a supernatural wind
                    blowing.

                                         Lestrange used the Imperius Curse
                                         to seduce and abduct her...

                    The twelve-year-old KAMA runs after his mother, tugs at her
                    hand, and tries to pull her back upstairs.

                    She throws him off. The front door flies open.

                    LESTRANGE SR stands at the foot of the garden path. LAURENA
                    walks toward him. KAMA chases after her.

                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    LESTRANGE SR points his wand at KAMA and sends him sprawling.

                    LAURENA lies on the bed as IRMA carries a newborn swaddled in
                    a blanket to LESTRANGE SR.

                                         His servant, Irma Dugard, was a
                                         half-elf. Her magic was weak and
                                         therefore left no trace I could
                                         follow. I had only just discovered
                                         how you had escaped when I received
                                         news I never expected...

                    IRMA lifts a baby from a crib and departs, watched by a
                    desolate LESTRANGE SR.

                                         My father sent me to America, along

                    IRMA is asleep, CHILD LETA awake on a lower bunk, and BABY
                    CORVUS screaming in his crib.

                                                   LETA (V.O.)
                                         Irma was to pose as a grandmother
                                         with two grandchildren...

                    The lights suddenly flicker on and off -- CHILD LETA hasn't
                    moved, she is still looking at the screaming BABY CORVUS.

                                                   LETA (V.O.)
                                         Corvus never stopped crying.

                    In the background there is a commotion as figures run along
                    the corridor outside the door.

                    As CHILD LETA approaches BABY CORVUS, who continues to cry,
                    IRMA wakes.

                    She goes to investigate the fuss and noise in the corridor.

                                                   LETA (V.O.)
                                         I never wanted to hurt him.

                    CHILD LETA is transfixed by the baby.

                                         I only wanted to be free of him.

                    The door of the opposite cabin is ajar.

                    BABY CREDENCE is inside, fast asleep.

                    CHILD LETA slips inside. She swaps the babies.

                    CHILD LETA enters with BABY CREDENCE.

                                         Give him to me!

                    The ship lurches again. IRMA snatches BABY CREDENCE, not
                    noticing the switch amid the confusion.

                    The cabin door bangs open to reveal a dark-haired young woman
                    wearing a nightdress and life jacket.

                                                   CREDENCE'S AUNT
                                         Irma? They want us to put on life
                                         jackets!

                    She slips and slides into her own cabin and picks up BABY
                    CORVUS, also not realizing the babies have been switched.

                    CHILD LETA, IRMA, and BABY CREDENCE are in one boat,
                    CREDENCE'S AUNT and BABY CORVUS in another.

                    A huge wave is approaching. CHILD LETA watches as the
                    lifeboat bearing CREDENCE'S AUNT and BABY CORVUS is
                    overturned.

                    CLOSE ON: THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. A few survivors reappear,
                    including CREDENCE'S AUNT, but not BABY CORVUS... CREDENCE'S
                    AUNT pulls off her life jacket so she can dive too...

                    She does not reemerge. We close in through the surface of the
                    water, past the drowning woman, and see the dark shape of a
                    drowning baby trailing bubbles of magical light as he
                    sinks... and his figure becomes...

                    hanging in the air in the mausoleum. LETA has conjured it. It
                    has haunted her all her life and now she shows it to them.

                    The orchid representing LETA on the Lestrange family tree
                    twists around the branch labeled CORVUS LESTRANGE until the
                    leaves wither and die.

                    CREDENCE reacts.

                    An opening suddenly appears in the wall of the mausoleum. All
                    stare at the steps leading down into the earth. The sound of
                    a gigantic CROWD rumbles beneath them.

                    Before anyone can stop him, he runs down the steps. NEWT and

                    JACOB steps out of the narrow staircase into an underground
                    amphitheater and is confronted by a terrifying sight.

                    Thousands of witches and wizards mill around, some already
                    seated on stone benches. The atmosphere is edgy. Some are
                    nervous but curious. Others excited, still others ready for a
                    fight.

                    Masked ACOLYTES steward the crowd.

                    ANGLE ON: CREDENCE AND NAGINI entering the amphitheater.

                    Awed and intimidated by the sight, they are swept along in
                    the swell of people moving deeper into the auditorium.

                    NAGINI tries to hold CREDENCE back.

                                                   NAGINI
                                         They're purebloods. They kill the

                    He carries on walking.

                    NAGINI hesitates, then follows too.

                    Looking around, JACOB spots a familiar blond head -- QUEENIE,
                    being accompanied to a front row seat by an ACOLYTE.

                    She turns. Utter delight --

                                              (reading his mind)
                                         Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I never
                                         should have done it, I love you so
                                         much --

                                                   JACOB
                                         And you know that I love you,
                                         right?

                                                   QUEENIE
                                         Yeah.

                                                   JACOB
                                         Good, now let's get the hell out of
                                         here.

                    He tries to pull her back the way he came, but she tugs him
                    back.
                                                   QUEENIE
                                              (serious)
                                         Oh, wait. Wait a second. I just
                                         thought maybe we could hear him
                                         first. You know, just listen,
                                         that's all.

                                                   JACOB
                                         What are you talking about?



                                                                                          (CONTINUED)

 
                98.

     111            CONTINUED: (2)                                                              111
                    She pulls a confused JACOB into a seat beside her in the
                    front row, clutching his hand.

                    JACOB looks around nervously at all the purebloods.

                    ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA.

                    They are already in the crowd, TINA looking around for those
                    they have followed, but NEWT, perturbed, is starting to see
                    the bigger picture.

                                                   TINA
                                         It's a trap.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Yeah. Queenie -- the family tree --
                                         it's all been bait.

                    He looks around. ACOLYTES are moving to cover all the
                    entrances.

                                                    TINA
                                         We have to find a way out of here,
                                         right now.

                                                   NEWT
                                         You go find the others.

                                                   TINA
                                         What are you gonna do?

                                                   NEWT
                                         I'll think of something.

                    He sets off. She moves more slowly into the crowd, looking
                    for JACOB and CREDENCE.

                    ANGLE ON: AN ACOLYTE watching NEWT'S progress.

                    The lights dim. The crowd begins to cheer.


     112            INT. UNDERGROUND AMPHITHEATER  (NIGHT)                                       112

                    WE FOLLOW: GRINDELWALD onstage as the audience explodes with
                    delight.

                    Their hysteria builds as he stands there, part demagogue,
                    part rock star.

                    ANGLE ON: TINA edging through the crowd, searching.

                    She spots QUEENIE and, at a short distance, CREDENCE.

                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

 
                99.

     112            CONTINUED:                                                                  112
                    Whom should she approach first?

                    She chooses CREDENCE, but as she moves, is blocked by an
                    ACOLYTE. They make eye contact.

                    TINA knows she is wildly outnumbered. Under the ACOLYTE'S
                    gaze, she sinks onto a bench.

                    WE PAN OVER: the crowd.

                    WE SEE: QUEENIE, rapt --

                    -- and JACOB, low in his seat and scared...

                    KAMA, who is skeptical...

                    CREDENCE, transfixed --

                    -- and NAGINI, who trusts nobody...

                    LETA, studying GRINDELWALD, wondering...

                    ANGLE ON: GRINDELWALD, gesturing at the crowd to settle.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         My brothers, my sisters, my
                                         friends: the great gift of your
                                         applause is not for me.
                                              (off noises of denial)
                                         No. It is for yourselves.

                    ANGLE ON: LETA, amid the crowd.

                    She is not clapping, but she feels the pull of GRINDELWALD'S
                    charisma.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         You came today because of a craving
                                         and a knowledge that the old ways
                                         serve us no longer... You come
                                         today because you crave something
                                         new, something different.

                    ANGLE ON: CREDENCE, listening.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         It is said that I hate Les Non-
                                         Magiques. The Muggles. The No-Maj.
                                         The Can't-Spells.

                    Jeers and hisses from much of the crowd. JACOB sinks deeper
                    into his seat.


                                                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    QUEENIE is momentarily anxious; she seizes his hand: No,
                    wait, listen --

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         I do not hate them. I do not.

                    Silence from the crowd.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         For I do not fight out of hatred. I
                                         say the Muggles are not lesser, but
                                         other. Not worthless, but of other
                                         value. Not disposable, but of a
                                         different disposition.
                                              (beat)
                                         Magic blooms only in rare souls. It
                                         is granted to those who live for
                                         higher things. Oh, and what a world
                                         we could make, for all of humanity.
                                         We who live for freedom, for truth -
                                         -

                    His eyes meet QUEENIE'S in the front row.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         -- and for love.

                    WE PAN ACROSS: QUEENIE, now heart and soul his...


     113            EXT. P�RE LACHAISE CEMETERY  (NIGHT)                                              113

                    The figures of fifty AURORS appear in silhouette among the
                    mausoleums.

                    WE MOVE IN: and see that THESEUS is one of them.

                                                   THESEUS
                                         It isn't illegal to listen to him!
                                         Use minimum of force on the crowd.
                                         We mustn't be what he says we are!
                    But on other faces --

                    WE SEE: nervousness, even fear, and on a few, a clear will to
                    fight, to avenge.


     114            INT. UNDERGROUND AMPHITHEATER  (NIGHT)                                            114

                    BACK TO: GRINDELWALD onstage.



                                                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         The moment has come to share my
                                         vision of the future that awaits if
                                         we do not rise up and take our
                                         rightful place in the world.

                    ROSIER appears onstage. Bowing, she presents the skull-hookah
                    to GRINDELWALD.

                    Total silence falls in the auditorium. GRINDELWALD is
                    illuminated by the skull's golden light. He inhales deeply
                    through the tube. His eyes roll up into his head. He
                    exhales...

                    ... and it is extraordinary. A gigantic Technicolor cloak
                    seems to unfurl from his lips across the high stone ceiling,
                    bearing moving images--the crowd gasps --

                    Thousands of marching, booted feet... explosions, men running
                    with guns...

                    CLOSE ON: THE FACES OF THE CROWD, mesmerized and afraid, the
                    light of the vision playing across their faces.

                    CLOSE ON: NEWT, stunned.

                    The vision of a nuclear blast rocks the amphitheater. It is
                    horrifying. The crowd feels it, is terrified. Screams, until
                    the vision subsides, leaving murmurs of panic...

                    CLOSE ON: JACOB, horrified.

                                                   JACOB
                                         Not another war...

                    The vision fades. All eyes return to GRINDELWALD.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         That is what we are fighting! That
                                         is the enemy--their arrogance, their
                                         power lust, their barbarity. How
                                         long will it take before they turn
                                         their weapons on us?

                    WE PAN: around the exits and see AURORS, unnoticed, entering
                    the auditorium, fanning out among the crowd.

                    CLOSE ON: THESEUS, who is worried -- the situation is
                    volatile and could go badly wrong.

                    The crowd settles, agitated, expectant. They are waiting for
                    some new, extraordinary revelation.

                                         Do nothing when I speak of this.
                                         You must remain calm and contain
                                         your emotions.

                                         There are Aurors here among us.

                    Gasps. Heads turn.

                    We see the AURORS looking around in panic. They are wildly
                    outnumbered. The crowd is hostile.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                              (to the AURORS who have
                                              just entered)
                                         Come closer, brother wizards! Join
                                         us.

                    To mounting hisses and angry jeers, the AURORS know they have
                    no choice but to walk forward and show themselves.

                    ANGLE ON: LETA, turning to look.

                    She spots THESEUS.

                    A long, charged look between them.

                                                   THESEUS
                                              (to the other AURORS)
                                         Do nothing. No force.

                    But one of the jumpiest young AURORS has made eye contact
                    with the YOUNG RED-HAIRED WITCH.

                    She is angry, as twitchy as he is, fingering her wand.

                                                    GRINDELWALD
                                         They have killed many of my
                                         followers, it is true. They caught
                                         and tortured me in New York. They
                                         had struck down their fellow
                                         witches and wizards for the simple
                                         crime of seeking truth, for wanting
                                         freedom...

                    He is deliberately playing on the unstable YOUNG RED-HAIRED
                    WITCH'S feelings.

                    The YOUNG AUROR raises his wand a few inches. He can sense
                    her desire for violence --

                                         Your anger -- your desire for
                                         revenge -- is natural.

                    And it happens:

                    She raises her wand, but the YOUNG AUROR curses first.

                    To the horror of her companions, she falls, dead.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         No!

                    Screams fill the auditorium. GRINDELWALD ascends into the
                    crowd, which parts for him.
                    He kneels and pulls the YOUNG RED-HAIRED WITCH'S limp body
                    into his arms.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)

                                         Take this young warrior back to her
                                         family.

                    The Niffler, unnoticed, wriggles out from beneath
                    GRINDELWALD'S boot and disappears into the crowd.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         Disapparate. Leave. Go forth from
                                         this place and spread the word: It
                                         is not we who are violent.

                    They take the body and Disapparate, as does most of the
                    crowd.

                    THESEUS and the AURORS watch the purebloods leave.

                    THESEUS ushers his AURORS forward.

                                                   THESEUS
                                              (looking at GRINDELWALD)
                                         Let's take him.

                    They start to descend the amphitheater steps.

                    GRINDELWALD turns his back on the advancing AURORS, relishing
                    the fight to come.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         Protego diabolica.

                    He spins and draws a protective circle of black fire around
                    himself. The exits close.

                                                                                             (CONTINUED)

                    ABERNATHY, CARROW, KRAFFT, MACDUFF, NAGEL, and ROSIER walk
                    through the flames into the circle.

                    ANGLE ON: KRALL, hesitating. Then he decides the circle is
                    the better option, braces himself, runs into the fire --

                    -- and is consumed.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         Aurors, join me in this circle,
                                         pledge to me your eternal
                                         allegiance, or die. Only here shall
                                         you know freedom, only here shall
                                         you know yourself.

                    GRINDELWALD sends a wall of flames into the air, pursuing
                    fleeing AURORS.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)

                                         children.

                    NAGINI grabs CREDENCE and tries to drag him away with her,
                    but he is staring at GRINDELWALD.

                                                   CREDENCE
                                         He knows who I am.

                                         He knows what you were born, not
                                         who you are...

                    GRINDELWALD smiles at CREDENCE through the fire.

                    NEWT tries to fight the fire but it becomes more monstrous,
                    lashing out with eel-like spurs.

                    CREDENCE decides: Pulling free of NAGINI, he walks toward the
                    flames.

                    Devastated, NAGINI is forced back by the ever-expanding fire.

                    ANGLE ON: QUEENIE AND JACOB, who are pressed up against a
                    different stretch of wall.

                    black fire.

                    TINA retaliates, throwing a curse at GRINDELWALD, but the
                    circle of fire lashes out in ever more violent spears.

                    GRINDELWALD conducts the flames as though leading an
                    orchestra, the Elder Wand his baton, as the forks of fire
                    strike at AURORS attempting to Disapparate or flee.

                    Half-a-dozen AURORS lose their heads and run through the
                    flames to GRINDELWALD.

                    ANGLE ON: NEWT AND THESEUS standing together on the
                    amphitheater steps.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         Mr. Scamander. Do you think
                                         Dumbledore will mourn for you?

                    GRINDELWALD throws a large burst of black fire at them both,
                    and THESEUS and NEWT defend themselves.

                                                   LETA (O.S.)
                                         Grindelwald! Stop!

                    GRINDELWALD catches sight of LETA.

                                                    THESEUS
                                         Leta...

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         This one I believe I know.

                    THESEUS makes a gigantic effort of will, carving a passage
                    toward LETA, determined to reach her. They are using all
                    their skill to keep the flames at bay.

                    GRINDELWALD moves toward her through the flames as THESEUS
                    fights closer, desperate to reach her.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         Leta Lestrange... despised entirely
                                         amongst wizards... unloved,
                                         mistreated... yet brave. So very
                                         brave.
                                              (to LETA)
                                         Time to come home.

                    He stretches out his hand. She contemplates it.


                                                                                             (CONTINUED)

                    He looks at her, eyes narrowed.

                    She looks toward both THESEUS and NEWT, who are watching her,
                    stunned.

                                                   LETA
                                         I love you.

                    She points her wand at the skull in ROSIER'S hands, which
                    explodes.

                    ROSIER is knocked backward and GRINDELWALD is momentarily
                    obscured in a whirl of chaos.

                                                   LETA (CONT'D)

                    The fire engulfs LETA.

                    THESEUS goes wild. He tries to dive after her --

                    -- But NEWT grabs him and they Disapparate.

                    The fire, mirroring GRINDELWALD'S rage, explodes, chasing
                    them.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                              (whispers)
                                         I hate Paris.

                    NEWT and THESEUS, TINA with JACOB, and KAMA with NAGINI all
                    Apparate out from the amphitheater.

                    The black fire pursues them like a many- headed hydra,
                    erupting out of every mausoleum.

                    FLAMEL arrives at last.
                    The cemetery is on the verge of destruction. The fire
                    GRINDELWALD has unleashed is out of control. It forms dragon-
                    like creatures intent on annihilation.

                                                   FLAMEL
                                         TOGETHER! In a circle, your wand

                                         be lost!

                    Our heroes, minus JACOB, make a circle, plunge their wands
                    into the earth.

                    It takes almost superhuman power to contain GRINDELWALD'S
                    demonic fire, which they are forced to combat with flames
                    still more deadly.

                    United, our heroes fight...

                    And at last, their purifying fire drives GRINDELWALD'S back.
                    The entrances to the underground lair are sealed.

                    They have saved the city.

                    FLAMEL comforts JACOB. NAGINI sits in the darkness, tearful.

                    NEWT shuffles over awkwardly to the bereft THESEUS. NEWT
                    hesitates, struggling to find words of comfort.

                    Then, for the first time in his life, he puts his arms around
                    his brother. They hug.

                                                   NEWT
                                         I've chosen my side.

                    The Niffler hobbles over to NEWT, who picks him up...

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                              (to the Niffler)
                                         Come on. Yeah. No, you're okay.

                    ...then notices GRINDELWALD'S vial in its paws.

                    He takes the pendant, amazed. NEWT tucks both the vial and
                    Niffler inside his coat.

                    DUMBLEDORE is walking across the viaduct from Hogwarts,
                    toward NEWT, JACOB, TINA, THESEUS, NAGINI, KAMA, TRAVERS, and
                    assorted AURORS, who stand at the other end.

                    NEWT walks ahead alone to meet DUMBLEDORE.

                    TRAVERS moves to stop him.




                                                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                         I think it's best if he speaks to
                                         him alone.

                    TRAVERS opens his mouth to protest. Meets THESEUS'S gaze.
                    Nods curtly.

                    NEWT walks along toward DUMBLEDORE. They meet in the middle
                    of the viaduct.


     117            EXT. AUSTRIA, NURMENGARD CASTLE WINDOW - DAWN                                    117

                    CREDENCE is staring out at the sky, scared of what he has
                    done but awed by the magnificent vista.

                    WE PAN OUT TO SEE: Nurmengard, high on its mountain.


     118            INT. NURMENGARD CASTLE, SIDE ROOM - DAWN                                         118

                    GRINDELWALD and QUEENIE are watching CREDENCE through the
                    half-open door into a grand drawing room.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                              (whispers)
                                         Is he frightened of me still?

                                                   QUEENIE
                                              (whispers)
                                         You need to be careful... He's not
                                         sure he made the right choice. Be
                                         very gentle with him.

                    She smiles as he bows her out through a separate door.

                    Once he is sure she has gone, he walks into the drawing room
                    to join CREDENCE.

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         I have a gift for you, my boy.

                    From behind his back he takes a handsome wand.

                    With a bow, he presents it to CREDENCE, who cannot believe
                    his eyes.

                    We see that DUMBLEDORE is hollow-eyed. His usual calm has
                    gone. He's a man at the end of his tether.

                                                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         Is it true about Leta?

                    NEWT nods.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Yes.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                         I'm so sorry.

                    NEWT pulls out the vial.

                    DUMBLEDORE stares at it, simultaneously tormented and amazed.

                                                   NEWT
                                         It's a blood pact, isn't it? You
                                         swore not to fight each other.

                    Bitterly ashamed, DUMBLEDORE nods.

                                                   DUMBLEDORE
                                              (overcome)
                                         How in the name of Merlin did you
                                         manage to get... ?

                    The Niffler pokes its head out of NEWT'S jacket, sad to see
                    the pendant go.

                                                   NEWT
                                         Grindelwald doesn't seem to
                                         understand the nature of things he
                                         considers simple.

                    DUMBLEDORE raises his hands to show the Admonitors.

                    CLOSE ON: THESEUS. He raises his wand.

                    BACK TO: DUMBLEDORE AND NEWT. The Admonitors fall from
                    DUMBLEDORE'S wrists.

                    The vial--blood troth--hangs in the air between them.

                                                   NEWT (CONT'D)
                                         Can you destroy it?

                    Overcome, tearful, he tries to speak cheerfully.

                    They turn to walk back toward Hogwarts.

                                         teaspoons.

                    The others walk slowly after them.


     120            INT. NURMENGARD CASTLE - DAWN                                                   120

                                                   GRINDELWALD
                                         You have suffered the most heinous
                                         of betrayals, most purposely
                                         bestowed upon you by your own
                                         blood. Your own flesh and blood.
                                         And just as he has celebrated your
                                         torment, your brother seeks to
                                         destroy you.

                    CREDENCE inhales sharply. His chick steps gingerly onto
                    GRINDELWALD'S palm.

                    GRINDELWALD throws it in the air, where it catches alight.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         There is a legend in your family
                                         that a phoenix will come to any
                                         member who is in dire need.

                    Given room at last, the bird stretches its wings and becomes
                    full size. The bird is aflame, a phoenix reborn.

                                                   GRINDELWALD (CONT'D)
                                         It is your birthright, my boy. As
                                         is the name I now restore to you.
                                              (whispers)
                                         Aurelius. Aurelius Dumbledore.

                    CREDENCE turns. The power of his Obscurus can at last be
                    channeled.

                    He points the wand at the window and a spell of immense power
                    shatters the glass and breaks apart the mountain opposite.

                    CREDENCE stands staring through the shattered glass at his
                    handiwork.

                    He is extraordinary, and this is just his beginning.



                                               END
