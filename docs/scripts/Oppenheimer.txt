1     A VAST SPHERE OF FIRE, the fire of a thousand suns, slowly       1
      EATS the nighttime desert. A line of black type appears:
      "Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and gave it to man."
      And the sound of DOZENS OF FEET STAMPING RHYTHMICALLY...
      "For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity."
      ROILING PLASMA expands, the sound of STAMPING GROWS
      OPPRESSIVE, the STAMPING FASTER and FASTER over-
2     A FACE. Gaunt, tense. EYES TIGHTLY SHUT. The face SHUDDERS-          2
      the sound CEASES as my EYES OPEN, STARING INTO CAMERA:
      Peer into my soul- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, aged 50, close
      cropped greying hair. The gentle sounds of bureaucracy...

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                Dr.Oppenheimer, as we begin, I believe
                you have a statement to read into
                the record?

      I glance down at my notes.

                            OPPENHEIMER
                Yes, Your Honour-
                            SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                We're not judges, Doctor.

                No.  Of course.

                Members of the Security Board, the
                so-called derogatory information in
                your indictment of me cannot be fairly
                understood except in the context of
                my life and my work. This answer is
                a summary of relevant aspects of my
                life in more or less chronological

3     INT. SENATE OFFICE - DAY (BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE)           3
      Close on a prosperous 63-year old man, LEWIS STRAUSS, as he
      takes a cup of coffee from a SENATE AIDE...
      Super title: " 2. FUSION "
                            STRAUSS
                I forget. Three days, or so.    The
                whole hearing took a month.
                              SENATE AIDE
                An ordeal.
                            STRAUSS
                I've only read the transcript, but
                who'd want to justify their whole
                life?
                            SENATE AIDE
                You weren't there?
                            STRAUSS
                As Chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.
                Are they really going to ask about
                it? It was years ago.
                            SENATE AIDE
                Four years ago. Oppenheimer still
                divides America- the Committee will
                want to know where you stood.
                    (checks his watch)
                Ready?

      The Senate Aide leads Strauss along the corridor.
                            SENATE AIDE
                Senator Thurmond asked me to say not
                to feel you're on trial.
                            STRAUSS
                I didn't, till you said that.
                            SENATE AIDE
                Really, Mr Strauss-
                              STRAUSS
                Admiral.
                            SENATE AIDE
                Admiral Strauss, this is a formality.

      They arrive at the door.
                               STRAUSS
                   And if they bring up Oppenheimer?
                                SENATE AIDE
                   When they bring up Oppenheimer, answer
                   honestly and no Senator can deny
                   that you did your duty. It'll be
                   uncomfortable...

                               OPPENHEIMER
                   Sure. Once I built it. First I had
                   to go to Europe. I went to Cambridge
                   to work under Patrick Blackett.

                   No. I was homesick. Emotionally

                 your relationship with Dr.J Robert
                 Oppenheimer. You met in 1947?
                               STRAUSS
                 Correct.

                 as board member of the Institute for
                 Advanced Study at Princeton. After

                    The greatest scientific mind of our

                    Of his time. Einstein published his
                    theory of Relativity more than 40
                    years ago, but never embraced the

                                OPPENHEIMER

                    I had offers. But I chose to sell
                    shoes.

                    Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe
                    salesman?
                                STRAUSS
                    No.  Just a shoe salesman.

                    Nobody's denying his insight. It's
                    his laboratory skills that leave a
                    little to be desired.
                                YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
                    I heard you give the same lecture-
                                BOHR
                    At Harvard. And you asked the same
                    question. Why ask again?
                                YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
                    I hadn't liked your answer.

                    You don't enjoy the lab?
       I shake my head. Bohr GESTICULATES with the apple as he talks-
       I watch it bob around- a kitten following a ball of string...

       Strauss watches Oppenheimer hand the HAT to Einstein. Strauss

                    So, Dr.Oppenheimer brought your
                    attention to his past associations
                    before you appointed him?

                    Just then I was more concerned about
                    what he'd said to Einstein to sour
                    him on me.

                 Probably because you inspired it.

                    Quantum mechanics says it's both-

                    It can't. But it is. It's
                    paradoxical and yet... it works.
       Lomanitz is hooked. I turn to the board, chalk out an
       equation... when I turn back-
       There are now FIVE students (including SERBER and SNYDER)

                    I've sampled the Berkeley political
                    scene- it's all philosophy post-grads
                    and Communists talking integration.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    You don't care about integration?

                    I want to vote for it, not talk about

                    I'm meeting my brother there.
                                SENATOR BARTLETT (V.O.)
                    Dr.Oppenheimer's file contained
                    details of F.B.I. surveillance on
                    his activities at Berkeley...

                                STRAUSS
                    Yes, as I recall.
                                SENATOR BARTLETT
                    Why would they have started a file
                    on Dr.Oppenheimer before the war?
                                STRAUSS
                    You'd have to ask Mr.Hoover.
                                SENATOR BARTLETT
                    I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.
                                STRAUSS
                    My assumption is that it was connected
                    to his left-wing political activities.
                                SENATOR BARTLETT
                    How would these activities have come
                    to the attention of the F.B.I.?
                                STRAUSS
                    Well, if I remember correctly...

35     EXT. HOUSE PARTY, SHASTA ROAD, BERKELEY - NIGHT (COLOUR)        35
                             STRAUSS (V.O.)
                 The F.B.I. was taking license plates
                 outside suspected Communist gatherings
                 and his name popped up.
       As I get out of my car, I spot TWO MEN checking the license
       plates of cars on the street... I am GRABBED-

                 Robert!    Come meet Chevalier.
       Mary WASHBURN grabs my tie and leads us to Haakon CHEVALIER.

                             CHEVALIER
                 And your reputation precedes you.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 I'm blushing- what've you heard?
                             CHEVALIER
                 You're teaching a radical new approach
                 to physics that I have no chance of
                 understanding. But I hadn't heard
                 you were a party member-

                    The Spanish Civil War?
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    A democratic republic being overthrown
                    by fascist thugs? Who wouldn't?
                                CHEVALIER
                    Our government- they think socialism's
                    a bigger threat than fascism.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    Not for long- look at what the Nazis
                    are doing to the Jews. I send funds

                    I have to do something. My own work
                    is so... abstract.

                    Do stars die?

                    If they   do they'd cool, then collapse.
                    And the   bigger the star, the more
                    violent   its demise. Their gravity
                    gets so   concentrated...

                 If we can get published, maybe one
                 day an astronomer finds one. But
                 all I have is theory. Which can't
                 impact people's lives.
                             CHEVALIER
                 If you're sending money to Spain, do
                 it through the Communist Party- they
                 can get it to the front lines.
       The beguiling young woman is there with a tray of martinis.
       This is Jean TATLOCK...
                             TATLOCK
                 Mary sent me with these.     I'm Jean.

                             CHEVALIER (CONT'D)
                 Robert here says he's not a communist.
                             TATLOCK
                 Then he doesn't know enough about
                 it.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 I've read 'Das Kapital'. All three
                 volumes. Does that count?
                             CHEVALIER
                 That would make you better read than
                 most party members.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 It's turgid stuff, but there's some
                 thinking... 'Ownership is theft'.
                             TATLOCK
                 'Property', not 'Ownership'.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 Sorry, I read it in the original
                 German.
       Chevalier laughs, delighted, as he leaves us alone.

                 You're a physicist- do you pick and

                    Wow. Took my analysts two years,

                    I'm learning-
       She climbs on top of me, opens the book in my face.

                 Go on, then.
       I study the page as Tatlock starts to move.

                 Read the words.
       She points to each word as I translate...

                 "And now I am become Death...

       Moving over the VAST landscape to find three tiny figures.
       I lead Lawrence and Frank on horseback up a mountain trail.
39     EXT. CAMP SITE - EVENING                                        39
       THUNDER. Lawrence climbs off his horse.     The wind WHIPS as
       we set up our tent...
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 It'll break before dawn. The air
                 cools overnight. Just before dawn,
                 the storm dies.
40     INT./EXT TENT - NIGHT                                           40
       Lawrence, Frank and I huddle in the BUFFETING TENT, trying
       to keep a fire going in the WIND and RAIN outside the tent.
                             FRANK
                 I'm getting married.
                             LAWRENCE
                 Congratulations, Frank.
      I look at Frank, sardonic with drink.
                               OPPENHEIMER
                 To Jackie?
      Frank stares at me... the tent stops buffeting...

                    Yeah, to Jackie. The waitress.
                                LAWRENCE
                        (sensing tension)
                    Oppie, you're right- it's letting
                    up. I'll see if there's any stars.
       Frank watches Lawrence go, then pounces-
                                FRANK
                    All your talk about the common man
                    but Jackie's not good enough? We
                    join the Party- you can't hide your
                    disapproval- why? Because that's
                    supposed to be your thing-?
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    I haven't joined the party, Frank.
                    And I don't think she should've
                    convinced you to, either-
                                FRANK
                    Half the faculty's Communist-
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    Not that half.
       I point in the direction Lawrence wandered off.
                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    I'm your brother, and I want you to
                    be cautious.
                                FRANK
                    And I want to wring your neck.
       I giggle at this. Frank shakes his head, then starts
       laughing, too. I grab Frank's shoulder. Frank looks up...
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Robert, I won't live my life afraid
                    to make a mistake.
       I hold up my hands in defeat-
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    You're happy, I'm happy.
                                FRANK
                    Then I'm happy you're happy.
41     EXT. PERRO CALIENTE - MOMENTS LATER                               41
       I approach Lawrence, who stares up at the stars.

                                LAWRENCE
                    It's so clear I feel like I could
                    see one of those dark stars you're
                    working on...
                                OPPENHEIMER

       INSERT CUT: AN EXPANDING DARKNESS EATS THE STARS...

                    Their gravity swallows light. It's
                    like a kind of... hole in space.
                                LAWRENCE
                    Is Frank okay?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                    Yeah.   He just has a shitty brother.
       Lawrence smiles at this.      Looks around them.
                                LAWRENCE
                    It's special here.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    As a kid I thought if I could find a
                    way to combine physics and New Mexico,
                    my life would be perfect.
                                LAWRENCE
                    It's a little remote for that.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    Let's get some sleep.
       I turn, heading to the tent.      Lawrence follows.
                                OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    That mesa we saw today? One of my
                    favorite places in the world.
                    Tomorrow we'll climb it.
                                LAWRENCE
                    What's it called?
       My response is so soft it is almost swallowed by the dark...

       hand- she folds her arms.

                    I have to make an appointment?
       Across the street a Young Man BURSTS out of the BARBER SHOP,
       towel across chest, NEWSPAPER in hand... the Barber runs out-
       the Young Man rips off the towel, TOSSES it to him and RUNS-

                    Alvarez!

43     EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - DAY                                      43
       Alvarez SPRINTS, newspaper in hand- I follow-
44     INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY - CONTINUOUS                           44
       I BURST in- Lawrence is trying to calm Alvarez-
                                ALVAREZ
                        (breathless)
                    They've done it! Hahn and Strassmann
                    in Germany...
       Alvarez tosses the paper at me-
                                ALVAREZ (CONT'D)
                    They split the uranium nucleus.

                    How?
                                OPPENHEIMER
                        (reading)
                    Bombarded it with neutrons.
                                ALVAREZ
                    Lawrence, it's fission. Nuclear
                    fission. They've split the atom...
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    It's not possible.
       I put down the paper, take up my chalk like it's a weapon,
       move to the board. Alvarez grabs the paper-
                                ALVAREZ
                    I'm going to try to reproduce it.

                 Theory will take you only so far.
       I stand, moving away... thinking...

                 During the process extra neutrons
                 boil off. Which could be used to
                 split other uranium atoms...
                             LAWRENCE
                 A chain reaction. You're thinking

                 Sure.    When do we-
       Eltenton pushes me onto the stage. People start APPLAUDING
       at the very sight of me. I can't quite not smile about this.

                 Teachers are unionized, Lawrence.
                 Why not professors?

                 I'll sit in.

                 Not this one.
       The door opens.    Richard TOLMAN and Vannevar BUSH enter-

                 Richard. Dr.Bush. What brings you
                 two up north?
       They exchange glances with Lawrence.    Awkward SILENCE.   I

                 And after Hitler invaded Russia, did
                 these Communist sympathies return?

                    sharp break with those who held
                    different views. For a year or two
                    during a previous marriage my wife,
                    Kitty, had been a Communist Party
                    member.
       Behind me, on a couch, is KITTY(46), listening intently...

                    But when I first met her, in Pasadena
                    in 1939, she had already disengaged
                    from politics...

                    This is where I keep the good stuff.

                    I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

                    I live with them when I'm at Caltech.

                    You two need anything?
       I turn to see RUTH TOLMAN(45) looking at me, mischievous.

                    We're fine, Ruthie.

                    Can you explain quantum mechanics to
                    me? It seems baffling.

       Kitty pushes her fingers through mine, interlacing our hands.
       I look at a GREY-HAIRED MAN in conversation with Tolman...
                                OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    You're married to Dr.Harrison.

                    Not very.

                    Well, there's someone that I...

                    Sometimes.   Not often enough.
       As Ruth looks our way I let Kitty's hand go.
                                OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    I'm going to New Mexico, to my ranch.
                    With friends. You should come.
       Kitty looks meaningfully over her glass at me.
                                OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    I meant with your husband.
                                KITTY
                    Yes, you did. Because you know it

                    I was lost.    He was kind.

                    Nobody. But my second husband was
                    Joe Dallet. From money, like me,
                    but he was a union organizer in
                    Youngstown, Ohio. I fell hard.

                    How hard?
                                KITTY
                    Hard enough to spend four years living
                    off beans and pancakes, handing out
                    the Daily Worker at factory gates.
       Kitty takes out a hip flask.       SWIGS.

                    By '36 I told Joe I couldn't take it
                    anymore, quit the party and joined
                    my parents swanning around Europe.
                    A year later I said I wanted him
                    back. Him, not the Daily Worker.
                    He said 'swell, I'll meet you on my
                    way to Spain'.
       She hands me the flask.       I take a drink.

                    On his way we reconciled. One

                                TATLOCK
                    You knocked her up.   Fast work.

                    Can't keep a good man down.
                                TATLOCK
                    I meant her. She knew what she
                    wanted. What about the husband?
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    We spoke. He's divorcing her so we
                    can get married before she's showing.
                                TATLOCK
                    How civilized, you idiot. This is
                    your community- you think rules don't
                    apply to the golden boy?

                    the world who understand what you

                    the most respected scientific voice
                    in the world. That's why I asked
                    him to run the Institute, that's why
                    he advised the Atomic Energy
                    Commission. Simple as that.

                    This was the McCarthy era- people
                    hounded out of jobs for any hint of
                    red... reading Oppenheimer's security
                    file- his Communist brother, sister-
                    in-law, fianc�e, best friend, wife...
                    that's before you even get to the
                    Chevalier incident.

                    But how would Borden have access to
                    Oppenheimer's security file?
                                STRAUSS
                    Someone gave it to him. Someone who
                    wanted Oppenheimer silenced.

                    not to upset the power brokers in
                    Washington. His opinions on the
                    atom became definitive and he wasn't
                    always patient with us mere mortals.
                    I came in for plenty of harsh
                    treatment. There was an AEC vote on
                    the export of isotopes to Norway...

                    you do. You could use a bottle of

       LAUGHTER.    Strauss squirms, embarrassed.

                    Isotopes aren't as useful as
                    electronic components, but more useful
                    than a sandwich. I'd put them
                    somewhere in between.

61     EXT./INT. CHEVALIER HOUSE - NIGHT                              61
       I carry the crying infant, PETER, to the front door. Knock.
       Barbara opens it- sees my distraught face and takes Peter.
62     INT. LIVING ROOM, CHEVALIER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER              62
       Chevalier hands me a drink.   I stare into the liquid.

64     INT. PRESIDENT'S DINING HALL, BERKELEY - DAY                      64
       A crowded and lavish lunch. I notice a large man in ARMY
       UNIFORM, Colonel GROVES, sitting next to another Soldier
       (NICHOLS) with Bush and Tolman. I sidle up to Lawrence at
       the buffet.

       Groves pulls off his uniform jacket, TOSSES it to Nichols.

                    Get that dry-cleaned.
       I watch Nichols leave.

                 Hitler called quantum physics 'Jewish
                 science'. Said it right to Einstein's
                 face. Our one hope is that Hitler's
                 so blinded by hate he's denied
                 Heisenberg proper resources. Because
                 it'll take vast resources. Our
                 nation's best scientists, working
                 together- right now they're scattered.
                             GROVES
                 Which gives us compartmentalization.

                 All minds have to see the whole task

                 security may cost us the race,
                 inefficiency will. The Germans know
                 more than us, anyway.

                 Why?
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 If we don't let scientists bring
                 their families, we'll never get the
                 best. You want security? Build a

       Groves emerges, squinting into the brightness, taking in the
       stark beauty. I greet him, arms spread wide.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 Welcome to Los Alamos. There's a
                 boys' school we'll have to commandeer,
                 and the local Indians come up here
                 for burial rites. Other than that,
                 nothing for forty miles any direction.
                 And Southeast, hundreds of miles of
                 desert. Enough to find the perfect
                 spot.
                               GROVES
                 For?
                               OPPENHEIMER

       Groves scans the horizon.   Sniffs the air... turns to Nichols.

                    I got all the soldier I need. Maybe
                    too much. I'm here because you know

       I glance at Groves.         Then CROSS my legs.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    It's about unleashing the strong

                                OPPENHEIMER
                    Hello, Edward.
79     INT. SAME - DAY                                                   79
       I sit at the front, one long leg tucked under my ass. The
       scientists include Lawrence, Serber, Teller, BETHE, Condon,
       Tolman, Feynman, Donald, Bainbridge, NEDDERMEYER and Alvarez.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    We'll work here until the t-section
                    at Los Alamos is finished-
       I see Teller waving a piece of paper-
                                OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                    Edward, can I get through my summary?
                                TELLER
                    This is more important.
       Teller's paper is passed around the room, scientists PALING...
                                TELLER (CONT'D)
                    Calculating chain reactions... I
                    found a rather troubling possibility.
       Hans Bethe hands me the paper, turns to Teller.
                                BETHE
                    That can't be right. Show me how
                    you did your calculations.
                                 TELLER
                    Of course.
       I look up from the paper, grave. Teller watches the ruckus
       he's caused with evident satisfaction. Bethe approaches.
                                BETHE
                    Oppie, this is fantasy. Teller's
                    calculations cannot be right.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    Do them yourself while I go to
                    Princeton.
                                 BETHE
                    What for?

                    To talk to Einstein.
                                BETHE
                    There's not much common ground between
                    you two.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                    That's why I should get his view.
80     EXT. WOODS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY - DAY                             80
       I walk through the trees, gaining on two figures.       The two
       men turn. One them is Einstein.
                                EINSTEIN
                    Dr.Oppenheimer. Have you met Kurt
                    Godel? We walk here most days.
                                GODEL
                    Trees are the most inspiring
                    structures.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                    Albert,   might I have a word?
       Einstein senses the gravity.     Nods.   They leave Godel staring
       up at the bare trees.
                                EINSTEIN
                    Some days Kurt refuses to eat. Even
                    in Princeton, he's convinced the
                    Nazis can poison his food.
81     EXT. LAKE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY - MOMENTS LATER             81
       Einstein and I emerge from the trees, I pull a piece of paper
       from my breast pocket. Einstein takes it.
                                EINSTEIN
                    Who's work is this?

                    And what do you take it to mean?

                 It would ignite the atmosphere.
       The air around us CATCHES FIRE... THE PLANET EARTH, LONELY
       IN VAST DARKNESS, IS SUDDENLY ENGULFED IN FIRE.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 When we detonate an atomic device,
                 we might start a chain reaction that
                 destroys the world.
                             EINSTEIN
                 And here we are, lost in your quantum
                 world of probabilities, but needing
                 certainty.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 Can you run the calculations yourself?
                             EINSTEIN
                 About the only thing you and I share
                 is a disdain for mathematics. Who's
                 working on it at Berkeley?
                               OPPENHEIMER

                 He'll get to the truth.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 And if the truth is catastrophic?
                             EINSTEIN
                 Then you stop. And share your
                 findings with the Nazis, so neither
                 side destroys the world.
       I turn to leave.

       I come past the secretaries. Bethe is there, excited.
                             BETHE
                 Teller's wrong-
       I gesture SILENCE as I unlock the rad lab-

83     INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY - CONTINUOUS                            83
       Bethe runs to the cabinet- takes out some papers- hands them
       to me, excited. I start to scan them, GRINNING-
                             BETHE
                 When you narrow Teller's critical
                 assumptions the real picture emerges-
                                OPPENHEIMER
                 Bottom line?
                             BETHE
                 The chances of an uncontrolled nuclear
                 reaction are near zero.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                 Near zero?
                             BETHE
                 Oppie, this is good news-
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 Can you run more calculations?
                             BETHE
                 You'll get the same answer. Until
                 we actually detonate one of these
                 things, the best assurance you're
                 going to get is this-
                     (jabs paper)
                 Near zero.
                             OPPENHEIMER
                 Theory will take you only so far.

                                CHEVALIER
                    Yeah. He was moaning about the way
                    we're handling the war.

                    Lack of cooperation with our allies.
                    Apparently, our government isn't
                    sharing any research with the
                    Russians. He said a lot of scientists
                    think the policy's stupid.

                                CHEVALIER
                    Yeah. He mentioned that if anyone
                    had information they wanted to pass
                    on, going around official channels,
                    he could help...

                    You act like a defense attorney, the

                    of fissionable material into the
                    larger sphere with enough force to
                    achieve criticality.

                    I've been thinking about implosion.
                    Explosives around the sphere blast
                    inwards, crushing the material.

                     School's up and running. I thought
                     of a way to reduce support staff...
        I open the door to the cabin containing my office-

                     Mrs.Serber. I've offered jobs to
                     all the wives. Admin., librarians,
                     computation. We cut down on staff

                     You're aware that the Nazis have a
                     two year head start?
                                 NICHOLS
                     Dr.Oppenheimer, the fact that your
                     security clearance is proving
                     difficult to obtain is not my fault.
                     It's yours.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     It may not be your fault, but it's
                     your problem. Because I'm going.

                     Too many. Compartmentalization was
                     supposed to be the protocol.

                     We were in a race against the Nazis-
                                 STRAUSS
                     Well, now the race is against the
                     Soviets.

        Strauss holds up the filter papers.

                     Robert, they just fired the starting
                     gun. What's the nature of the device
                     they detonated?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     The data indicates it may have been
                     a plutonium implosion device.
                                 STRAUSS
                     Like the one you built at Los Alamos?
        Oppenheimer nods reluctantly...
                                 STRAUSS (CONT'D)
                     If the Soviets have a bomb, Truman
                     needs to know what's next.
        Bush nods.    Oppenheimer looks incredulous-
                                    OPPENHEIMER
                     What's next?     Arms talks. Obviously.

                         (to Bush)
                     What about the Super?    Does Truman
                     even know about it?
                                 BUSH
                     Not specifically.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     We still don't know if a Hydrogen
                     bomb is technically feasible.
                                 STRAUSS
                     My understanding is that Teller first
                     proposed it at Los Alamos.

                  His designs have always been wildly

                              STRAUSS
                  If it could put us ahead again, Truman
                  needs to know about it. And if
                  there's a possibility that the
                  Russians know about it from a spy at
                  Los Alamos... we've gotta get going.

                     Compartmentalization is the protocol
                     we agreed to.

                     You've got to be kidding me. Enough
                     of this madhouse- nobody can work
                     under these conditions.
                         (to Groves)
                     You know what, Generalissimo? I
                     quit.

                     Thanks for nothing.

                     Aren't you more worried about his

                     You didn't hire me despite my left-
                     wing past, you hired me because of
                     it. So you could control me.

                     I'm not that subtle.   I'm just a

                  Now that we understand each other,
                  perhaps you'll get me my security
                  clearance, so I can perform this

                              GARRISON (V.O.)
                  General Groves, were you aware of
                  Dr.Oppenheimer's left wing
                  associations when you appointed him?

                  I was aware that there were suspicions
                  about him... I was aware that he
                  had a very extreme liberal background.
                              GARRISON
                  In your opinion, would he ever
                  consciously commit a disloyal act?
                              GROVES
                  I would be amazed if he did.
                              GARRISON
                  You had complete confidence in his
                  integrity?

                  At Los Alamos, yes, which is where I
                  really knew him.
                              ROBB
                  General, did your security officers
                  on the project advise against the
                  clearance of Dr.Oppenheimer?
                              GROVES
                  Truer to say they could not and would
                  not clear him. Until I insisted.

                  You became pretty familiar with the

                     Would you clear Dr.Oppenheimer today?

                     update you on our progress and solicit
                     your input. To do so I will be sharing

                     There were reports of espionage from
                     Los Alamos-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Unsubstantiated reports-
                                 STRAUSS
                     I've heard there were Communists on
                     the project- were any of them involved
                     with discussions of the Super?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     We didn't knowingly employ any
                     Communists.
                                 NICHOLS
                     I seem to remember you demanding
                     that your brother come to Los Alamos.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     He'd left the party by then.

                     And Lomanitz?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     He was never employed at Los Alamos,
                     he was a liaison. Our security was
                     tight, as former Colonel Nichols
                     well knows.
                                 NICHOLS
                     Our security was the tightest we
                     could make it given the personalities
                     involved. But attempts were made.
                     Doctor, we've all read your file
                     here. Do we need to talk about Jean
                     Tatlock? Or the Chevalier incident?

                     Lomanitz just got drafted.

                     Don't be an asshole, Nichols. We

                                 NICHOLS
                     It wasn't a mistake. Your friend
                     Lomanitz has been trying to unionize
                     the Radiation Lab.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     He promised to quit all that.
                                 NICHOLS
                     Well, he hasn't. The security officer
                     at Berkeley is concerned about
                     Communist infiltration through that
                     union- the... F.A...

        Tatlock GRABS the flowers.       As I follow her in, she DUMPS

                     You said in your statement you 'had'
                     to visit Jean Tatlock in 1943...

        Tatlock and I sit across the room from each other, naked.
                                 TATLOCK
                     You left. Not a word. What did you
                     think that would do to me?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     I wrote.
                                 TATLOCK
                     Pages of nothing. Where'd you go?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     I can't tell you.
                                 TATLOCK
                     Why not?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Because you're a Communist.

                     Why did you have to see her?
121     INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION - DAY                   121
        I sit at the table, self conscious, testifying...
                                  OPPENHEIMER
                     She had indicated a great desire to
                     see me before we left. At that time
                     I couldn't. But I felt that she had
                     to see me...
        Kitty watches me testify.    I am NAKED...
                                 OPPENHEIMER (CONT'D)
                     She was undergoing psychiatric
                     treatment. She was extremely unhappy.
                                 ROBB
                     Did you find out why she had to see
                     you?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Because she was still in love with
                     me.

        Kitty watches Tatlock, also naked, STRADDLE me, head on my
        shoulder, facing Kitty...
                                 ROBB
                     You spent the night with her didn't
                     you?
        As Tatlock GRINDS on me she locks eyes with Kitty...
                                   OPPENHEIMER
                     Yes.
122     INT. ROOM 805, HOTEL, SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT                       122
        Tatlock studies me from across the room.
                                 TATLOCK
                     You drop in and out of my life and
                     don't have to tell me why. That's
                     power.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Not that I enjoy. I'd rather be
                     here for you as you need.
                                 TATLOCK
                     But now you've got other priorities.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     I have a wife and child.
                                 TATLOCK
                     That's not what either of us is
                     talking about.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Jean, you asked me to come. And I'm
                     glad I did. But I can't come again.
                                 TATLOCK
                     What if I need you?
        I slowly shake my head.
                                   TATLOCK (CONT'D)
                     Not a word?

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     It was, as a matter of fact.   Not a
                     word.
                                 ROBB
                     When did you see her after that?
        INSERT CUT: HOT BATH RUNNING. PILL BOTTLE. DOWNTURNED HEAD

        I JAM my eyes closed, shake off the image-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     I never saw her again.

        As the room breaks up, Kitty speaks privately to me through
        CLENCHED TEETH as she gathers her things. No eye contact.

                     I can make the last train back to
                     Princeton.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     I said nothing that I hadn't already
                     said to you, Kitty.
                                 KITTY
                     Well, today you said it to history.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     This is a closed hearing-

        She DROPS her bag, spilling the contents. Garrison spots a

                     I was under oath.

                     You were under an oath to me when
                     you went to see Jean.
        She STANDS- I follow- She TURNS back- in my face-

                     Dr.Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
                     Please, take a seat-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     No need. I just wanted to check
                     whether I should talk to Lomanitz
                     while I'm here- given your concerns.
                                 JOHNSON
                     That's up to you, really, Professor.
                     But I'd be cautious.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Understood. Oh, and as far as the
                     union goes, I wanted to give you a
                     heads up on a man named Eltenton.
                                   JOHNSON
                     A heads up?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     He might merit watching, is all.
                                 JOHNSON
                     I'd love to get more details-

                     I've got an appointment now, and I

                  Results of surveillance conducted on

                  met with and spent considerable time

                  The subject being Dr.Oppenheimer?

                  Whom you had not met?

                  kidnap him, take him out on a boat,

                  Dr.Oppenheimer, this is a pleasure.
                  General Groves has placed a certain
                  responsibility in me, and it's like
                  having a child, that you can't see,
                  by remote control, so to actually
                  meet you... I don't mean to take
                  much of your time...
        The disarming friendliness of the truly dangerous.
                                OPPENHEIMER
                  Not at all.    Whatever time you choose.
                              PASH
                  Mr.Johnson told me of your
                  conversation yesterday, in which I'm
                  very interested. It had me worried
                  all day...
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz
                  without authorization-
                              PASH
                  That's not the particular interest I
                  have. It's something a little more,

                  When the F.B.I. pointed out that
                  such information couldn't be used in
                  court Pash made it clear that he
                  didn't intend to have anyone left to
                  prosecute. The F.B.I. talked him
                  down, but that's the man you're
                  dancing with.

                  I gather you've heard there are other
                  parties interested in the work of
                  the Radiation Lab...

                  Well, a man attached to the Soviet
                  Consul indicated, through intermediate
                  people, to people on this project
                  that he was in a position to transmit
                  information they might supply.
                              PASH
                  Why would anyone on the project want
                  that?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  Frankly, I can see there might be
                  arguments for the Commander in Chief
                  informing the Russians- they're our
                  allies. But I don't like the idea
                  of it going out the back door- it
                  might not hurt to be on the lookout
                  for it.

                  I was trying to put it in the
                  context of... Russia's not Germany.
                              GROVES
                  Boris Pash is the son of a Russian
                  Orthodox bishop. Born here, but in
                  1918 he went back to Russia to fight
                  the Bolsheviks. This is a man who's
                  killed Communists with his own hands.

                  I'm not the judge of who should or
                  should not get information. My
                  business is to stop it going through
                  illegally. Could you be a little
                  more specific?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  There's a man whose name was mentioned
                  to me a couple of times- Eltenton.
                  I think he's a chemist employed by
                  Shell. He talked to a friend of his
                  who's an acquaintance of someone on
                  the project. To go beyond that would
                  be to put names down of people who
                  are not only innocent but were 100
                  percent cooperative.

                  I was trying to give them Eltenton
                  without opening a can of worms. I
                  told him a cock-and-bull story.

                     wasn't confused before, but I'm

                                 GROVES
                     That he was under the influence of
                     the typical American schoolboy
                     attitude that there's something wicked
                     about telling on a friend. He did
                     what he thought was essential-
                     disclosing Eltenton.

                                 PASH
                     The memo I wrote at the time states
                     'Dr.Oppenheimer sought to provide
                     information to burnish his image as
                     loyal, clearly having heard of our
                     investigation at Berkeley. He is
                     not to be trusted on matters of

                     These other people you mentioned,
                     were they contacted by Eltenton
                     direct?
                                    OPPENHEIMER
                     No.

                     Well now, could we know through whom
                     that contact was made?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     It would involve people who ought
                     not be involved in this.
                                 PASH
                     Is this person a member of the

                     Eltenton made the approach through a
                     member of the faculty here at
                     Berkeley?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     As far as I know- there may have
                     been more than one person involved.
                     If I seem uncooperative I think you
                     can understand that it's because of
                     my insistence in not getting innocent
                     people into trouble.
        Pash stares at me.     I finally keep my mouth shut.

        Bohr holds court.    I listen at the back.
                              BOHR
                  ...showed me the oxygen- of course I
                  messed it up. When they opened me
                  up in Scotland I was unconscious. I
                  pretended I'd been napping.
        The crowd LAUGHS, loving it.     Bohr peels off to talk to me.
                              BOHR (CONT'D)
                  Is it big enough?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  To end the war?
                              BOHR
                  To end all war.
148     INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION - LATER                             148
        I sip my drink, watching Bohr read the boards. Tolman,
        Teller, Bethe and Serber sprawl, party hats, TINSEL scarves...
                              BOHR
                  Heisenberg sought me out in
                  Copenhagen. It was chilling- my old
                  student, working for the Nazis. He
                  told me things to draw me out...
                  sustained fission reactions in
                  Uranium...
                              TOLMAN
                  That sounds more like a reactor than
                  a bomb.
                              TELLER
                  Did he mention gaseous diffusion?
                              BOHR
                  He seemed more focused on heavy water.
                              TELLER
                  As a moderator?
                                 BOHR
                  Yes.     Instead of graphite.
        Serber and Tolman GRIN.     I nod.   Bohr notices us relax...

                     What?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     He took a wrong turn. We're ahead.
                     And with you here to help us...
        Bohr turns to Teller and the others-
                                 BOHR
                     Gentlemen, could you give us a moment?
        They shuffle out.     Bohr looks at the MARBLES.    Turns to me...
                                 BOHR (CONT'D)
                     I'm not here to help, Robert. I
                     knew you could do this without me.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Then why did you come?
                                 BOHR
                     To talk about after. The power you're
                     revealing will forever outlive the
                     Nazis. And the world is not prepared.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     You can lift the rock without being
                     ready for the snake that's revealed.
                                 BOHR
                     We have to make the politicians
                     understand- this isn't a new weapon-
                     it's a new world. I'll be out there,
                     doing what I can- but you...
                         (points at me)
                     You're an American Prometheus- Father
                     of the Atomic Bomb. The man who
                     gave them the power to destroy
                     themselves. They'll respect that.
                     And your work really begins.
        I take this in.      Charlotte Serber enters-
                                 CHARLOTTE
                     I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.
                     From San Francisco.
        I look at my watch, surprised... look at Bohr, who nods 'Go'.

        Kitty, on horseback, finds my horse, tied up. She dismounts,
        moving into the trees... she finds me curled up at the base
        of a tree in the SNOW, distraught.

                     me... but I told her I wouldn't see
                     her again. It was me.
        Kitty SLAPS me in the face.      I look up at her, bleary-eyed...

                     You don't get to commit the sin,
                     then have us all feel sorry for you
                     that it had consequences.

        I vacantly preside over a shambles- the goldfish bowl is

                  Teller's not helping- I've been asking

163     INT. SECRETARY OF WAR'S OFFICE - DAY                           163
        I sit on a couch next to Fermi- Lawrence, Groves and Bush in
        chairs. Secretary of War STIMSON presides. Military,
        Scientists and Officials are scattered through the room.
                              STIMSON
                  The firestorm in Tokyo killed 100
                  thousand people. Mostly civilians.
                  I worry about an America where we do
                  these things and no one protests.
                              MARSHALL
                  Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal
                  conflict in the Pacific buys a lot
                  of latitude with the American public.
                              STIMSON
                  Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?
                              FERMI
                  In truth, the A-bomb might not cause
                  as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.
                              STIMSON
                  What are we estimating?
                              BUSH
                  In a medium-sized city, 20 or 30
                  thousand dead.
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  Don't underestimate the psychological
                  impact of an atomic explosion... a
                  pillar of fire 10 thousand feet tall,
                  deadly neutron effects for a mile in
                  all directions... from One. Single.
                  Device. Dropped from a barely noticed
                  B-29... the atomic bomb will be a
                  terrible revelation of divine power.
        Groves carefully monitors my effect on the room...
                              MARSHALL
                  If that's true it would be definitive.
                  World War II would be over. Our
                  boys would come home.
                              STIMSON
                  This could end the war.
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  This could end all war.   If we retain
                  moral advantage.

        Groves registers the pivot...
                                  STIMSON
                     How so?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     If we use this weapon without
                     informing our allies, they'll see it
                     as a threat and we'll be in an arms
                     race.
                                 MARSHALL
                     How open can we be with the Soviets?
                                 BUSH
                     Secrecy won't stop the Soviets

                                 BUSH
                     You've been misinformed. A Russian
                     bomb is a matter of time.
                                 LAWRENCE
                     To stay ahead, our program has to
                     continue at full pace after the war.

                     Secretary Stimson, if I may. Not
                     all the scientists on the project
                     agree. In fact, this might be a
                     moment to consider other opinions-
                                 GROVES
                     The Manhattan Project's been plagued
                     from the start by certain scientists
                     of doubtful discretion and uncertain
                     loyalty. One of them just tried to
                     get a meeting with the President.
        I say nothing.      Groves looks directly at me.
                                 GROVES (CONT'D)
                     We need them for now, but as soon as
                     is practical, we should sever any
                     such scientists from the program.
                     Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?
        I meet Groves' gaze.      Stay silent... Nod.

                  If a Russian bomb is inevitable,
                  perhaps we should invite their top
                  scientists to Trinity.
                              BYRNES
                  President Truman has no intention of
                  raising expectations that Stalin be
                  included in the atomic project.
                              STIMSON
                  Informing him of our breakthrough,
                  and presenting it as the means to
                  win the war need not make unkeepable
                  promises. But the Potsdam peace
                  conference in July is the last chance
                  for Truman to have that conversation.
                  Can you give us a working bomb by
                  then?
                              GROVES
                  Absolutely. We'll test fire before
                  the conference.

                  And Japan?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  If the test works you'll have two
                  bombs for August.
                              STIMSON
                  Military targets?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  There aren't any big enough.
                              CONANT
                  Perhaps a vital war plant, with
                  workers housed nearby.
                              FERMI
                  Could we issue a warning?   To reduce
                  civilian casualties.
                              AIR FORCE OFFICER
                  They'd send up everything they have
                  against us, and I'd be in that plane.
                              BUSH
                  If we announce it and it fails to go
                  off we'd scupper any chance of
                  Japanese surrender.

                  Is there no way to demonstrate the
                  bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?
                              GROVES
                  We intend to demonstrate it in the
                  most unambiguous terms. Twice.
                  Once to show the weapon's power. A
                  second to show that we can keep going
                  until they surrender.
                              STIMSON
                  We have a list of 12 cities to choose
                  from. Sorry, 11, I've taken Kyoto
                  off the list because of its cultural
                  significance to the Japanese people.
        Stimson senses the unease in the room...
                              STIMSON (CONT'D)
                  Let me make this simple for you,
                  gentlemen. The Japanese will not
                  surrender short of a successful
                  invasion of the home islands. Many
                  lives, American and Japanese, will
                  be lost in that invasion. The use
                  of the atomic bomb against Japanese
                  cities will save lives.

                  south, here. And a further
                  observation point on this hill 20
                  miles away.

        Groves and me, alone.      Rain pelting down outside.
                                 GROVES
                     Three years. Four thousand people.
                     Two billion dollars. If it doesn't
                     go off we're both finished.

                     I put my money on 3 kilotons. Any
                     less, they won't get what it is.

                     What did Fermi mean by 'atmospheric
                     ignition'?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     We had a moment where it looked like
                     the chain reaction from an atomic
                     device might never stop. Setting
                     fire to the atmosphere.

                     Why's Fermi still taking side bets
                     on it?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Call it gallows humor.
        Groves takes this in.      Picks the scab-
                                 GROVES
                     Are we saying there's a chance that
                     when we push that button... we destroy
                     the world?
                                  OPPENHEIMER
                     Nothing in our research over the
                     last three years supports that
                     conclusion except as the most remote
                     possibility.
                                   GROVES
                     How remote?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     The chances are near zero.

        Searchlights settle on the gleaming steel tower. A line of

        to the tower comes on...

                     Watch that needle. If the detonators
                     don't charge, or if the voltage dips
                     below 1 volt, you abort.

        Kitty wrangles the kitchen phone while she feeds our baby
        daughter and young son-
                                   KITTY
                     Sorry.    Yes, Charlotte, go ahead.
                                 CHARLOTTE (over phone)
                     Well, I don't know, he just said to
                     tell you to bring in the sheets.
        Kitty freezes, letting the phone come off her ear...

                     Kitty?    Kitty?
        Kitty smiles, tears forming.      It is done.   FADE OUT.

                     If they detonate it too high in the
                     air, the blast won't be as powerful-
                                 AIR FORCE OFFICER
                     With respect, Dr.Oppenheimer.   We'll
                     take it from here.
        I lose sight of the bomb as THE CRATE IS CLOSED.

        Groves appears at my side, watching the loading...
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?
                                 GROVES
                     'Brief' would be an overstatement.
                     He referred to a powerful new weapon,
                     Stalin said he hoped we'd make good
                     use of it against Japan.
                                  OPPENHEIMER
                     That's it?
                                 GROVES
                     Robert, we've given them an ace.
                     It's for them to play the hand.
        Frustrated, I drop my cigarette and GRIND it out-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     You're aiming for the 6th?
                                 GROVES
                     That's up to the C.O. in the Pacific.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Should I come with you to Washington?
                                  GROVES
                     What for?

                                 TELLER
                     Would the Japanese surrender if they

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Yeah. What the hell does Szilard
                     know about the Japanese?
                         (I look at Teller)

                     Edward, the fact that we built this
                     bomb doesn't give us any more right
                     or responsibility to decide how it's
                     used than anyone else.
                                 TELLER
                     But we're the only people who know
                     about it.

                     I've told Stimson the various opinions
                     of the community.

                     But what's your opinion?
        I watch another truck pull out...
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Once it's used, nuclear war, maybe
                     all war, becomes unthinkable.

        CREAKING OF SEATS and SHUFFLE OF FEET as they REACT, HANDS

        Truman comes from behind his desk to shake my hand-
                                 TRUMAN
                     Dr.Oppenheimer, it's an honor.

                     Mr.President. Secretary Byrnes.
        Byrnes nods, sits.     I take a seat.   Truman leans on the desk.

                     How's it feel to be the most famous
                     man in the world?
        I can't think of an answer.

                     You helped save a lot of American

        Truman laughs.      But I'm not joking.   Truman looks to Byrnes
        for help.
                                 BYRNES
                     Doctor Oppenheimer, if what you say
                     about the Soviets is true, we have
                     to build up Los Alamos, not shut it
                     down.
        I WRING my hands, deeply uncomfortable...

                     Mr.President, I feel that I have
                     blood on my hands.
        Truman looks at me differently. Pulls the crisp white
        handkerchief from his breast pocket and offers it-
                                 TRUMAN
                     You think anyone in Hiroshima or
                     Nagasaki gives a shit who built the
                     bomb? They care who dropped it. I
                     did. Hiroshima isn't about you.

                     how was I supposed to protect him.

                     That was the last straw for Robert's
                     enemies.
                                 SENATE AIDE
                     So he had to lose his security
                     clearance.
                                 STRAUSS
                     And with it, his credibility.
                                 SENATE   AIDE
                     But how could they   do it? He was a
                     war hero- and he'd   already told
                     everyone about his   past...
                                 STRAUSS
                     Borden dredged it all up again.
                                 SENATE AIDE
                     But how could Borden get access to
                     Oppenheimer's F.B.I. file? Could it
                     have been Nichols?
                                 STRAUSS
                     I can't imagine he'd do that. But
                     whoever did unleashed a firestorm
                     that burned a path from the White
                     House right to my desk at the AEC.
                     You see them in there trying to hang
                     Oppenheimer round my neck. I've
                     worked my whole life to get here -
                     the cabinet of the United States of
                     America - and now, in front of the
                     entire country, they want to put me
                     back in my place...a lowly shoe
                     salesman.

                     nearly a mile around was instantly
                     and seriously burned by the heat of

                     lucky, who crawled out of the ruins
                     of their homes only slightly injured.
                     But they died anyway. They died
                     days or weeks later from the radium-
                     like rays emitted in great numbers
                     at the moment of the explosion.

                     to come down to how much influence
                     Borden has been able to exert on

                     Oppenheimer's too slippery for that
                     self-promoting clown. I've talked
                     it over with Hoover- he'll hold

                     a platform, you can't martyr him.
                     We need a systematic destruction of
                     Oppenheimer's credibility so he can
                     never again speak on matters of

                     can get it all in the record...

        Kitty and I sit with Joe Volpe.
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Strauss thinks I should walk away...
                                 VOLPE
                     You could. Your security clearance
                     expires tomorrow. Just let it go.
                                 KITTY
                     You'd be accepting the   charges!
                     You'll lose your job.    Your
                     reputation, your place   in history!
                     We'll lose our house.    Robert, we
                     have to fight.
        I look at Kitty.    Nod.
                                 VOLPE
                     As AEC Counsel, I can't represent
                     you. I'll call Lloyd Garrison.
                                   OPPENHEIMER
                     He's good.
                                   VOLPE
                     The best.    But I have to warn you...
249     INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION - DAY                    249
        I watch Garrison scramble to make notes...

                     This won't be a fair fight.

                     During your interview with Boris
                     Pash in 1943 did you refer to

                                   OPPENHEIMER
                     No.
        Robb consults a paper in his black binder.
                                 ROBB
                     You never said 'a man at the consulate
                     expert in the use of microfilm'?

                                 GARRISON
                     I'd like to know what document Mr.Robb
                     is quoting from, and if we might be
                     furnished with a copy.
                                 ROBB
                     The document is classified.
                                 GARRISON
                     Members of the board, we're now
                     hearing some new account of the
                     interview... shouldn't we get back
                     to first hand information?
                                 ROBB
                     This is first hand.
                                 GARRISON
                     How so?
        Robb looks at Grey.     Who nods.
                                 ROBB
                     There's a recording of the interview.
        Garrison is shocked.     I shake my head.
                                 GARRISON
                     You've let my client sit up here and
                     potentially perjure himself and all
                     this time you had a recording-?
                                 ROBB
                     No one told your client to
                     misrepresent his former answers-
                                 GARRISON
                     Misrepresent? It was 12 years ago!
                         (to the Board)
                     Can we listen to this recording?
                                 ROBB
                     Mr.Garrison, you don't have clearance.
        I SNAP at the absurdity-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     But you're reading it into the
                     transcript!
        Garrison puts a calming hand on my arm-

                  Is this proceeding interested in
                  truth or entrapment? Because if
                  it's truth...
        Garrison points at the BLACK BINDERS in front of them all-
                              GARRISON (CONT'D)
                  Where's the disclosure? Where's the
                  witness list?
                              GRAY
                  Mr.Garrison, this is not a trial- as
                  you're well aware. Evidentiary rules
                  do not apply. We're dealing with
                  national security.
                              GARRISON
                  How does national security prevent
                  the prosecution from providing us a
                  list of witnesses?!
        Gray looks at Garrison, stony-faced.
                              GRAY
                  Perhaps a brief recess is in order.
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  If I may? You gentlemen have my
                  words. If you say it's from a
                  transcript then I'll accept it.
                  I've already explained that I made
                  up a cock-and-bull story.
                              ROBB
                  But not the level of detail. Why
                  would anyone present such an elaborate
                  fiction?
                              OPPENHEIMER
                  Because I was an idiot. I found
                  myself trying to give a tip to the
                  intelligence people, without realizing
                  that when you give a tip you have to
                  offer the whole story. Asked for
                  details, I went off on a false
                  pattern. There was no microfilm, no
                  consular attache. There weren't
                  three or more people involved on the
                  project. There was one person
                  involved. That was me.
                                ROBB
                  Why lie?

                                 RABI
                     I'm Chairman of the General Advisory
                     Committee to the AEC, succeeding
                     Dr.Oppenheimer.
                                 GARRISON
                     And how long have you known

                                   RABI
                     Since 1928.    I know him quite well.
                                 GARRISON
                     Well enough to speak on the bearing
                     of his character, loyalty and
                     associations?
                                 RABI
                     Dr.Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding
                     character, loyal to the United States,
                     to his friends and to the institutions

                     I've examined his security file, and
                     in spite of the associations in there,
                     I do not believe Dr.Oppenheimer is a

                     associations from the past should
                     bar him from continuing as a

                     Dr.Rabi, after the Russian A-bomb
                     test, did Dr.Lawrence come to see
                     you prior to the GAC meeting?
                                 RABI
                     You'd be better off asking him.
                                 ROBB
                     I fully intend to. Did he come to
                     you about the Hydrogen bomb?
                                 RABI
                     Yes. We all felt that after the
                     Russian explosion we had to do
                     something to regain our position.
                                 ROBB
                     So you agreed with those who felt we
                     should launch a program for the Super
                     at that time?

                                 RABI
                     No. There were all kinds of
                     legitimate concerns about the
                     allocation of our resources.

                     Would you say Dr.Oppenheimer was
                     unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?
                                 RABI
                     No. He thought a fusion program
                     would come at the expense of our
                     awfully good fission program.
                                 ROBB
                     But that proved not to be the case?
                                 RABI
                     In the event, both could be done.
                     Los Alamos, which Dr.Oppenheimer
                     founded, rose to the occasion and
                     worked miracles, absolute miracles.
                                 ROBB
                     May I ask one more question? A purely
                     hypothetical question. Suppose this
                     Board should not be satisfied that
                     in his testimony here Dr.Oppenheimer
                     had told the whole truth... what
                     would you say then about whether or
                     not he ought to be cleared?
                                 RABI
                     If you want to set me up on the Board,
                     then I'll give you an answer. But
                     I've never hidden my opinion that I
                     think this whole proceeding is a
                     most unfortunate one.
                                 ROBB
                     Why?
                                 RABI
                     He's a consultant- you don't want to
                     consult the guy? Don't. Why go
                     through all this against a man who's
                     accomplished what Dr.Oppenheimer
                     has? Look at his record- we have an
                     A-bomb and a whole series of it, and
                     we have a whole series of Super bombs
                     and what more do you want, mermaids?

        Strauss watches with satisfaction as Teller testifies.
                              TELLER
                  ...that's why I'm here today. To
                  express the warm support for science
                  and scientists Mr.Strauss has shown
                  over the years I've known him.
                              CHAIRMAN
                  Thank you Dr.Teller. We'll break
                  now, unless there's any immediate
                  business.
                              STRAUSS
                  Senator, I'd like to once again
                  request that we're furnished with a
                  list of witnesses.
                              CHAIRMAN
                  And I'll remind the nominee that we
                  don't always have that information
                  in advance. We do know that Dr.Hill
                  will be here after lunch.
        With that, the Chairman BANGS his gavel...

                  Our next scheduled witness,
                  Dr.Lawrence, has apparently come
                  down with... colitis..,
        I glance sideways at Garrison, who almost smiles-
                              ROBB (CONT'D)
                  So I'll proceed instead with William
                  Borden.
        I watch as Borden is sworn in.
                              ROBB (CONT'D)
                  Mr.Borden, as a result of your study
                  of Dr.Oppenheimer, did you reach
                  certain conclusions?
                                BORDEN
                  I did.

                                 ROBB
                     Did there come a time when you
                     expressed those conclusions in a
                     letter to Mr.J.Edgar Hoover of the
                     Federal Bureau of Investigation?
                                 BORDEN
                     That is correct.
                                 ROBB
                     Prior to writing that letter, did
                     you discuss the writing of it with
                     anybody connected with the Atomic
                     Energy Commission?
                                  BORDEN
                     I did not.
                                 ROBB
                     Do you have a copy of the letter
                     with you?
        Robb's assistant distributes copies of the letter...
                                 BORDEN
                     I have one in front of me.
                                 ROBB
                     Would you be good enough to read it?
                                 GARRISON
                     A moment, please!
        Garrison holds up a finger, FRANTICALLY reading ahead-
                                 GRAY
                     What's the purpose of the delay?
                     He's simply going to read this.
                                 GARRISON
                     Mr.Chairman, this is the first we've
                     seen of this letter- and I see
                     statements, at least one, which I
                     don't think anybody would be happy
                     to have go into the record-
                     accusations that have not before
                     been made and are not part of the
                     indictment from Nichols.
        Garrison holds up the letter-
                                 GARRISON (CONT'D)
                     Is it the opinion of the Board that
                     these are matters into which inquiry
                     should now be directed?

        I scan down the letter for what he's seen.      My face falls...
                              GRAY
                  Testimony of this witness is not in
                  any way going to broaden the inquiry.
                              GARRISON
                  How can it avoid it, sir? Supposing
                  you should believe the witness?
                  Mr.Robb is tasked by this board with
                  calling in witnesses, and he brings
                  in one to make accusations of a kind
                  that I don't think belong here.
                              ROBB
                  Mr.Chairman, the witness wrote this
                  letter on his own initiative laying
                  out evidence which has already been
                  before the board. His conclusions
                  are valid testimony just like the
                  positive conclusions of friends of
                  Dr.Oppenheimer. It cuts both ways.
                              GARRISON
                  How long has Counsel been in
                  possession of the letter?
                              ROBB
                  Mr.Garrison, I don't think I should
                  be subject to cross-examination by
                  you.
                              GRAY
                  Mr.Garrison, given that we on the
                  Board have all read the letter, isn't
                  it better to have it in the record?
        Garrison says nothing.      He looks at me, frustrated.
                              GRAY (CONT'D)

                  probably than not J.Robert Oppenheimer

                  Oppenheimer was a sufficiently
                  hardened Communist that he volunteered
                  information to the Soviets. 2. More
                  probably than not, he has since been
                  functioning as an espionage agent.

                  Dr.Hill would you care to make a

                              HILL
                  Thank you. I have been asked to
                  testify about Lewis Strauss, a man
                  who has given years of service in
                  high positions of Government and who
                  is known to be earnest, hardworking
                  and intelligent.
        Strauss glances at Counsel, satisfied.

                     The views I have to express are my
                     own, but I believe that much I have
                     to say will help indicate why most
                     of the scientists in this country
                     would prefer to see Mr.Strauss
                     completely out of the government.
        Strauss narrows his eyes...
                                 SENATOR PASTORE
                         (friendly lob)
                     You're referring to the hostility of
                     certain scientists directed at
                     Mr.Strauss because of his commitment
                     to security, as demonstrated in the
                     Oppenheimer affair?
                                    HILL
                     No.
        Dr.Hill takes a sip of water before continuing...
                                 HILL (CONT'D)
                     Because of the personal vindictiveness
                     he demonstrated against
                     Dr.Oppenheimer, and against all those
                     who have disagreed with his official
                     positions.
        Counsel turns to Strauss, who is FIXATED on Hill. The Senate
        Aide REACTS, surprised. MURMURS echo through the chamber...
                                 HILL (CONT'D)
                     In my ten years observation of
                     Mr.Strauss I have seen his incapacity
                     to change a position, the
                     subordination of his integrity to
                     the attainment of political goals
                     and an obsessive quest for popular
                     and professional approval...
        The audience REACTS- Strauss SHAKES his head- the Chairman
        BANGS the gavel-

                     It appears to most scientists around
                     the country that Oppenheimer is now
                     being pilloried and put through an
                     ordeal because he expressed his honest
                     opinions. The written charges against
                     him are in a poorly written indictment
                     which the Board should have rejected
                     from the outset.
                                 EVANS
                     Dr.Bush, I thought I was performing
                     a service to my country in hearing
                     this case.
                                 BUSH
                     No Board in this country should sit
                     in judgment of a man because he
                     expressed strong opinions. If you
                     want to try that case, you can try
                     me- I have expressed strong opinions,
                     often unpopular, many times. I'm
                     doing so right now. When a man is
                     pilloried for doing that, this country
                     is in a severe state... excuse me,
                     gentlemen, if I become stirred, but
                     I am.
                                                                 CUT TO:

        Strauss fumes as Hill reads his statement.
                                 HILL
                     From the standpoint of public welfare,
                     the most injurious exercise of
                     personal vindictiveness in which
                     Lewis Strauss has engaged was in the
                     personnel security prosecution of
                     J.Robert Oppenheimer, who had not
                     hesitated to disagree with Mr.Strauss
                     on certain questions of fundamental
                     policy. Oppenheimer made mincemeat
                     out of Strauss' position on the
                     shipments of isotopes to Norway, and
                     Strauss never forgave him this public
                     humiliation. Another controversy
                     between them centered around their
                     differences in judgment on how the H-
                     bomb would contribute to national
                     security.

                     Oppenheimer had considerable influence
                     and prestige, and Strauss was able
                     to find a few ambitious men who also
                     disagreed with Oppenheimer's position,
                     and envied him his prestige in
                     government circles.
        Teller, in the audience, stares at Hill...
                                 HILL (CONT'D)
                     Strauss turned to the personnel
                     security system in order to destroy
                     Oppenheimer's effectiveness-
                                 SENATOR PASTORE
                     But, Doctor Hill, we've already heard
                     that Mr.Strauss did not bring the
                     charges, or participate in the
                     hearings against Dr.Oppenheimer.
                                 HILL
                     I realize that Mr.Strauss didn't
                     sign the letter of charges, but I
                     think when all of the evidence is
                     viewed, it becomes highly plausible
                     that the Oppenheimer matter was
                     initiated and carried through largely
                     through the animus of Lewis Strauss.
                                                                 CUT TO:

                     Under my interpretation of the Atomic
                     Energy Act, which did not exist when
                     I hired Dr.Oppenheimer in 1942... I
                     would not clear Dr.Oppenheimer today
                     if I were a member of the commission.

                     General, Dr.Oppenheimer had no
                     responsibility for the selection or

                  You wouldn't want to leave with this
                  board even the remotest suggestion
                  that you're here questioning
                  Dr.Oppenheimer's basic loyalty to
                  the United States in the operation
                  of Los Alamos?
                              GROVES
                  By no means. I hope I didn't lead
                  anybody to think otherwise for an
                  instant.
                              GARRISON
                  Would you say that the revocation of
                  Dr.Oppenheimer's position would be
                  in the public interest?
                              GROVES
                  The revocation under such extreme
                  publicity I think would be most
                  unfortunate, not because of the effect
                  on Dr.Oppenheimer- that I leave to
                  one side- but because of the
                  disastrous effect upon the attitude
                  of the scientists of this country
                  toward doing government research.

                  of a rather ingenious legal background
                  to try to trick Oppenheimer into

                  succeed in a few instances.

                    Can a distinction be made between

                    In the days when I was a member I
                    thought they were definitely two
                    things-
        Garrison and I hang on her every word...
                                KITTY (CONT'D)
                    I thought the Communist party of the
                    United States was concerned with our
                    domestic problems. I now no longer
                    believe this. I believe the whole
                    thing is linked together and spread
                    all over the world.

                  Were you familiar with the fact that
                  your husband was making contributions
                  to the Spanish Civil War as late as

                  I knew that Robert gave money from
                  time to time, yes.

                  Do you remember whether he gave money

                  Would it be fair to say that this
                  meant that by 1942 he had not stopped
                  having anything to do with the
                  Communist party? I don't insist

                  I know that. Thank you. But the

                  anything to do with the Communist
                  Party' because Robert never had
                  anything to do with the Communist
                  Party as such. I know he gave money
                  for Spanish Refugees. I know he
                  took an intellectual interest in

        I watch Teller testify.
                              ROBB
                  Is it your intention to suggest that
                  Dr.Oppenheimer is disloyal to the
                  United States?
                              TELLER
                  I do not want to suggest anything of
                  the kind. I have always assumed,
                  and now assume, that he is loyal to
                  the United States. I believe this,
                  and I shall believe it until I see
                  very conclusive proof to the opposite.
                              ROBB
                  Now, a question which is a corollary
                  of that... do you or do you not
                  believe that Dr.Oppenheimer is a
                  security risk?
                              TELLER
                  In a great number of cases I have
                  seen Dr.Oppenheimer act in a way
                  which for me was exceedingly hard to
                  understand. I thoroughly disagreed
                  with him in numerous issues, and his
                  actions, frankly, appeared to me
                  confused and complicated. To this
                  extent, I feel that I would like to
                  see the vital interests of this
                  country in hands which I understand
                  better and therefore trust more.

                     they'd get a say in how we used their

        I am back at the witness table.     Robb squares up.
                                 ROBB
                     Doctor, in your work on the Hydrogen
                     bomb at Los Alamos and in the years
                     following, were you deterred by any
                     moral qualms about the development
                     of this weapon?
                                  OPPENHEIMER
                     Of course.
                                 ROBB
                     But you still got on with the work,
                     didn't you?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Yes, because this was work of
                     exploration. It was not the
                     preparation of a weapon.
                                 ROBB
                     You mean it was just an academic
                     excursion?

                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     No. It's not an academic thing
                     whether you can make a Hydrogen bomb.
                     It's a matter of life and death.
                                 ROBB
                     Beginning in 1942 you were actively
                     pushing the development of the H-
                     bomb, weren't you?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     Pushing is not the right word.
                     Supporting and working on it, yes.
                                 ROBB
                     When did these moral qualms become
                     so strong that you opposed the
                     development of the Hydrogen bomb?
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     When it was suggested that it be the
                     policy of the United States to make
                     these things at all costs, without
                     regard to the balance between these
                     weapons and atomic weapons as part
                     of our arsenal.
                                 ROBB
                         (theatrical confusion)
                     What did moral qualms have to do
                     with that?

                     Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic
                     bomb. He wanted to be the man who
                     moved the earth. He talks about
                     putting the nuclear genie back in
                     the bottle- well, I'm here to tell
                     you that I know J.Robert Oppenheimer
                     and if he could do it all over he'd
                     do it all the same.

                     He's never once said he regrets
                     Hiroshima- he'd do it all over because
                     it made him the most important man

        I struggle to find an answer for Robb...
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     We freely used the atomic bomb.
                                 ROBB
                     In fact, Doctor, you assisted in
                     selecting the target for the drop of
                     the atomic bomb on Japan?
        Now I can hear the sound of FEET STAMPING...
                                  OPPENHEIMER
                     Yes.
                                 ROBB
                     You knew, did you not, that the
                     dropping of that atomic bomb on the
                     target you had selected would kill
                     or injure thousands of civilians, is
                     that correct?
                                 OPPENHEIMER

                     70,000?   At both Hiroshima and-
                                 OPPENHEIMER
                     110,000 at both.

                     test said that a Super bomb should
                     never be produced, did it not?

                     What we meant- what I meant- was
                     that it would be a better world if
                     there were no Hydrogen bombs in it.

                     Wouldn't the Soviets do anything to
                     increase their military strength?

                     If we did it, they'd have to do it.
                     Our efforts would fuel their efforts-
                     just as it had with the atomic bomb!

                       (gentle)
                   Dr.Oppenheimer, when did your strong
                   moral convictions develop with respect
                   to the Hydrogen bomb?
        I open my eyes, exhausted...

                   When it became clear to me that we
                   would tend to use any weapon we had.

                               STRAUSS
                   J.Robert Oppenheimer- the martyr. I
                   gave him exactly what he wanted. To
                   be remembered for Trinity, not
                   Hiroshima, not Nagasaki. He should
                   be thanking me.
                               SENATE AIDE
                   Well, he's not.
        Strauss looks at the Senate Aide's neck, wondering if he
        could get one hand all the way around it. Speaking softly-
                               STRAUSS
                   Do you still have enough votes, or
                   is the crowning moment of my career
                   about to become the most public
                   humiliation of my life?
        The Senate Aide looks down at his buck slip, counts his tally.

                     many of your current and former
                     colleagues has come to the unanimous
                     conclusion that you are a loyal

                     your continuing associations and
                     disregard for the security apparatus
                     of this country, together with your
                     somewhat disturbing conduct in
                     relation to the Hydrogen bomb and

                     certain of your responses to this

        We hear the press gathering behind the doors. Strauss checks
        his tie in the mirror. Smooths his hair. The Senate Aide
        enters, buck slip in hand.
                                 STRAUSS
                     Is it official?
                                 SENATE AIDE
                     I'm afraid there were a couple of
                     unexpected holdouts.
        Strauss freezes, absorbing the impact.

                  guy, trying to make a name for
                  himself. Didn't like what you did

                  I did what was right for this country.
                  They don't want me in the cabinet
                  room? Maybe they should just invite
                  Oppenheimer instead.
                              SENATE AIDE
                  Perhaps they will.

                     other that day, is it possible they

                     You once had a reception for me at
