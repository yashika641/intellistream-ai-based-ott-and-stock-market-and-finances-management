    A woman stands on a bridge on a foggy day. She dives off.

    LONDON 1882 BELLA BAXTER, a young woman around 30, sits
    calmly erect at the piano.
    She raises her hands and then smashes down on all the keys
    with her fists in a joyful way, screeching with laughter as
    she does.
    Baxter 50s, in a suit and cravat, deformed face, probably a
    result from medical experiments, smiles watching. The
    kindness of his eyes is evident despite his scary face.

    Baxter is hooked up to a machine and a tube flows into and
    under his waistcoat into his stomach. The glass machine pumps
    saliva like fluid.
    He and Bella eat. Mrs Prim, the housekeeper, puts kippers
    down. Bella grabs one, eats it, makes a face, spits it back
    across the table.
    Baxter makes a sound. A giant bubble spills forth from his
    mouth.
    It floats a second, they watch as it lands and evaporates.
    Bella laughs, claps. Baxter smiles.
    He gets up, detaches the pipe from his innards and goes
    behind her. Kisses her on the head.

    Baxter puts on his coat and hat. Bella runs along the hall to
    him. She has a half dog, half pig following her.
                        BAXTER
              Bye.
                        BELLA
              Ba. Ba.
    He goes out. Locking the door behind him.

5   INT MEDICAL SCHOOL LECTURE THEATRE LONDON DAY                 5
    A pile of organs on a silver tray. A bunch of small animal
    cadavers lie nearby.
    An audience of medical students, staring.
    Baxter, his smock drenched in blood, addresses them.
    A human cadaver, slit open and empty of organs, lies before
    him.
                        BAXTER
              A pile of organs without the spark
              of self from a brain or the pump of
              blood from a heart. Just a
              butcher's tray for a Sunday lunch.
              Now who would like to reconstruct
              the organs? And who can tell human
              from animal? If there is a
              difference. Come come! You did
              puzzles as children, did you not?
    They all stare at him. A young guy in his late twenties, Max
    McCandles watches. He is eager, righteous and badly dressed.
    Some posh fops sit in front of him.
                        FOP 1
              Is it just me or is it devilishly
              hard to concentrate when the
              monster's talking?
                        MAX
              He is an extraordinary surgeon, his
              father founded this place. His
              research is said to be
              groundbreaking.
                        FOP 2
              Have you mistaken yourself as
              included in this conversation Max
              McCandles? Your physical proximity
              to us does not make it so.
                        MAX
              I-
                        GUY
              Fuck off old pal. Get yourself a
              suit.
    Max shrinks back. He watches as a hapless student at the
    front of the room tries to reassemble the organs in place.
                        BAXTER
              You really think that is where the
              liver goes sir?

                        FOP 1
              May I ask what is the purpose of
              putting them back in sir?
    Baxter looks up. Considers him.
                        BAXTER
              My amusement. Mr Max McCandles!
    Everyone is startled.
                        BAXTER (CONT'D)
              Walk with me at the end of the
              lesson.

    Max is staring at a portrait of a very serious looking man,
    handsome, in a suit. "Barret Baxter. Our founder. 1842."
    Baxter appears and passes right by him walking in a quick
    pace. Max struggles to keep up.

                        BAXTER
              Your paper.

                        MAX
              You liked it sir?

                        BAXTER
              It showed signs of a conventional
              mind straining hard to almost touch
              mediocrity.

                        MAX
              ...Thank you.

                        BAXTER
              I need someone. An assistant on a
              project.
                          MAX
              I would-

                        BAXTER
              Are you a religious man?

                        MAX
              I believe in God.

                        BAXTER
              Me or the deity?

                        MAX
              Humorous I see, because you are
              known as...
                       Poor Things - Final Cut                  4.


                        BAXTER
              It is a joke of my own making, I do
              not need it explicated for me.

7   EXT LONDON STREET - DAY                                          7
    They enter the street. A little kid laughs at Baxter. The
    kid's mother pulls at the kid, curling her face up at Baxter.
                        WOMAN
              The very devil's work.
                         MAX
              Have you ever thought of growing a
              beard sir?
                        BAXTER
              I look like a big dog in a cravat.
                        MAX
              Kids like dogs. This job.
                           BAXTER
              Yes. Come.
    They arrive at Baxter's house.

8   INT BAXTER'S HOUSE DINING ROOM - DAY                             8
    Bella stares at the table, laid for dinner with plates and
    glasses. She holds a plate examining it. Happily drops it, it
    smashes on the floor.
    She starts dropping one after another. Tosses one at the wall
    gleefully.
    Max and Baxter arrive, unseen at the door. Baxter nods at
    Max. He watches. She senses him.
                           BELLA
              God!
    She runs to him and leaps. He catches her. She is round his
    waist.
                        BELLA (CONT'D)
              He... He...

                           BAXTER
              Hello.

                           BELLA
              Lo.

                        BAXTER
              This is Mr McCandles.
                   Poor Things - Final Cut                  5.


                    MAX
          Hello Bella.
He puts his hand out to shake hers. She raises a hand gently,
then swats him in the nose with a palm. Laughs
uncontrollably. His nose starts to bleed.
                    BELLA
          Bood, Bood.
                    BAXTER
          Blood. Blood.
                    BELLA
          Blood.
                    BAXTER
          Marvellous.
                    MAX
          I'm fine. I'm fine.
Bella starts walking around and around in a circle. Until
she's dizzy. Max stares at her.
                    MAX (CONT'D)
          What a very pretty retard.

Bella still spinning on the other side of the room. Baxter
whispers to Max.

                    BAXTER
          She suffered a brain injury, I
          repaired it. Her mental age and her
          body are not quite synchronised.
          Language is coming. She is
          progressing at an accelerated pace.

                    MAX
          She is ...stunning.
                    BAXTER
          I need to meticulously note her
          progression. You will do this for
          me.

                    MAX
          It would be my honor.

Bella stops spinning.

                    BELLA
          Weeeee Weee.

                    BAXTER
          Yes it is exciting Bella.

               Nah. Wee.
     A wet patch appears across her dress.
                         MAX
               Wee. She's doing a-

     Bella lies in a beautiful bed in a beautiful room. She wakes
     up. Prim and Max enter. Max holds a notebook. He notes down
     the time.

     Max takes notes as Bella eats eggs and kippers. Bella stops
     chewing. Opens her mouth drops the chewed up food out of her
     mouth onto the table. Goes on eating her eggs.
                         MAX
               Do you not like kippers?
     She points to him questioningly.
                         MAX (CONT'D)
               I am partial to them actu-

     She scoops it up off the table, throws the chewed up fish at
     him. Laughs.

     Baxter, in a mask, a body on a slab. Mrs Prim is there
     working the anaesthetic.

     Bella sits on a bench watching, fascinated by the scene, gets
     up, leans in close as the body is shaved so it can be cut.
     The knife on the skin. The scalpel slices an incision, she
     looks up at Baxter beaming.

                         BELLA
               Bella cut too?

                         BAXTER
               Just dead ones for Bella.

                            BELLA
               Just dead.
                        Poor Things - Final Cut                7.


     She walks over to a section of the room where a couple of
     cadavers lay out. She runs a hand over one, pushes at it's
     breast. Holds a penis up. Lets it fall. She takes a scalpel
     walks to the head. Starts plunging it into the eyeballs of a
     cadaver. Much to Max's horror and her delight.
                          BELLA (CONT'D)
                Squish. Squish.

     barking like a dog.
                          BELLA
                Chog! Chog! Run Chog!

     Max looks at the animal, startled.

     Bella feeds a collection of animals. Pig/dogs. Duck/lambs.
     Max stares at them wide eyed.

     He eyes the filing cabinets stuffed with medical files.

     Max sits opposite Baxter, who is looking through Max's notes.

                          MAX
                She gathers 15 words a day. Her
                coordination seems unstable at
                best. Her hair grows an inch every
                two days.
                          BAXTER
                Excellent. You may go. See you
                tomorrow.

                          MAX
                Where did she come from?

                          BAXTER
                I believe your job is to collect
                data. When I add inane questions to
                it I'll let you know.

     He nods.

     Baxter reads to Bella from a book, she blithely lays flat on
     top of him on her bed.
                         BAXTER
               And so when they returned from the
               wood she was reunited with her
               mummy and daddy. That night for
               dinner they ate cake until they
               were sick, they were so happy to be
               back together. The next day when
               she awoke..

               Prim say you not be? Who is?
     Baxter looks down at his book for an answer. The next story.
     `Adventure in the Andes', an illustration of a man and woman
     in explorer gear.
                         BAXTER
               You are an orphan. Your parents
               died.
                         BELLA
               Then you cut parents up God?
                         BAXTER
               No. They were... my friends, they
               were brave explorers and were
               killed in a landslide in South
               America. They pushed the boundaries
               of what was known and paid a price.
               But there is no other way to live
               Bella. They sent you to me to care
               for you.
                         BELLA
               Dead.

                         BELLA
               Poor Bella. But love God.
     She embraces him. He squirms a bit, awkward, pleasure. Drinks
     in her smell a bit.

               No.

     He rolls her off him.

     He watches Bella take a nut from a bowl full and eat it. He
     notes it.

                         BELLA
               Why you pen book every nut.

                         MAX
               To note down your nutritional
               intake.

     She picks up a huge handful shoves them in her mouth, they
     spill out as well.

     follows her, nervously shuffling his way across on hands and
     knees. Sees the back of her head and the looping scar
     underneath her hair.

     She leans out and looks across the suburb, parks, houses,
     carriages. Takes her breath away.

     Bella picks up a piece of loose shingle. Drops it over the
     side. Max startled, looks down as it shatters on the road.
     Bella laughs. Seems to decide something. Strolls back across

     Sees a man selling ice cream at the exit to the park. People

     at the window.

     Baxter pulls her down from the window. He sees through the
     gap in the blinds people looking at them. She bites his hand.
     He releases her. She opens the door. Max, not knowing what
     else to do, pulls her back inside, ripping her blouse as he

     They pull her blankets over her. And exit.

               away with one Duncan Wedderburn.

                           BAXTER
               What!?

                         BELLA
               You will wish to stop me.

                         BAXTER
               I shall stop you!
                         BELLA
               You hold Bella too tight. I must
               set forth into waters.
                         BAXTER
               We can travel. You, me, and Max.
               Whom, I will remind you, you are
               betrothed to.
                         BELLA
               I will marry Max as he seems right
               for that, but first I will
               adventure on Duncan Wedderburn,
               whom I think cares little of damage
               to me, but will be interesting as
               well.
                         BAXTER
               I can't let you go.
                          BELLA
               Kiss me and set me forth. If you do
               not, Bella's insides turn rotten
               with hate.
                          BAXTER
               Hate?

     raging clip.
                         MAX
               Unpack those bags Prim.
     Prim walks out past him. Rolls her eyes.

               Godwin has explained your plan. I
               do not blame you Bella, that man is
               a cad and a rake. He has insidious
               ways to get under a naive woman's

          softly between Bella's legs and

Beat. Max stares at her.

          Jesus! We are engaged Bella. I love
          you.
                    BELLA
          And when I am back we marriage and
          be happy as two doves on a branch.
          You think I need travel hat?
                    MAX
          This will not do. It cannot.
He starts taking off his coat.
                    MAX (CONT'D)
          I will see to this man myself, beat
          him until his handsome face is a
          porridge of blood and bones.

                    BELLA
          Max you are flushed and I am too at
          sight of different Max.

                    MAX
          I apologise but I will not let
          someone I know who has nothing but
          ill intent in his mind and nothing
          for you in his heart, trick you. I
          will smash his fucking head in.

She crushes her lips on his. Pulls away and brings a cloth
with chloroform to his mouth. An unconscious Max drops to the
floor.
                    BELLA
          Good bye later dove. I will see you
          after grand adventure.

Baxter comes in clutching a stack of folded notes.

Baxter grabs a dress from her case, rips open the lining, and
swiftly sews the money into the dress with the skill of a
surgeon. She watches him. He stares at her as he does it.

He comes to her, embraces her, then stalks from the room.

               I am having port for breakfast. It
               is strangely delicious.
     He turns and sees Baxter lying on the floor, an almost empty
     flagon beside him.
                         MAX
               She's gone. Why did you not stop

               She is now out there. Alone.

               She will be fine.
                         MAX
               I am a fool. I should've stopped
               her.

               Sssh, we are men of science, this
               emotionality is unseemly.
     Max lies down next to him. Takes a glass. Baxter pours for
     him. They lie there.

               I just hope she's alright.

               You're behavior is unconscionable.

               baby annoying, and the woman boring
               with words.

     He pushes her hard into the wall, grabs her arm twists her
     wrist. She winces. Surprised.

                         DUNCAN
               You will rejoin the table and will
               confine yourself to the following
               three phrases. `How marvellous'.
               `Delighted'. `And how do they get
               the pastry so crisp?' Yes?

                         BELLA
               You are hurting Bella.

               I'm sorry. Reason does not
               penetrate!

     A listless Max and Baxter at the table. Breakfast laid before
     them. Baxter suddenly releases a bubble into the air. They
     watch it float and die.

     Prim comes in with mail. Baxter eyes it, bored. He sees
     something.

     They look at the naive but stunning drawings on the card.
     Sexual drawings, espresso cups. A tram coming out of her
     mouth. Scrawled babyish writing over it. They try and

     Duncan sits with Bella. He is sullen. The waiter stands as
     Bella orders..

     She points to an old couple dining nearby. Looks at Duncan.

                           DUNCAN
               Right.   I have become the thing I
               hated,   the grasping succubus of a
               lover.   I have pried many of them
               off me   and now I am it. Fuck!
     She gets up, walks onto the dance floor, does a dance of her
     own making, alone.

People are weirded out. He watches her. Crazy with love. Goes
and joins her. Takes her in his arms tries to dance normally
with her but she has no idea how and they stumble there way
across the floor. And to their seats.
                    DUNCAN (CONT'D)
          You, like me, are a creature of
          freedom and the moment!

She winks. He looks at her.

                    DUNCAN (CONT'D)
          What are you doing that for?

                    BELLA
          A man over there repeated blinks at
          me. I blink back, for polites I
          think.

Duncan turns and looks at the guy, who looks away. Duncan
crosses the room and attacks the guy. He smashes the guy in
the eye with a glass. They wrestle.

Bella watches for a moment. A man and woman come up to her.

                    DANCING WOMAN
          We are going to dance in town,
          please join us.

                    BELLA
          Oh. I have never danced in town.

She leaves Duncan fighting.

Bella walks across the room with the woman and man. He sees
them, extricates himself. Attacks them. The guy and Duncan
exchange punches.

Bella attacks the guy as well. Duncan looks at her.

                    DUNCAN
          You are quite mad.

                    BELLA

          I will not stop talking if I have
          something to...

Bella picks up someones drink off a table and throws it in
his face, glass and drink.

     They stare at each other. Bella jumps, her legs around him.
     She pushes him down. He slides down, smiles at her
     lasciviously. Lifts her dress up, then stops.
                         DUNCAN
               What's this?
     She has the word `soft' written on one inner thigh, `softer'
     on the other one.
                         BELLA
               A man was teaching me chess when he
               said he thought I probably would
               have the softest skin he had ever
               touched. I said if I did it would
               be the inner thighs to test, for
               that is where the epidermis is at
               its most fine.
     He looks at her.
                          BELLA (CONT'D)
               So we tested, and it was the
               softest ever! And I noted perhaps
               they were not equal in softitude.
               Indeed they were not. So I made
               sure to note it, remembering which
               was which.

     He stares at her.

     He gets up. Walks out of the room.

                          BELLA (CONT'D)
               What of the tongue play you were
               about to perform? Is that not

     Wedderburn walks to the bar, motions for liquor. Smacks his
     head hard into the counter of the bar. Makes a guttural yell.

     Blood runs from his head as he drinks the shot. Bella joins
     him.

                         BELLA
               You are troubled?

                         DUNCAN

               No, he just fastlicked at my
               clitoris. I had the heat that
               needed release. So at my requesting
               it was.
     He hits his head on the bar again.
                         BELLA (CONT'D)
               You too may tongue play me, so am
               not understanding this complicated
               feeling you have... Are you now
               crying?

     He bangs on the door. She ignores him.

82   INT CABIN - NIGHT                                           82
     Bella opens the door into the room. Duncan is asleep on the
     bed. Bella comes out, eyes him. Goes to the door.

83   EXT SHIP -   NIGHT                                          83
     Bella walks through empty ballrooms, empty bars, empty decks.
     Seemingly almost alone on the ship.
     She steps through some doors. Out onto the deck. Sees a
     steward. He holds a seabird by the legs, it flaps it's wings.
     He smashes it against the railing.
                         STEWARD
               Shit on me, you fucker!
     She stands there, he turns to her, the bleeding dead bird in
     his hand.
                           STEWARD (CONT'D)
               Madam.

                         BELLA
               When do we stop?

                         STEWARD
               Athens. Three days.

     She nods. She stares at the bird. He flings it over the
     railing. Smiles at her.

84   INT DINING ROOM - DAY                                       84

     A flamb� crepe suzette, a women's hair on fire. Duncan stares
     at Bella who ignores it, she is drawing a postcard to Baxter.
     Her floating at sea, a bird sitting on her chest pushing her
     under.

                         DUNCAN
               There is a woman on fire. Look.

     She continues drawing.

                         DUNCAN (CONT'D)
               I know you are mad, forgive me my
               kidnapping you, but it was for
               love. A romantic jape. Don't be
               such a cunt about it.

     She looks at him.

                         BELLA
               I want a drink.

                    DUNCAN
          Of course darling. The ship is fun,
          a world to explore. I love you.
          Do you love me?
                    BELLA
          Describe the elements I should be
          looking for within myself to be
          sure.
                    DUNCAN
          You just feel it or not!
                    BELLA
          So it is no evidence base as God
          would say. And so how judge it
          empirically?
                    DUNCAN
          What the fuck are you talking
          about? Who are you? You don't know
          what bananas are, you've never
          heard of chess, and yet you know
          what empirically means!
                    BELLA
          Bella needs a drink. Said twice
          now.
                    DUNCAN
          I have never felt anything like
          this. Is this true for you?
                    BELLA
          ...I suppose empirically it is. Oh
          I am out of ink.
                    DUNCAN
          Then you shall have ink my love.
He gets up and heads across the room.
She looks around the room. Sees a striking woman and a
slightly eccentric style for the era who watches the room,
MARTHA VON KURTZROC. She sits with HARRY ASTLEY, thirties,
American, well dressed reading a newspaper. Bella is
intrigued gets up and walks to her.
                    BELLA
          Hello interesting older lady, I
          must touch your hair.
                    MARTHA
          I noticed your hair as well. Like
          silk on a translucent glowing egg.

                    BELLA
          That is fancy words that excite me
          somehow.
                    MARTHA
          You are with handsome over there,
          all white teeth and hard cock.
                    BELLA
          Duncan Wedderburn. His teeth are
          also hard, his penis is also white.
Harry laughs wryly. Stares at her, suddenly interested.
                    MARTHA
          A good lay I hope.
                     BELLA
          He is my only but I find him able
          to elicit exceptional sensations
          through my whole body and leave me
          yelping happily. I also wish to
          dash his body, form, cadaver into
          the sea. Is this man jumping on
          your body?
                    MARTHA
          He is not. I have not been bedded
          in twenty years.
                    BELLA
          What? That is terrible.
                    MARTHA
          It does not concern me greatly. As
          the years pass what is between my
          ears is my main concern, that
          between my legs less so.
                    HARRY
          A desperate rationalization Martha.
Bella looks at him.
                    MARTHA
          This is Mr. Harry Astley. Try not
          to take what he says to heart. He
          is a cynic.
                       ASTLEY
          Madam.
                    BELLA
          I am Bella Baxter. And don't know
          this cynic is?
Duncan approaches carrying an ink well.

                    DUNCAN
          Bella? Ink.
                    BELLA
          Duncan Wedderburn, I have made
          friends, colleagues, comrades.
                    ASTLEY
          Harry Astley.
                     BELLA
          This is Martha. She is my new
          friend who has not been fucked in
          twenty years! Is that not
          astonishment?!
              (To Martha)
          I hope you use your hand between
          your legs to keep yourself happy?
                     DUNCAN
          Jesus God Bella! You cannot speak
          like this.
                    BELLA
          Polites of society. I forgot.
                    HARRY
          Polite society will destroy you.
                      BELLA
          It will?
                    DUNCAN
          There is some truth to that.
                    MARTHA
          We are all agreed on that. And in
          answer to your enquiry on my hand.
          Occasionally. Yes.
                    BELLA
          That is much reassuring news. We
          shall all dine together.
                    DUNCAN
          We actually-
                    BELLA
          Are all on a ship and cannot
          escape, but there is a world to
          discover, enjoy, traverse,
          circumnavigate.
                    HARRY
          Or can she not have friends Mr
          Wedderburn?
He eyes Harry, smiles.

     Bella and Duncan walk down the hall, him simmering. He stops
     suddenly, pushes her against the wall.
                            DUNCAN
               Marry me.
                            BELLA
               What?
                         DUNCAN
               I meant to throw you aside. A few
               months and then send you packing,
               but I cannot. Say you will marry
               me. No one has ever captured my
               heart. You have.
                         BELLA
               It is tricky as I am engaged to Mr
               Max McCandles.
                            DUNCAN
               What?!
                         BELLA
               My hand has taken by another. It is
               a saying I heard and did not
               understand, you do not take just
               the hand but all, do you not?
                         DUNCAN
               You ran away with me! From him!
                         BELLA
               A recounting of events the point of
               which is elusive to me.
                         DUNCAN
               You chose me! Over him!
                         BELLA
               For now. For fun.
                         DUNCAN
               I will fucking throw you overboard!
                         BELLA
               So you wish to marry me, or kill
               me? Is that the proposal?
                         DUNCAN
               No. No. I...
               I am going to the casino.

86   EXT LONDON PARK - DAY                                     86
     Felicity, a young woman, childlike in manner, is hit in the
     head by a ball thrown by Max.
                         BAXTER
               That's fine.
                         MAX
               She is coming along.
                         BAXTER
               Let's try again. Gross motor skills
               develop slowly but you will
               progress fast.
                            MAX
               Felicity.
     Max throws the ball. Felicity does not reach to catch it and
     it hits her in the head.
                         BAXTER
               Not that fast.
     Felicity starts sobbing uncontrollably.

87   EXT SHIP DECK    -   DAY                                  87
     Bella sits in the sun reading with Martha and Astley. A small
     stack of books beside her.
                         BELLA
               I am reading Emerson. He speaks of
               self improvement of men. I don't
               know why he does not give advice to
               women, perhaps he does not know
               any.
                         MARTHA
               You should also try Goethe.
                         HARRY
               Philosophy is a waste of time
               Bella.
                         BELLA
               Really? Say more.
                         MARTHA
               No, no, Harry you wretch, it is
               integral. People and society can be
               improved.
                     Poor Things - Final Cut            50.


                    BELLA
          It is the goal of all to improve,
          advance, progress and grow. I know
          this in me and am sure I am
          indicative of all.
                    HARRY
          Trust me you are definitely unique
          Bella in all ways. But this
          improvement through philosophy is
          people trying to run away from the
          fact we are cruel beasts. Born that
          way, die that way.
                    BELLA
          It is a dark view of things Harry.
Duncan approaches.
                    DUNCAN
          Bella, let us take the air, `in our
          cabin'?
He winks at her.
                    BELLA
          These two are fighting and ideas
          are banging around Bella's head and
          heart like lights in a storm.
                    DUNCAN
          You are always reading now Bella.
          You are losing some of your
          adorable way of speaking.
                    BELLA
          I am a changingable feast, as are
          all of we. Apparently according to
          Emerson, disagreed with by Harry.
                    DUNCAN
          Come. Come. Just come.
                    BELLA
          You are in my sun.
                      DUNCAN
          What?
She continues reading. He grabs the book out of her hands,
tosses it over the side. Martha hands her one. She starts
reading that. Duncan grabs it and throws it over the side.
He stalks off.

     Duncan playing cards, he is not winning, slightly distracted.
     She comes to him, puts her hand on his shoulder.
                            BELLA
               Come.
     He looks at her.
                         DUNCAN
               I am busy losing. Heavily.
               And busy drinking. Heavily.
     He turns back to his cards, Bella turns and walks out.

89   INT CABIN - NIGHT                                           89
     Bella is lying on the bed reading. Duncan starts kissing her
     feet. She pushes him away.
                         BELLA
               I must meet Martha.
                         DUNCAN
               Martha! She is the problem! I will
               throw that fucking perfumed bag of
               flesh overboard.
     Bella looks at him.
                         BELLA
               I dare you.
     He stares at her. He heads out suddenly.

90   EXT SHIP DECK - DAY                                         90
     Martha sits in a deckchair reading. Duncan arrives at
     speed, Harry is at the railing, sees him coming. Advances
     toward him.
                         HARRY
               Where you going?
                         DUNCAN
               She's going over the side.
                         MARTHA
               Marvellous. I never imagined I'd be
               murdered. How dramatic.
                         HARRY
               She seems happy to die. Sorry for
               getting in your way.
                         Poor Things - Final Cut             52.


     He pushes past Harry straight at Martha.
     Duncan struggles to drag Martha in her deck chair to the
     railings. Two stewards attempt to restrain him. Martha hits
     Duncan in the throat with her cane.
     Bella stands nearby roaring with laughter. The two stewards
     drag Duncan away.
                         DUNCAN
                   (croaks)
               I'll be in the bar.

91   INT CABIN - NIGHT                                            91
     Duncan sleeps, battered and bruised. Bella beside him. She
     can't sleep.

92   INT/EXT HARRY'S CABIN - NIGHT                                92
     Bella walks the cabin hallway. Knocks on Astley's door. He
     answers blearily.
                         BELLA
               You have made me think, cogitate
               and perambulate through ideas that
               are wrong, erroneous and
               nonsensically annoying that lead me
               not to sleep.
                          HARRY
               So...
                         BELLA
               You say all are cruel and I
               disagree, disavow and say no not,
               but when with Duncan the cruel just
               bubbles up in me.
                         HARRY
               That shows good judgement. He is a

                         BELLA
               No. I wish not to be cruel, I must
               improve this aspect of myself.

               You don't know the world. And you
               fear it.

               I don't fear it.

               is really like? I'll show you.

               Yes. Of course!

97   INT ALEXANDRIA HOTEL   -   DAY                               97
     Harry and Bella take breakfast on the balcony of the hotel
     above the garden. Bella hears distant wailing.
                         HARRY
               Can you hear that?
                         BELLA
               What is it?
     He motions she follow him, they follow the sound. She walks
     to the end of the balcony, steps up onto step of the balcony
     so she can peer over the walls of the hotel.
     Below lies a slum, outside the hotel walls. She looks down in
     horror at a sprawling mess of impoverished, desperate people,
     mangy dogs, impoverished goats. Squalor, flies and mud.
                         HARRY
               Lot of dead babies. Guess it's hot.
     Bella stares, shocked.
                         BELLA
               We must go help them!
                         HARRY
               And how will we do that?

                We go down    there, they'll quite
                rightfully    rope us, rob us and rape
                us. And if    they were here and we
                were there    we would do the same to
                them.
      Bella runs.

      She runs down the stairs screaming, tripping and falling.
      Harry catches up to her, puts his hand over her mouth. She
      clamps her teeth on his hand.

      Bella wakes to find dinner suited Duncan, asleep, an empty
      bottle of whisky on his chest, some of the content poured all
      over his shit when he passed out. He is covered in money. A
      couple of stacks on the bedside table as well. Bella stares
      at it.
      She gets up, gathers up the money into a bag. And heads out.

      Bella walks to the walkway off the boat. Two stewards are
      preparing to cast off.
                          STEWARD
                We are casting off ma'am.
                          BELLA
                But I must go back? I must give
                this money to the poor near the
                hotel, in something called a slum.
                          STEWARD 2
                We are staying ashore Ma'am. We can
                take care of that for you.
                             BELLA
                You can?
                          STEWARD
                Of course, it is generous of you.

                          BELLA
                They need money.
                          STEWARD
                Everyone does.
                             BELLA
                Thank you.
      She heads off back up the plank. The two stewards smile at
      each other, check the money.

102   INT CABIN HALLWAY - NIGHT                                102
      Bella walks down the hall. A steward stands in the doorway of
      the cabin.
      Bella hears Duncan's voice as she approaches.
                           DUNCAN
                    (to the steward)
                You get me the Captain! Now, we'll
                find this fucken thief!
      He sees Bella. She sees he is upending the room.
                          DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                Bella! We've been robbed. I won! I
                won everything, like never before!
                But now it's gone!

                          BELLA
                You haven't been robbed. I took it.

                             DUNCAN
                What?

                             BELLA
                I took it.
      She wanders in and flops down on the bed.

                           BELLA (CONT'D)
                I am so tired. Or maybe just my
                spirit is. My soul has been
                buckled, crumpled, flattened,
                Duncan Wedderburn by the sights I
                have seen.

      He stares at her nonplussed.

                          STEWARD
                So, no need for the Captain then
                sir?
                      Poor Things - Final Cut            56.


                       DUNCAN
             Fuck off before I break all your
             teeth!
                       STEWARD
             Indeed sir.
                       DUNCAN
             Where is it?
She cries.
                       DUNCAN (CONT'D)
             You hid it for safety. I was drunk
             and foolishly left it everywhere.
             What a relief.
                       BELLA
             I did not hide it. I gave it all
             away to these poor people, out
             there. Money is its own form of
             sickness or at least the scarcity
             of it. And who am I lying on a
             featherbed as dead babies lie in
             a...Oh Duncan.

                         DUNCAN
             You what?

                       BELLA
             I am expecting a hug of solace.

                         DUNCAN
             You...

                       BELLA
             I need to offer something to the
             world and yet I have nothing.
             Except some money. It is a bad day
             for Bella Baxter.
He grabs her hard.

                       DUNCAN
             Where is my fucking money?!

                       BELLA
             I just told you I gave it away to
             the poor.

The steward returns, knocks on the still open door. An
officer with him.

                       DUNCAN
             I thought I told you to fuck off?!

                          OFFICER
                The steward informs me you may not
                have sufficient funds to make good
                your account sir.
                          BELLA
                That is probably true, I gave it
                all away to some nice men to pass
                onto the slum poor.
      The steward smiles.
                          OFFICER
                You will be offloaded at the next
                port and confined to staff rations
                until then. Good evening.
                          DUNCAN
                How dare you?!
      The steward steps forward and punches Duncan in the stomach,
      winding him. He pushes him over and pulls the door shut.

                Fine. I'm sorry.

                You were trying to help me
                understand.
                          HARRY
                No. I actually wanted to hurt you.
                I couldn't bear to see such dumb
                beautiful happiness in someone. It
                was cruel of me.

                          BELLA
                I am not sorry. If I know the world
                I can improve it.
                          HARRY
                You can't Bella. That is the real
                point. Don't accept the lie, of
                religion, socialism, capitalism, we
                are a fucked species. Know it. Hope
                is smashable. Realism is not.
                Protect yourself with the truth.
      Bella looks at him.
                          BELLA
                I realize what you are now Harry,
                just a broken little boy who cannot
                bear the pain of the world.
                          HARRY
                I suppose so.
      She kisses him on the cheek.
                           BELLA
                Goodbye Harry. We get thrown off in
                Marseille.
                          HARRY
                Why do you stay with him.
                          BELLA
                I always think it will be better.
                          HARRY
                Of course you do.
      She walks off.

                Fucken Paris with no money. What do
                you suggest we do Bella?

                          BELLA
                Is it not an interesting

                will we live now?

                          BELLA
                Exactly. That is the experiment. We
                are now the poor. Also many
                adventurers have faced these odds.

      Duncan starts weeping into his hands.

                Selfish, thoughtless, careless

                think things through to the logical
                conclusions is not strong, I did
                help those suffering people.
                I have ruined us as you point out,

          Good day my fresh, darling, English
          rose.
                    BELLA
          Is this a hotel?
                    SWINEY
          We have rooms. Are you looking for
          work?
                    BELLA
          How much is a room?
                    SWINEY
          I charge you 10 francs an hour. You
          charge them thirty, everyone's
          happy.
                    BELLA
          Hmmm. I see.

          Monsieur Chapelle. Fresh from

He looks Bella up and down.

          Merci.

          So. Off you go?
                    BELLA
          At this point I am confused.
                    SWINEY
          You are not here to work? C'mon,
          lay with him, let him cock you a
          bit and make some nice francs.
                    BELLA
          I see. He would pay me for this?
                    SWINEY
          Yes. If you need money, it is the
          shortest route to it.

                I have never been `cocked' by
                another man, and yet have wondered
                on that. And am in need of funds.
                It is I believe, a confluence of
                circumstances I regard as almost
                fate-like. Let us do this.

      He shakes his head no.
                          BELLA (CONT'D)
                Mysterious.

      She lays down. He pushes her dress up. Lays down on her.
      Starts to position himself.

                          BELLA (CONT'D)
                Should we warm me up a bit fir-

      He thrusts himself into her.
                             BELLA (CONT'D)
                Ow.

      He thrusts himself into her three times.

                    BELLA
          Good day sir. Eclair au chocolat. I
          have come into some money, and some
          enlightenment.
                    DUNCAN
          You stole it?!
                    BELLA
          You have always said you are the
          best bedman in the world, and I
          have never known another so knew
          not whether this was true. But now
          I do! And he was terrible and made
          an ungodly noise as he thrust
          himself into me, and a mere three
          thrusts Duncan Wedderburn was all
          he could manage! Well I stifled a
          laugh out of polites of course,
          took his money, thanked him,
          laughed all the way to buy us this
          eclair, and thought so fondly as I
          remembered all the fierce sweaty
          nights of ours.
                    DUNCAN
          You... fucked for money?
                    BELLA
          And as an experiment. Which I think
          will aid us in our relationship as
          it gladdens my heart for you, and
          my heart has been a little bit dim
          on your weepy sweary person lately.
He throws the eclair at her.
                    DUNCAN
          YOU ARE A MONSTER. A WHORE AND A
          MONSTER! You are a demon sent from
          hell to rip my spirit to shreds to
          punish my tiny sins with a tsunami
          of destruction. To take my heart
          and pull it like taffy, to ruin me.
          I look at you and see nothing but
          ugliness.
                    BELLA
          That last bit was uncalled for and
          makes no sense as your odes to my
          beauty have been boring but
          constant and now a simple act of
          letting old wrinkled man ride on me
          seems to erase this.
                    DUNCAN
          Fuuuck! You whored yourself.

                    BELLA
          Which now you are going to explain
          to me is bad. Can I never win with
          you?!
                    DUNCAN
          It is the worst thing a woman can
          do.
                    BELLA
          We should definitely not ever
          marry. I am a flawed experimenting
          person so I will need a husband
          with a more forgiving disposition.
                      DUNCAN
          Cunnnnt.
                    BELLA
          My instinct now tells me you are
          not that. Our adventure is clearly
          over.
She rips open stitching in her dress, pulls God's bills
forth.
                    BELLA (CONT'D)
          I shall buy you a passage back to
          London.

Duncan stares at her.

                    DUNCAN
          You had money?! The whole time!

                    BELLA
          It is God's money for emergencies.

                    DUNCAN
          It has been a fucking emergency for
          weeks!
                    BELLA
          I believed in you the whole time.
          That you would rise to the
          occasion. Now however I see that
          was misplaced and there is
          something broken in you.

                    DUNCAN
          You broke that something in me!

                    BELLA
          I feel this conversation has become
          circular.

                      DUNCAN

      Bella stands before Swiney.
                          BELLA
                Madam Swiney, I have examined my
                situation. I need sex and money. I
                could take a lover, another
                Wedderburn who would keep me, but
                may require an awful lot of
                attention or it's twenty minutes at
                a time and the rest of my day is
                free to study on the world and the
                improving of it. Hence I seek
                employment, in your musty smelling
                establishment of good time
                fornication.
      Swiney smiles at her.

                A woman plotting her course to
                freedom. How delightful. Come.
      A group of women sit on chairs in the small foyer, waiting
      for clients. Swiney enters with Bella.

      butcher enters.
                          SWINEY (CONT'D)
                Ah monsieur Saveur.

      He gives her a packet of freshly cut meat.

                          SAVEUR
                Filet mignon.

                          SWINEY
                A prime cut. Et pour vous?

      She points to the women, he eyes them. Nods at Bella.

                          SWINEY (CONT'D)
                Bella.

      She follows the butcher up the stairs. Passes Toinette, one
      of the girls, in her twenties.

      He pushes in a door. Bella follows him in. She looks at him.
      He gets undressed. Bella reels a bit.
                          BELLA
                Is that smell you?
      He walks toward her, pushes her against the wall. Starts
      fucking her.
      He groans. Orgasms.
                          BELLA (CONT'D)

      Bella nods. As he exits, Toinette comes in. She has a cup of
      tea and a handkerchief.

                          TOINETTE
                C'est un mouchoir � la lavende.
                Pour l'odeur. For the smell.

      Bella takes it smells it.

                          TOINETTE (CONT'D)
                And.. tea just... because tea is
                nice. Un petit peu English.

                          BELLA
                Merci. It was brutal, in a
                strangely not unpleasant way.

      Toinette looks at Bella. She laughs.

                          TOINETTE
                Pamphlet. Read. Je suis socialiste.
                          BELLA

                          BELLA
                Ah Mrs Swiney, this line up system.
                You really expect me to go upstairs
                with a man even if I find him
                distasteful and so am slightly sad
                when I let him furious jump me?

                That is the way it is my darling.
                Gosh you look pretty. How it agrees
                with you to be ravaged.
                          BELLA
                I suppose. But..
      The man interrupts. Points at Bella, but speaks to Swiney.

                Sir would you not prefer it if the
                women chose? As it would be a sign
                of enthusiasm for you rather than
                the vague sense that they are in a
                state of horror as you jump them.
                          MERSAULT
                Horreur? Elles ne sont pas-

                way it is until we discover the new
                way it is and so it goes until the

                old husk, and no one will want you,
                either to pay you for it or have it

                delightful you are. But we must

                sometimes. Grapple with it, try to

          of giving you choice will

smiles.

          We must work. We must make money.
          But more than that Bella, we must
          experience everything. Not just the
          good, but degradation, horror,
          sadness. This makes us whole Bella,
          makes us people of substance. Not
          flighty, untouched children. Then
          we can know the world. And when we
          know the world, the world is ours.

      Bella is crouched semi naked, facing a wall. There is a
      scuttling noise. She looks back. A naked man scuttles crab
      like across the floor, sideways but slowly toward her. He
      gets there, pulls hair from her head with his pincers and
      eats it. Bella turns to watch him, fascinated. He scuttles
      away from her.

      She starts to orgasm as does he. They finish. Bella, spent

      Bella hears a wailing sound from the alley below. She goes to
      the window, looks down.

      Duncan sits in the alley, he is pulling clumps of hair out.
      Looks up, sees her, smiles, waves, a clump of hair in his
      hands.

                Bella. I have decided to forgive
                you. I have booked our berths home.
                I have told mother to prepare our
                wedding bed. Did you fuck the guy
                with hooks for hands? You did. I

                the lingering question of how did I
                ever want you?

          I made a mistake with Bella. I
          allowed feelings to develop. But
          there are none for her, she is no
          different to the chicken dog. It is
          better this way perhaps, and gives
          some insight to my father's

                first to make the mistake.

                             TOINETTE
                Why lie?!

                          BELLA
                I am not lying! My God told me
                himself.

                Oui.

      She shrugs as if that answers that.

                             TOINETTE
                Voil�.

      Bella takes this in. Looks down at her stomach. The scar.

      A thick letter arrives, mad writing on the envelope. Max
      finds it, picks it up.

      Reads it, walks to the study where Godwin is unconscious
      laying in the day bed hooked up to a machine, pumping blood
      for him.

                          MAX
                Good day sir.

      He gets no response.

                    DUNCAN
          He has set a demon at large in the
          world, the devil has wrapped her in
          an alluring body that cannot be
          satiated and a mind that picks
          people apart stitch by stitch like
          a bloodied and burned rag doll that
          has been shat out an elephant's
          arse!
                    MAX
          Bella. Where is she?
He looks up at him as if noticing for the first time.
                    DUNCAN
          Who are you?
                    MAX
          I am her fianc� sir.
Duncan takes a beat then laughs. Scratches at his leg. Max
notices the bloody scratches all over his ankle..
                    MAX (CONT'D)
          Obviously things did not end well
          between you?

                    DUNCAN
          Did not?....she destroyed me!

                    MAX
          We are all masters of our own ship
          so there's that.

                    DUNCAN
          I do not like you and your words!
          That Godwin Baxter! He knew, and he
          set her onto me, trapped me.

                    MAX
          Where is she?!

                    DUNCAN
          I would not wish her on my worst
          enemy, I will save you sir from-

Max kicks him in the stomach.

                    MAX
          Forgive my frustration, just tell
          me.

                    DUNCAN
          It does not hurt, I have no
          insides, she has hollowed me out,
          my soul, my bank account.

      Max picks him up and slams him against a wall, surprising
      himself.
                          MAX
                I do not wish to be like this, you

      Bella stares at the house as she stands at the door. She
      smiles. Knocks.
      The door swings back. Prim looks at her.

      Prim walks away. Bella steps inside.

      up to an oxygen machine, and a glass bulb sluices blood via a
      tube in and out of his body.

      Bella comes in. She rushes to God. Hugs him. He grimaces. But
      is slightly overcome by her touch.
                          BELLA
                God! Max wrote me, you are ill?
                          BAXTER
                I am not. I am dying. A subtle
                difference, but one I take
                seriously as a physician.
                You are a sight. And a good one.
                          BELLA
                You cannot die.
                          BAXTER
                Empirical data says different. I
                missed you. I now have to lie down.
      She helps him down.
                          BELLA
                It is not all sunshine I bring, I
                also bring beady eyes and hard
                questions for you. Did I have a
                baby in me? And if so where is it?
                          BAXTER
                I see. Well, technically you are
                your baby. And also I suppose you
                are your mother. But also neither.
                No memory survives. No experiences
                survive.
                          BELLA

      stands at the door.
                          BELLA

                A bit of that as well. I just
                wanted to be with you and was not
                sure you would even understand and
                Baxter kind of makes one a prisoner
                to him, and....sorry.

      She walk into the kitchen, Felicity at the table, she is
      singing a song, which is really just the same word over and
      over as she smashes steak with a meat hammer on the table.

      her.

                It is hard to be in a position
                where one wants to hit someone who
                is already in obvious pain.
                          BAXTER
                It is a conundrum for sure. Would
                you rather be a grey slab of flesh
                with a fish hook in your nose?
      She drops her arm.

                I will feel good for a second, and
                bad for longer so...
                I really had a fish hook in my
                nose?

                          BAXTER
                Neither of you are that. She
                wanders the halls with a hammer and
                a song, that is not my doing, and I
                have read your cards and letters
                home and watched you fearlessly
                create Bella Baxter with wonder.

                You were much younger, there is
                no...bind. I was mesmerised by you
                and Baxter took advantage of it.

                          BELLA
                So you are mesmerised no more?

          okay with that? Or is the whore
          thing a challenge to the desire for
          ownership men have. Wedderburn
          became much sweary and weepy when
          he discovered my whoring.
                    MAX
          I find myself merely jealous of the
          men's time with you, rather than a
          moral aspersion against you. It is
          your body Bella Baxter. Yours to
          give freely.

          Do you believe people improvable
          Max?
                    MAX
          I do, as a human body can be cured
          of illness, so can men and women be
          cured of aspects.
                    BELLA
          Will you marry me Max McCandles?

          I will.

          I will take a note. And have you
          been checked for um... disease?

                And so by the powers vested in me
                by the church I will solemnize this
                union. Do you Bella Baxter take
                this man as your husband?
      She is about to answer.
                          ALFIE
                Did we miss the part about anyone
                objecting to this? Or has that been
                removed in some kind faux
                modernization of the catechism.
      They turn. Alfred Blessington, a sombre looking but magnetic
      man, has stormed into the church.
                          ALFIE (CONT'D)
                Hello Victoria, you look well.

                          BELLA
                Do you refer to me sir?

                himself to his wife. But if I must-

          As I was saying. General Alfred
          Blessington. Alfie to you. You
          really do not know me? When Mr.
          Wedderburn put your photo in the
          paper.
                    DUNCAN
          I remembered that old bird at the
          hotel called you Victoria
          Blessington. And pieced this
          diabolical fuckfest of a puzzle
          together.
Bella looks at Alfie.
                      BELLA
          You are-
                    ALFIE
          Your dear Alfie. You left in a
          state of some mental addlement and
          hysteria over your pregnancy. On
          the discovery of your absence I
          felt disembowelled. I have
          disembowelled men on the field of
          battle and I always imagined a dull
          hollow throbbing. And that is what
          it was like. There is also a
          stench, but that does not apply as
          a metaphor here. Here you are my
          darling. Here you are.
He comes toward her arms outstretched.

                 head. And these men have clearly
                 taken advantage of you.

                 Actually I would like to go.

                 Let us go then.
                             BAXTER
                 Bella!
      He grabs her arm. She looks at him.

      He does.

      Bella sits with Alfie in the carriage. There are flowers on
      the seat. It's a bit awkward. He smiles at her. Pats her
      hand.
                          ALFIE

      Some gates open.
      The carriage pulls into a circular driveway.
      High walls. Long driveway.
      The gates shut behind her and are bolted.
      She looks up at the mansion in front of her.

      As they head up the steps. Alfie pulls a pistol from his
      pocket. She looks at it.
                          ALFIE
                The servants and I have not been
                getting along. I fear an uprising.
      The door opens, a dishevelled butler, a cigarette hanging
      from his lip, opens it. Sees Bella. His eyes widen. He steps
      back.
                          ALFIE (CONT'D)

      David steps back, nods to her.

      As they enter, a maid with her arm in a sling, sees Bella.

      Alfie and Bella sit at the dining table. An array of dishes
      on the table. Alfie eats with gusto. She watches him.

                            ALFIE
                  Eat. All your favourites. Kippers.
                  Goose. Tongue. Champagne.
                  I missed you.

                  What do you think was the root of
                  the unhappiness, what drove her to
                  the bridge to leap off?

      He stares at her. Smiles.

                            ALFIE
                  You hated the baby, and called it
                  `the monster'.

                            BELLA
                  I see. I have noticed a lack of
                  maternal instinct.

                            ALFIE
                  And yet I am happy to have you
                  home.

                    ALFIE
          We shared a love of good times.
          Watch. Allison! Soup!
He clicks his finger. The doberman in the corner stands to
attention. Walks over to the door. As the door opens.
                       ALFIE (CONT'D)
          Rex.
The doberman leaps up on its hind legs and barks like crazy,
just as Allison enters with a tureen of soup.

Startled, Allison staggers back, falls, the tureen of soup
going all over her. Alfie roars laughing. Bella can't help
but laugh too.

                       ALLISON
          Fuck.

She gets up, makes to come at him. He takes his revolver and
waves it in her direction.

                    ALFIE
          We'll have some cheese when you
          can.

                    BELLA
          A love of cruelty. I was not a kind
          person it seems.

                    ALFIE
          Kind? You would never be so dull
          Victoria. An appalling idea.
          Wedderburn says you were a whore. I
          suspect it was part of his madn-

                    BELLA
          I was. In Paris. I tired of it but
          it was fascinating.

Alfie stares at her as she tries kippers.

                       ALFIE
          Right.

                    BELLA
          These kippers are strangely
          delicious. Vinegary or something.

Marriage is a constant challenge
some we bend to some we bend to us.
I will try to forgive you for the
whoring, your sexual hysteria was
often out of hand, and also for the
killing of our unborn child. In
fact when I list how you've wronged
me Jesus Christ himself would
probably beat your head in with a
bat. You are blessed with a
forgiving husband.
          BELLA
I have not wronged you. For I do
not know you Alfie.
          ALFIE
You're in luck as I've had a lot of
experience in the field with
amnesia, either men who wished to
forget where they were, or a mortar
exploded nearby ringing their
cranium like a church bell. I
suggest we stick close to the house
for several months or a year until
you have made a full recovery.
          BELLA
I will leave at my leisure but I am
flattered by your desire to trap
me. You are not the first.
          ALFIE
I will have to shoot you in the
fucking head if you try to leave
darling.
          BELLA
The front or the back of the head?
          ALFIE
The back as to be sure you were
leaving and I was not being rash.
I have missed you.
          BELLA
So I am a prisoner?
          ALFIE
This conversation has gone down an
unfortunate route. I am sure you
will be as happy as you were
before.
          BELLA
As I was before? When I threw
myself from a bridge?

                Rather not. I would however like to
                leave. I found our time together
                interesting, but having now
                ascertained why I threw myself from

                near dead God.

                darling my life is dedicated to the
                taking of territory. You are mine

          The root of the problem is between
          your legs and I will have it off
          and it will not distract and divert
          you anymore. A man spends his life
          wrangling his sexual compulsions,
          it's a curse, and yet in some ways
          his life's work. A woman's life's

          you of that infernal packet between
          your legs and plant a seed straight
          after.
                    BELLA
          Let me explain what has happened.
          Victoria, your wife, threw herself
          from a bridge and died. Baxter
          found her, took her to his surgery,
          he then removed the baby, removed
          the brain from the baby,
          transplanted it into my head and
          reanimated me.
                      ALFIE
          Uh huh.
                    BELLA
          I'll bring you the file. It's
          actually quite fascinating.
          However, I will keep my new life
          and my lovely old clitoris thank
          you. So if you'd call for a
          carriage for me-
Alfie draws a gun.

          They talk and talk, and at some
          point there is nothing left but to
          pull a gun. It is the way with
          women.
Bella walks to him calmly. He studies her.
                    ALFIE (CONT'D)
          Are you giving in?

                    BELLA
          I'd rather you shot me in the
          fucking heart.

                    ALFIE
          I will oblige if I have to. Drink
          the drink my darling. Chloroform
          and gin, delicious.

She picks it up.

                          BELLA
                In some ways it would be a relief
                to be rid of my questing self.
                          ALFIE
                Sip deeply and that freedom is
                yours.
      She tosses it suddenly in his face. Grabs at the gun, they
      struggle. It goes off. They stop. There is a hole in Alfie's
      foot. Blood pools out.Bella sees the blood pouring onto the
      floor. As does he. Bella still has the gun.
                          ALFIE (CONT'D)
                Fuck.
      He reaches for her suddenly, but then topples over. She looks
      down at him.

155   INT BAXTER'S FOYER - DAY                                 155

      Alfie lies on the ground in the foyer, bleeding. Prim stands
      staring at him. Bella and Max enter.

                          BELLA
                We must get him up to the surgery.
                He will die if we cannot stop it.

                          PRIM
                He's bleeding a lot.

      Alfie is falling in and out of consciousness.

                          ALFIE
                You're....fucking...de..ad..

      He passes out.

                          MAX
                Bella, if he lives...I sense he is
                not a man who will stop.

                          BELLA
                I will not watch him bleed to death
                Max, but I agree, he could do with
                improvement.

      Bella and Prim drag Alfie down the hall.

156   INT BAXTER'S HOUSE SURGERY - DAY                         156
      Alfie lies on the surgical table, unconscious. Max is
      operating in his gown. He digs into the bloody flesh, tries
      to get the bullet.
                            MAX
                  I have controlled the bleeding.
      He looks up as Bella leads the goat in.
                            BELLA
                  I have the notes.
      He looks at her. She smiles.
                            BELLA (CONT'D)
                  I am never happier than when I am
                  in here.

      She picks up a scalpel.

157   INT BAXTER'S HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT                  157

      Baxter is set up on the sofa, machines pumping around him.
      Bella lays down next to him.

                              BAXTER
                  Bella.

      She takes his hand.

                            BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  You're back.

      She nods.

                            BELLA
                  It was just a story of someone
                  else, not Bella Baxter.

      Max lies down the other side of Baxter.

                            BAXTER
                  All my life people's eyes looked at
                  me, horror, pity...

      He smiles as she stares at him with love.

                              BAXTER (CONT'D)
                  But you.

      He kisses her head.

                 It is very interesting... what is
                 happening...

      He presses her hand. She kisses his forehead. She looks at
      his hand, limp in hers. He's dead. His eyes open.

      Bella stares at him. With her fingers closes his eye lids.
      Lays her head on his chest.


158   EXT BAXTER'S HOUSE GARDEN - DAY                            158

      In a courtyard garden. Max is making drinks. Prim throws a
      ball at Felicity. She has mastered catching the ball. She's
      very happy. Toinette lounging on a chair and next to Bella
      reading.

                           BELLA
                 Anatomy exam is making me nervous.

                           MAX
                 I have tested you many times, you
                 know it.

                           TOINETTE
                 No one knows anatomy better than
                 you. Crois-moi.

                           BELLA
                 Certainement- effectivement.
                 Ladies? Gin?

                            PRIM
                 Please.

                            FELICITY
                 Gin.

                           BELLA
                 And we should get water for the
                 general.

      We cut to Alfie. He is on the lawn on all fours, eating
      grass. He bleats.

                           PRIM
                 Felicity. Water.

      Alfie eats grass. Bella and Toinette clink glasses, happy.
      Max, Prim, happy. Felicity makes her way slowly to get water.

      Bella smiles as she reads her book.
