    FADE IN:

1   EXT. IRISH HILLSIDE - NIGHT                                   1

    All seems peaceful as the following, in OLD IRISH STYLE
    LETTERING, appears on the screen:

                     IRELAND... ONCE UPON A TIME

    Suddenly, LIGHTNING illuminates the night sky.

    WILLIAM O'DAY, a man in his forties, runs for his life,
    through gnarled trees. A metal SHACKLE is around his neck.
    His breath is heavy with fear. He glances behind him in
    terror, as the intense chase winds its way through the dark
    forest.

    Suddenly, he grabs at the shackle around his neck. He falls
    to the ground, gasping and choking. A very long, black shadow
    of a menacing figure falls over him. Revealed is...

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Scream as you may, scream as you
               might, if you try to escape, you'll
               be dead on this night.

                         WILLIAM
               Curse you! I'd rather be dead than
               your slave.

    With a wave of the Leprechaun's hand, the shackle loosens.
    The Leprechaun approaches William, who remains on the ground.
    He removes a small cloth and begins to dust William off.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               William, foolish William.

                         WILLIAM
               What trick is this now?

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Don't you know what day it is?

                         WILLIAM
               It's a day like any other since I
               tried to take your damned pot of
               gold.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               It's the seventeenth of March, the
               Feast of St. Patrick...
                                                             2.



                        WILLIAM
                  (remembering)
              ... and your birthday!

                        LEPRECHAUN
              'Tis a special birthday for a
              Leprechaun.
                  (proudly)
              I'm one thousand years old! Tonight
              I can claim me bride.

2   EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER                                   2

    Using his shelaleigh, the Leprechaun prods William through
    the dark, shadow-filled forest.

                        WILLIAM
              Who would marry a creature like
              you?

                        LEPRECHAUN
              Wait till you gaze upon this lovely
              lass. Her lips, so soft, her face,
              so fair, her bosom, so ample. She
              is a fit match for me.

                        WILLIAM
              And what evil trick will you use to
              woo her?

                        LEPRECHAUN
              Tis simple... She sneezes once, she
              sneezes twice, she'll be me bride
              when she sneezes thrice.

                        WILLIAM
                  (confused)
              Sneezes three times?

                        LEPRECHAUN
              If no one saves her soul by
              speaking "God bless you", the fair
              maiden is mine forever.

                        WILLIAM
              And I am to be her slave as well?!

                        LEPRECHAUN
              Oh, no. The moment the lass is
              married to me, then you, my slave,
              shall be set free. You would like
              to be free, wouldn't you, William?
                                                               3.



                         WILLIAM
                   (angry, he's heard this
                    before)
               You know nothing is more precious
               to me than freedom. But why should
               I believe you?

     The Leprechaun stops walking, takes off his hat and extends
     his hand.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               By the sacred vow of the wee
               people, when I am wed, you'll have
               your freedom.

     William, tentatively takes his hand and shakes.

                                              CUT TO:

2A   EXT. A THICKET OF BRANCHES - NIGHT                           2A

     The branches part, revealing the Leprechaun and William
     looking out.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Behold, me chosen bride.

     ANGLE ON a sheet hanging on a clothesline, hung between two
     sticks. The silhouette of a shapely young woman is seen
     behind the sheet.

     William admires the fair figure.

                         WILLIAM
               May your wedding be blessed, and
               I'll thrash any soul that dare try
               and stop this union.

     The girl pulls the sheet off of the clothesline. Revealed is
     a beautiful sixteen year old girl, William's DAUGHTER.
     William freezes. A look of despair comes over his face.

     The Leprechaun purses his lips and blows in her direction.

     CLOSE ON - a dandelion - the white, puffy seeds sail off the
     stem.

     ANGLE ON - the daughter, she sneezes.

     William lets out an audible gasp.

                         WILLIAM
               Please, master... no.
                                                         4.



                    LEPRECHAUN
          What troubles YOU? Is she not
          beautiful enough for me?

                    WILLIAM
          The girl, she's my daughter!

The Leprechaun laughs.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Really? Then we are to be related!

The Leprechaun blows again, and again the daughter sneezes.
The girl takes out a linen handkerchief from her apron.

                    WILLIAM
          Master, I swear I'll find you a
          score of lasses fairer than she!

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Don't worry. I'll be gentle with
          her on our wedding night. Now just
          one more sneeze and you'll have
          your precious freedom.

The Leprechaun gives one short blow in the girl's direction.
The girl sneezes. The Leprechaun clicks his heels.

                    WILLIAM
              (under his breath)
          God bless you, my child.

The Leprechaun spins around, rage glowing in his eyes.

William runs away from the Leprechaun (the girl does not see
this interaction).

The Leprechaun holds out his hand and William magically
freezes in his tracks. Another wave of the Leprechaun's hand
jerks William magically into the air. He hangs there,
suspended from the shackle. William struggles to release the
"noose" from around his neck.

The Leprechaun stares up at his slave. William fights for his
life. His legs jerk as they dangle from above. The color
drains from his face.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          You pathetic fool! You think you
          could outsmart me?! The Genius of
          Killarney? A curse be placed upon
          your seed, William O'Day!
                    (MORE)
                                                                5.
                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               You may have saved your daughter,
               but on me next thousandth birthday,
               I will stalk your fairest offspring
               and claim her as me bride.

     William tugs at the shackle, in a futile attempt to save
     himself.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               Happy St. Patrick's Day.

     The Leprechaun's hand clenches into a fist. William screams
     in anguish. His neck snaps with a loud CRACK. William's dead
     body falls to the ground.

     The Leprechaun disappears.

     William's daughter, having heard the scream, comes running up
     a path toward William. Upon seeing her father, the daughter
     lets out a blood curdling scream. We PUSH IN to her screaming
     mouth as the FRAME GOES BLACK.

     MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

2B   INT. LEPRECHAUN'S LAIR - NIGHT                              2B

     FADE UP ON:

     A large, old, leather-bound book, "FOLKLORE AND MYTHOLOGY,"
     illuminated by candlelight and an eerie green glow.

     The LEPRECHAUN'S HANDS open the book. Each page contains an
     old-looking drawing or etching (think Gutenburg Bible)
     depicting our Leprechaun villain playing some horrible prank,
     or torturing someone. The TEXT on each page is a TITLE IN THE
     SEQUENCE.

     After the FINAL CREDIT, the Leprechaun slams the book shut.

     SLIGHTLY WIDER

     The Leprechaun sits at a desk and pushes the book aside. He
     is in a corner of a dark, dank place we will come to know as
     The Leprechaun's Lair.

     He takes a few steps away from his desk toward a wall. Using
     his claw-like hands, he digs a small hole in the wall and
     finds what he is looking for: a piece of parchment rolled up
     in a scroll. He places the scroll flat on his desk and slowly
     unrolls it.
                                                             6.



    ON THE SCROLL

    As it unrolls, we see a strange chart, starting with a small
    portrait of William's daughter. A line links this drawing to
    another drawing of the same woman, but now in different
    clothing. The Leprechaun continues to unroll the scroll, to
    reveal a long line of portraits of this woman in different
    period garb through the ages (Norman Conquests, Elizabethan
    costume, pilgrim outfit, Civil War, 20's flapper, etc.,
    ending with a modern high school year book photo. The girl's
    photo is on a page marked "TheSuper Sophomores". The
    Leprechaun's finger strokes the face on the photo.

                        LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
              Soon, soon, my dear. It's almost
              time.

    The photo DISSOLVES TO:

3   EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - DAY                                     3

    A beautiful sixteen year old girl, BRIDGET, the face in the
    photo (and the same actress who played William's daughter)
    walks down the street. She EXITS FRAME as she passes someone
    hanging a St. Patrick's Day flag outside a storefront.

    She stops near a HEARSE parked on the street. On top of the
    hearse, a sign reads: DARKSIDE TOURS. Advertised underneath
    the sign are the words: ASK ABOUT OUR MONEY MAKING FRANCHISE
    CERTIFICATES. CODY, a sixteen year old, street smart ticket
    seller, stands nearby, hawking tickets to a TOURIST and his
    GIRLFRIEND. Cody seems at ease with himself.

                        CODY
              Trust me, this tour is incredible.
              You won't believe your eyes. It
              will be the most frightening
              experience you've ever had in your
              life.

                        GIRLFRIEND
              Is it really scary?

                        CODY
              Let me put it this way: you're not
              pregnant, are you? Because our
              insurance won't cover us. We've had
              some problems. Heart conditions,
              emotionally unstable or
              suggestible, please stay away. This
              is not the tour for you.
                                                          7.



                    TOURIST
              (to his Girlfriend)
          Come on, this is a rip off.

                    CODY
          Sure, walk away. I understand. If
          hearing the actual sound of Jayne
          Mansfield's head being severed from
          her body is too intense for you,
          then more power to you. Try
          Disneyland, I think that's more
          you're speed.

                    TOURIST
          Just a second, are you saying...

                    CODY
          I'm not saying anything. This
          tour's too much for most people.
          Now, if you'll excuse me... you
          folks! Are you interested in the
          uncut, uncensored truth about
          Hollywood's darkside?

A family of MIDWESTERN TOURISTS stops.

                    DAD
          Didn't we see this on "A Current
          Event?"

                    CODY
          No, sir, you did not. This is the
          stuff the TV networks just don't
          have the guts to show.

Cody keeps an eye on the first tourist and his girlfriend,
who are in the midst of an argument.

                    GIRLFRIEND
          I want to go! If you're too scared,
          I'll meet you at the hotel.

                    TOURIST
          I'm not scared!

Cody immediately ushers the girlfriend into the hearse.

                    CODY
          Step right in, madam, there's a
          window seat reserved just for you.

Cody then turns to her boyfriend.
                                                            8.



                    CODY (CONT'D)
          You can wait for her at this really
          sweet ice cream parlor down the
          block.

The tourist won't stand for the insult.

                    TOURIST
          Gimme two tickets.

                    CODY
          There's a brave man. You won't be
          sorry.

Cody takes the tourist's money and hands him a Ziplock bag
with a Xeroxed map, a clove of garlic, a small wooden stake
and a plastic crucifix.

Bridget approaches Cody as the tourist enters the hearse.

                    BRIDGET
          An award-winning performance. Can
          you get away now?

                    CODY
          Bridget, I'll just be a minute. Let
          me get these last three suckers and
          then I'm all yours.

                    BRIDGET
              (good-naturedly)
          I understand. How can I compete
          with Jayne Mansfield's severed
          head?

                     CODY
              (playing along)
          You can't.

Cody smiles at Bridget and turns back toward the midwestern
family.

                    CODY (CONT'D)
          You folks are in luck! We've just
          had three cancellations. Better
          grab these now, our next opening
          isn't until December.

                    DAD
          I guess it's our lucky day!

The Dad pays Cody.
                                                             9.



                        CODY
              Take your seats and I'll summon
              your Guide to the Darkside,
              Mortimer, the all-knowing.

    The family enters the hearse. Cody closes the door and locks
    it.

                        CODY (CONT'D)
              All loaded in.

    Cody puts his arm around Bridget.

                        CODY (CONT'D)
              Now it's just you and me and a ton
              of hot steel going 200 miles an
              hour.

                        BRIDGET
              Cody, we're going to the go-kart
              park, not the Indy 500.

                        CODY
              A boy can dream, can't he?

                        BRIDGET
                  (happily)
              I can't believe we're actually
              going to spend an afternoon
              together.

    Cody becomes apologetic.

                        CODY
              Listen, this job's important. I've
              got to make enough money to pay for
              my sister's eye operation.

                        BRIDGET
              Good plan. If only you had a
              sister.

                        CODY
              You know me too well.

                        BRIDGET
              Let's'go nab your uncle and split.

4   INT. DARKSIDE TOURS OFFICE/APARTMENT - LATER                  4

    Cody undoes a vast myriad of locks. He and Bridget enter his
    loft. In one corner is the "living space" -- a couple of fold-
    out cots, an eat-in kitchen, a coffee table.
                                                            10.



    A large bookshelf separates this area from the
    "office/museum," a cluttered mess crammed with horror
    memorabilia. Mannequins dressed to look like monsters and
    victims stare out eerily. There are boxes of brochures for
    "Darkside Tours Franchises" as well as "Genuine Franchise
    Certificates" among old pizza boxes and Chinese food cartons.

                        BRIDGET
              I'm glad to see you guys got that
              cleaning lady.

                          CODY
              Morty!

    Bridget looks under a pile of laundry stacked on the floor.

                        BRIDGET
              He's not under the shirts.

    Cody finds a flyer advertising "St. Patrick's Day special --
    Happy Hour all day long at Brennen's Pub!" Cody shakes his
    head, realizing.

                        CODY
              I know where he is.

5   EXT. BRENNEN'S PUB - FOLLOWING                                5

    A WORKMAN stands on a ladder hanging a banner that reads:
    "HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY." The ladder is open over the
    doorway to the bar. Cody ducks under the ladder to head
    inside. Bridget stops short.

                        CODY
              What's the matter?

                          BRIDGET
              Bad luck.

    Cody grabs Bridget's wrist and pulls her in.

                          CODY
              Come on.

6   INT. BRENNEN'S PUB - FOLLOWING                                6

    In the darkened pub, fresh decorations announce that it's St.
    Patrick's Day.

    MORTY, a slightly disheveled man in his forties, sits at the
    bar, pushing one of his DARKSIDE FRANCHISE BROCHURES to a
    plastered and oblivious patron, sitting face down at the bar.
    Morty, too, has had a few too many to drink.
                                                         11.



Cody approaches Morty, and Morty raises his hand, in a
gesture that says, "wait a second."

                    MORTY
          You look like the kind of man who
          can recognize a great opportunity
          when he sees one. By investing in a
          Darkside Tours Franchise, you can
          turn death into dollars! I can
          almost guarantee a forty-five
          percent annual return.

FRANK, the bartender, chimes in.

                    FRANK
          How 'bout you guarantee you'll pay
          for that last round?

                    MORTY
          Frank, I'm entertaining a client.
              (back to the "client")
          By being a partial franchisee, you
          can own five percent -- for a mere
          six hundred dollars. What do you
          say? Have we a deal?

Morty grabs the guy's head by his hair, and nods it "yes."

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          Your children will thank you.
          Frank, you're a witness to this
          transaction!

                    CODY
          Morty, let's go, we've got a full
          hearse waiting.

                    MORTY
          They can wait. Another round to
          welcome the newest member of the
          Darkside Family. Bridget, always a
          delight to see you. You know, you
          can never be too young to invest in
          the future.

                    BRIDGET
          Morty, you've given me a dozen
          brochures. I'll let you know when
          my father reads them.

                    MORTY
          She's a good kid, Cody. Frank,
          where's that drink?
                                                            12.



    Frank puts a shot glass in front of Morty. He tosses it back,
    then spits it out.

                        MORTY (CONT'D)
              What the hell is this?

                        FRANK
              "Red's Special Rye" -- cola and
              water. You've had enough.

                        MORTY
              How dare you! I'm as dry as can be!

    Morty attempts to stand, but collapses at the bar, joining
    his "client" in oblivion.

                        FRANK
                  (to Cody)
              The "usual?"

    Cody nods. Frank slams a bucket of ice cubes onto the bar.

    Cody takes it and helps his uncle stand up. From a large
    glass jar on the bar, Cody pulls out a stick of beef jerky
    and hands it to Bridget.

                        CODY
                  (to Bridget)
              Have one of these, on me. This'll
              just take a second.

7   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                           7

    Cody holds Morty's head under a sink of ice-filled water.
    Morty comes up for air.

                         MORTY
              I'm sober. I'm sober.
                  (beat)
              Wait.

    Morty sticks his head into the ice water one last time. He
    comes up again.

                        MORTY (CONT'D)
              Okay. Gimme a comb.

                        CODY
                  (angrily)
              I don't have one. You look fine.

    Morty uses his fingers to comb his hair.
                                                        13.



                    MORTY
          It's a great day today, Cody. I
          just sold another five percent
          share of the franchise...

                    CODY
              (very impatiently)
          Look, Morty, we've got a full
          hearse waiting for the tour. I've
          even suckered two rubes for the
          deluxe package. Let's go.

Cody hands Morty a wad of cash, which Morty fingers happily.

                    MORTY
          Just two! You're slipping, kid.

                     CODY
          I was in kind of a hurry. Bridget
          and I have a date to meet up with
          some kids from school at the go-
          kart park.

                    MORTY
          Ah, l'amour. But one day you'll
          wake up, kid, and you'll realize
          there's only one thing that a woman
          wants... she'll grab your heart,
          tear it out of your chest, throw it
          on the floor...

                    CODY
          Not now, Morty, please. They're
          waiting.

Morty, disoriented, looks around.

                    MORTY
          Indeed they are. Where are my keys?
          The Darkside awaits us.

Cody hands Morty the car keys. Morty attempts to make a
dramatic exit... but walks into one of the toilet stalls.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          Where'd they put that door?

Morty takes another step, then slips on the floor.

                    CODY
          Morty, you can't give the tour!
                                                        14.



                     MORTY
          Why not?

                    CODY
          Because you're plastered!

                    MORTY
          So, what difference does that make?
          What's the number one rule?

                    CODY
          I know, I know, "Never turn away a
          paying customer."

                    MORTY
          I may be a little "loose," but not
          so far gone that I'm going to turn
          away a packed hearse.

Morty tries to walk out and, obliviously, crashes into the
partition in front of the bathroom door.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          On the other hand, there's the
          second rule.

                    CODY
          Which is...?

                    MORTY
          Never kill a paying customer.
              (sadly)
          Maybe we should cancel. Here,
          better give 'em their money back.

Cody is stunned.

                    CODY
          Wow. You are plastered! That's
          almost three hundred dollars!

There's a loud KNOCK on the men's room door.

                    BRIDGET (O.S.)
          Cody, let's go! We're already half
          an hour late.

Cody takes a hard look at the wad of cash. He grabs his head,
torn by a difficult decision. Cody makes up his mind. He
angrily takes the money and the car keys from Morty's hands.
                                                            15.



                        CODY
                  (resolved)
              Gimme the keys.

                        MORTY
              What are you doing?

                        CODY
              Rule number three: there's no such
              thing as a refund, remember? I'll
              give the stupid tour.

                        MORTY
                  (proudly)
              That's my boy.

    Cody exits the bathroom.

8   INT. BRENNEN'S PUB - DAY                                      8

    Bridget waits for Cody by the men's room door. Cody emerges.

                        BRIDGET
              Ready to go?

                        CODY
              Uh... yeah.

                        BRIDGET
              What is it?

                        CODY
              Well, we won't have to take the bus
              to the go-kart park.

                        BRIDGET
              Is Morty going to give us a lift in
              the hearse?

                         CODY
              Sort of.

    Bridget smells trouble.

                        BRIDGET
              What do you mean, "sort of?"

    Cody has trouble spitting out these words. He turns to her,
    seriously. This is difficult.

                        CODY
              I have to give the tour.
                                                              16.



                          BRIDGET
                   (hurt)
               Cody, we were finally going to
               spend some time together outside of
               school!

                         CODY
               I know, I'm sorry, but I really
               don't have a choice. It's a lot of
               money, you know?

                         BRIDGET
               Yeah, I bet it is. You've done this
               too many times, Cody.

                         CODY
               We can still have some fun. You can
               be my co-pilot to the darkside.

     Bridget brushes past Cody and out the door. Cody follows.

9    EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON                                   9

     The Darkside Hearse winds through the Hollywood Hills.

                         CODY (O.S.)
               Welcome, death seekers. I am Baron
               Franken-Cody-Stein, your substitute
               usher into the darkside. Our
               cruising altitude this afternoon
               will be six feet under...

     Cody makes an attempt at a Vincent Price-like ghoulish laugh.

10   INT. HEARSE - CONTINUOUS                                    10

     Cody sits at the wheel of the hearse. He looks to Bridget,
     sitting next to him, for approval. She looks out the window,
     ignoring him. Cody tries his best to coax a smile from her.

                         CODY
               If there's anything we can do to
               make your tour more terrifying,
               please don't hesitate to scream.

     Cody presses a button on the dashboard, and a SCRATCHY,
     SLIGHTLY OFF-SPEED RECORDING of a STOCK HORROR "SCREAM"is
     heard.

                         GIRLFRIEND
               Is there going to be a bathroom
               stop?
                                                             17.



     Bridget turns to Cody.

                         BRIDGET
                   (sarcastically)
               They're really eating it up.

                         TOURIST
               When are we going to see the death
               houses?!

11   EXT. STREET - FOLLOWING                                   11

     The hearse pulls up in front of a dilapidated inner city
     house. A couple of washing machines are parked on the front
     lawn.

12   INT. HEARSE - FOLLOWING                                   12

     Cody quickly turns to Bridget.

                         CODY
               There are some index cards in the
               glove box. Give me number fifteen.

     Bridget thumbs through the cards and hands him the first one
     on the stack -- number three. Cody reads a paragraph printed
     on the back.

                         CODY (CONT'D)
               "From this cliff, high above the
               Pacific Ocean, lies the death site
               of..." Wait a second.
                   (a whisper, to Bridget)
               You gave me the wrong card!

                         BRIDGET
                   (feigning surprise)
               Did I? Oh, here you go.

     She hands him the correct card. Suddenly, the SOUND of a hard
     spray of water splashes across the window. Cody looks up. An
     angry HOUSEWIFE, holding a hose, yells at Cody.

13   EXT. FRONT LAWN - FOLLOWING                               13

                         HOUSEWIFE
               My husband's sick, but he ain't
               dead! Get that creepy-ass vehicle
               off my property.

     Cody quickly pulls away.
                                                                18.



14   INT. HEARSE -FOLLOWING                                       14

                         CODY
               By the way, that was the final home
               of Bela Lugosi.

                         DAD
               Then who the hell was that?

                         CODY
               Uh... his stepdaughter, Stella
               Lugosi.

     Cody again looks to Bridget, searching for a smile.

     continues its journey.

     The hearse travels up Laurel Canyon as night falls over the
     city. It stops by a set of stone steps, leading nowhere.

22   INT. HEARSE - NIGHT                                          22

     Cody re-examines an index card, making sure it is the correct
     one. Bridget looks at her watch.

                         BRIDGET
               I should've taken the bus.

                         CODY
               One more stop and then we're
               there.You'll love this, it's my
               favorite.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
                Listen carefully, and you can hear
                his screams. During his life, he
                could escape from any bonds. Yet
                his spirit cannot escape from these
                haunted grounds."

      The tourists, actually interested, look out the window.

      Suddenly, the dirty face of a HOMELESS MAN pops outside the
      window, staring inside, startling the tourists. They all
      GASP. Cody quickly pulls away.

23    EXT. HOUDINI'S RUINS - NIGHT                                23

      The Homeless Man watches the hearse drive away as he stumbles
      back to the ruins. Sections of a stone wall remain on the
      grounds. The area is covered in fallen leaves and litter. The
      Homeless Man ducks down and passes through a thick set of
      bushes.

23A   EXT. HOUDINI'S RUINS - TREE SITE - NIGHT                   23A

      ANGLE ON: The other side of the bushes as the Homeless Man
      comes through them. We FOLLOW the Homeless Man to an old,
      twisted oak tree. He unrolls his sleeping bag next to the
      tree and ducks down, ready to call it a night. The CAMERA
      HOLDS on an old placard, nailed to the tree, which reads: TO
      OUR FRIEND HARRY HOUDINI, FROM THE PEOPLE OF KILLARNEY,
      IRELAND.

      The Homeless Man takes a pull from a whiskey bottle and
      relaxes. The bottle, held loosely in his hand, spills a few
      drops into the soft earth. Suddenly the bottle is pulled from
      his hand by an unseen force and is magically "pulled" to the
      base of the tree. It topples over, its neck stuck in some
      overlapping roots. The bottle starts to drain out.

      The Homeless Man becomes aware of this, and grabs hold of the
      bottle, trying to pull it from the roots. He cannot.
      Suddenly, the roots OPEN UP, sucking the bottle inside. The
      man falls back, having lost this "tug of war."

      A loud CRACK is heard as the tree OPENS UP, splitting down
      the middle. Light and smoke spew from the gaping hole, left
      wide open. Out of the chaos steps... The Leprechaun, holding
      the bottle of whiskey. The Leprechaun takes a long pull,
      spits it out, and looks at the bottle.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Blended Canadian? The only whiskey
                is Irish whiskey!
                                                             20.



     The Homeless Man, freaked out, smiles back, feebly. A gold
     tooth gleams in the Homeless Man's mouth. The Leprechaun
     takes notice of this.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Is that a piece of gold I see?

     The Homeless Man immediately reaches for his gold tooth and
     begins to back away.

     The Leprechaun looks to the earth.

     Suddenly, tree roots EXPLODE through the ground, grabbing the
     Homeless Man's legs and arms. They tie around the petrified
     man. The Leprechaun calmly walks over and stares into the
     terrified man's eyes.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Sit back, my friend, you may feel
               some pain. 'Tis pity I've forgotten
               me novocaine.

     The Leprechaun puts the heel of his shoe on the man's chin
     and reaches into the man's mouth with his claw-like fingers.
     The Leprechaun pulls hard. The man struggles in agony,
     screaming. Yank! The Leprechaun has a new piece of gold.

     As the man cries in pain, the Leprechaun holds up the bottle
     of whiskey.

                            LEPRECHAUN
               Now rinse.

     He pours the alcohol over the open wound. The man screams in
     pain. Suddenly, the tree roots disappear into the ground,
     releasing the Homeless Man, who gets to his feet and runs
     away.

     The Leprechaun walks back to the tree and conjures his POT OF
     GOLD, an ancient looking brass crock, teeming with gold
     pieces of all sorts (coins, jewelry,'religious artifacts, a
     four knuckle ring, Krugerrands, a gold hai, etc.). The crock
     hovers, magically, in front of the Leprechaun. He drops the
     tooth into the pot.

24   EXT. GRAND PRIX - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT                  24

     Several go carts speed around a track. The hearse drives into
     the parking lot of GRAND PRIX, a go cart amusement park.

25   INT. HEARSE - SAME TIME                                      25

     As the hearse comes to a stop, Bridget gets up and leaves.
                                                             21.



                         TOURIST
               What the hell are we doing here?

     Cody gets up and follows Bridget.

                         CODY
               Bathroom stop. Ten minutes.

                            GIRLFRIEND
               Thank God.

     The tourists follow Cody out of the hearse.

26   EXT. PARKING LOT - FOLLOWING                              26

     Cody races after Bridget in the parking lot. She heads into
     the office, and Cody follows.

                         CODY
               Bridget, wait a second!

27   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                         27

     Bridget enters the office. Inside, IAN, a cool eighteen year
     old dude, is busy at a safe, reading the combination from the
     bottom of a racing trophy. He stops what he's doing as soon
     as he sees Bridget.

                         IAN
               Bridget, I'm glad you made it!

                         BRIDGET
               Hey, Ian, where is everybody?

     Cody enters. Bridget looks back at him.

                         IAN
               They're already down at the track.
               Did you change your hair style? It
               looks great!

                            BRIDGET
               Thanks.

     Cody and Ian give each other looks. They clearly don't like
     each other.

                         CODY
               Bridget, can we just go outside and
               talk for a second?
                                                          22.



                       IAN
             Oh, Cody, I didn't know you were
             going to hang with us.

                       BRIDGET
             He's not. He's got a hearse full of
             paying customers outside.

Ian goes back to the safe and opens it. He puts some zippered
cash envelopes inside and then locks it tight.

                       IAN
             Still running that classy tour,
             huh? Come on, Bridget, let's get to
             the track. I saved a special crash
             helmet just for you.

                       BRIDGET
             Don't you need to work?

                       IAN
             Not if you're here. I can get
             someone to cover for me.

Bridget glances back at Cody.

LOW ANGLE POV

As Ian talks, Bridget is being watched from behind a filing
cabinet. Ian picks up the phone and punches a number.

                       IAN
             Hey, Billy, I gotta take the night
             off.. Can you come down and watch
             the shop?

                       CODY
             Listen, Bridget, I'm really sorry,
             but I promise I'll make it up to
             you.

The "watcher" approaches Bridget quickly. Bridget turns
around and looks down in fear.

                          BRIDGET
             Oh my God!

Cody and Ian look down at the "watcher."

WIDE ANGLE

The "watcher," ANDRETTI, a Rottweiler, bares his teeth,
snarling.
                                                             23.



                         IAN
               Andretti, no!

     Ian extends the back of his wrist for the dog to sniff. The
     dog calms down.

                         IAN
                   (to the dog)
               These are friends. Now scram.

     The dog exits through a "doggy door" .built into the front
     door.

                         IAN
                   (to Bridget)
               That was Andretti, our guard dog.
               Come on, let's go start our
               engines.

     Ian and Bridget walk out together. Cody follows.

28   EXT. GRAND PRIX COMPOUND - LATER                             28

     Cody stops Bridget.

                         CODY
               What if I come by and pick you up
               later?

                         BRIDGET
               It's okay, I'm sure I can get a
               ride home with one of the guys.

     Bridget starts to walk away.

                         CODY
               Look, next time, I promise things
               will be different.

                         BRIDGET
               What makes you think there's going
               to be a next time?

     Bridget turns on her heel, leaving Cody alone. Cody and Ian
     lock eyes. Ian obnoxiously waves "bye bye" and puts his arm
     around Bridget.

29   INT. HEARSE - LATER                                          29

     Cody drives, distracted.

                         TOURIST
               Where are we going now?
                                                                24.



      Cody has no interest in continuing the tour.

                          CODY
                This is our moment of silence for
                the souls of the damned we've
                visited on the tour.

      TOURIST: This tour sucks! I told you it'd be a rip-off.

                          DAD
                Yeah, just take us back to
                Hollywood Boulevard!

                            CODY
                Fine!

      Cody angrily floors the gas.

29A   EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT                                  29A

      The hearse speeds through a red light. A police car, lights
      flashing, pulls the hearse over.

29B   INT. HEARSE - NIGHT                                        29B

      Cody sees the policeman approach the hearse.

                           CODY
                To your left, folks, the ghost of
                Jack Webb.

30    INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                 30

      The precinct lobby is filled with the light hustle and bustle
      of an average night. POLICE OFFICERS come and go. Morty
      stands, appearing angry, listening to the DESK SERGEANT.

      DESK SERGEANT: Operating a vehicle for hire with only a
      learner's permit, running a red light, endangering the lives
      of passengers, no insurance, and six seatbelt violations.
      These are serious offenses.

                          MORTY
                    (putting on an act)
                That punk! When he gets home --
                I'll throttle him!

                          DESK SERGEANT
                Hey, take it easy. I think we gave
                him a pretty good scare.
                                                        25.



                     MORTY
          Yeah, well, just show me where to
          sign, I'll take him off your
          shoulders.

                    DESK SERGEANT
          I can only release him to his
          parents.

                    MORTY
          His parents passed away three years
          ago. God rest their souls. I'm his
          legal guardian.

Morty shows him his I.D. The Desk Sergeant puts a clipboard
in front of him. Morty feels his pockets for a pen.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          You got a pen?

The Sergeant takes out an expensive looking fountain pen from
his breast pocket, hands it to Morty. Morty signs the
paperwork. The Desk Sergeant signals an OFFICER behind him.

                    DESK SERGEANT
          The kid with the hearse.

                    MORTY
          You try to bring 'em up right. But
          I'm a single guy, what do I know?
          He's a teenager. I'll make sure it
          doesn't happen again.

Morty pockets the pen and takes out a brochure from Darkside
Tours and a "Franchise Certificate." He hands it over.

                     MORTY (CONT'D)
          Sergeant. You look like you're
          about ready to retire. You ever
          thought about investing in a
          franchise?

                    DESK SERGEANT
              (deadpan)
          My pen.

                    MORTY
          Right. You keep this and think
          about it. Have a good night now,
          sergeant.
                                                        26.



Morty gives the pen back. He walks over to a bench in the
lobby. Cody is being uncuffed by an officer. He sits next to
several Hollywood criminal types.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
              (mock anger)
          What were you thinking? These guys
          wouldn't catch you? They're L.A.'s
          finest.

                    CODY
              (playing along)
          Yeah, I guess I was pretty stupid.

                    MORTY
          Damn straight. Thanks, officer.
          Here, take one of these for
          yourself.

Morty hands the officer a brochure. The officer walks away.

                    CODY
              (dropping the act)
          You missed your calling. You
          should've been an actor.

                    MORTY
          There's no money in it.

                    CODY
          How're you feeling?

                    MORTY
          My stomach. You know. Nothing a
          little Bromo can't cure.

Behind them, two officers bring in the Homeless Man, last
seen at Houdini's ruins, to the front desk. He's handcuffed,
and has a bloody wad of cotton in his cheek. The man pulls
away from the two officers. Morty and Cody turn to watch.

                    HOMELESS MAN
          I'm telling you, this guy came out
          of a tree up at Houdini's place and
          tore my gold tooth out!

The Desk Sergeant raises his eyebrows at the two arresting
officers.

                    DESK SERGEANT
          Can you give a description?
                                                             27.



                         HOMELESS MAN
               He was about three feet tall. He
               had on a green suit, striped socks
               and a little hat.

     The Desk Sergeant nods. He's heard it all.

                         DESK SERGEANT
               And I bet he had little gold
               buckles on his little black shoes.

                         HOMELESS MAN
               That's right, that's right!

                         DESK SERGEANT
                   (to the officers)
               Happy St. Patrick's Day, boys. Get
               him out of here!

     The Homeless Man continues to scream as he is led away to a
     cell.

                         HOMELESS MAN
               He was real! Listen to me!

                         CODY
               You see that? Keep drinking, you'll
               start seeing little green men too.

                         MORTY
               Don't be a wiseass.

     Morty and Cody exit the station.

31   EXT. THIRD STREET PROMENADE - NIGHT                          31

     The Leprechaun stands in an elaborately designed circle,
     drawn with chalk, on a sidewalk. He finishes scrawling
     strange Gaelic lettering in it. He stands up, in the middle
     of the circle and holds his shelaleigh in front of him.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Spin, spin, me little guide, point
               the way to me fresh young bride.

     The Leprechaun tosses the shelaleigh up in front of him. It
     hangs in mid air, spinning, like the needle of a compass. It
     then STOPS IN THE AIR, pointing in a particular direction.

     Suddenly, a QUARTER is plunked down into the middle of the
     circle. The Leprechaun looks up.
                                                             28.



     LEPRECHAUN'S POV

     Amidst the hustle and bustle of street traffic and other
     street performers, the Leprechaun sees a TALENT AGENT staring
     down at him. The Leprechaun holds up the quarter with
     disdain.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               What is this?

                         TALENT AGENT
               It's a quarter. What'd you expect?

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Your gold would be nice.

     The Leprechaun notices a fat, shiny gold ring on the Agent's
     finger. The Agent pulls out a business card and holds it in
     front of the Leprechaun.

                         TALENT AGENT

     The Leprechaun reaches for the card, but tears off the
     Agent's' ringed finger. The Agent holds his bloodied hand in
     horror as the Leprechaun shakes the ring off of the
     dismembered finger.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Methinks, I'm going to like this

32   INT. DARKSIDE TOURS OFFICE/APARTMENT - NIGHT              32

     Cody, glumly, flips through some photos. They depict Cody and
     Bridget together, having fun (eating at a restaurant, at the
     beach, horsing around outside of school, etc.).

     Cody tosses the pictures aside and turns on the television.

     ANGLE ON TELEVISION

     An old romantic black and white movie. A tuxedoed gentleman
     kisses a beautiful woman.

     Cody stares at the screen, and the man and woman engaged in
     the kiss BECOME IAN AND BRIDGET. Cody turns the TV off with a
     loud hit. He approaches Morty.
                                                        29.



Morty stands at the front door. There's a LOUD KNOCKING at
the door. Morty stares eagerly at his wristwatch, ignoring
the knocking. Cody approaches him.

                    CODY
          Morty, what are you...?

                    MORTY
          Shh!

Morty's watch BEEPS. He grins widely and opens the door. A
PIZZA DELIVERY MAN wearing a p1astic green derby stands at
the door. Morty grabs the box and points to his watch.

                    MORTY (CONT' D)
              (to the pizza man)
          Thirty-one minutes. It's free!

Morty slams the door in the pizza guy's face.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          Nothing tastes better than a free
          pizza. Now if I could only figure
          out a way to get free beer...

                    CODY
          Everything's a scam with you, isn't
          it?

                    MORTY
              (proudly)
          Damn right. Have some pizza.

                    CODY
          I'm not hungry.

                    MORTY
          What's wrong with you?

                    CODY
          I think I really blew it with
          Bridget today.

                    MORTY
          She's a great girl! How could you
          do such a thing?

                    CODY
          Well, you got drunk, so I decided
          to break our date and give the
          stupid tour.
                                                             30.



                         MORTY
               You did the right thing. You went
               for the cash. Women'll get you into
               trouble every time, kid. Forget
               her. Here, let's play some cards.

     Morty pulls out a deck of cards and deals three cards, face
     down, right in front of Cody. He moves the three cards
     around.

                         MORTY (CONT'D)
               Remember, keep your eye on the red.

                         CODY
               Three card monte?

                         MORTY
               It's the perfect game.
                   (almost reverently)
               The chump gets lured in and forgets
               everything else. All he sees is the
               money before him. You see that look
               in his eye and you know he's a dead
               man. Then it's time to make your
               move.

     Cody gets up from the table and heads for the door.

                         MORTY (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                         CODY
               I've been a chump. It's time to
               make my move.

33   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                                        33

     Ian's car is parked in the driveway to Bridget's house, a
     California craftsman with a porch. Bridget walks away from
     the car to her front door.

                         BRIDGET
               Thanks for the ride.

                         IAN
               Hey, wait up! You said your parents
               weren't home.

                         BRIDGET
               So?
                                                           31.



                    IAN
          Well, aren't you going to invite me
          in?

He moves in to kiss her. Bridget pulls back.

                    BRIDGET
          Ian, you know I'm going out with
          Cody.

                    IAN
          I thought you guys called it quits.

                    BRIDGET
          Wrong. Good night, Ian.

Ian puts his arm in front of the door, blocking her entry.

                    IAN
          Just a second! I took the night off
          for you. And what about those chili
          dogs?

                    BRIDGET
          Ian, you better go.

Ian moves in again. The CAMERA CRANES UP, revealing the
Leprechaun, hidden, high in a tree, watching the whole
scenario. His eyes narrow, angrily.

                    IAN
          Come on, just for a couple of
          minutes.

                       BRIDGET
          I said no!

Ian grabs her elbow and tries to pull her in for a kiss.

                    IAN
          I get it. You're just a tease!

                    BRIDGET
          Tease this!

Bridget elbows Ian hard, in the ribs, and pushes past him
inside. She slams the door in his face.

                    IAN
          Stuck up bitch.
                                                             32.



     Ian walks back to his car. Suddenly, the garage door flies
     open. Ian jumps with a start. A shapely figure stands in the
     shadows of the garage. Ian moves towards it.

35   INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER                                 35

                          IAN
               Bridget?

     And indeed, Bridget steps forward from the shadows. She has a
     seductive grin on her face.

                         IAN (CONT'D)
               How'd you get in here?

                         BRIDGET
               Ian, I'm so sorry. I don't know
               what I was thinking.

     Ian takes all of this in.

                         IAN
               So what are you thinking now?

                         BRIDGET
               I was thinking maybe I could make
               it up to you?

     Bridget starts to unbutton her blouse.

                         IAN
               That's a start.

     Ian smoothes back his hair.

     Behind a workbench, the Leprechaun watches, menacingly. Ian
     stops to watch Bridget undress.

                         BRIDGET
               Well, are you just going to stand
               there?

     Ian moves toward Bridget. The Leprechaun giggles. Ian turns
     his head.

                         IAN
               You hear that?

     Bridget's arms reach out seductively, drawing him closer.
                                                        33.



                    BRIDGET
          Ian, come on.

                    IAN
          Why don't we go inside? This place
          is giving me the creeps.

                    BRIDGET
          I may change my mind again.

Bridget opens her shirt. Ian gets closer. He kneels down and
begins to kiss her stomach.

CLOSE ON THE LEPRECHAUN

                    LEPRECHAUN
              (quietly)
          The vision before you appears to be
          true, but the Leprechaun's magic
          fools humans like you.

ON IAN

He is about to kiss Bridget's breasts --

                     BRIDGET
          Kiss me.

                    LEPRECHAUN'S POV
          And here we see that Ian is
          actually kissing the handle of a
          hand mower, suspended in the air,
          hanging upside down. The blades
          begin to spin treacherously.

CLOSE ON IAN

His face is millimeters from the razor sharp, twirling
blades. Just as he goes in for the "kiss of death," the
CAMERA PANS to the wall. We see, IN SHADOW, the deadly moment
of contact. Ian lets out a horrifying GURGLE.

FROM BEHIND THE WORKBENCH

The Leprechaun steps into the light and looks at his
handiwork (which lies O.S.).

                    LEPRECHAUN
              (in Bridget's voice)
          Was it as good for you as it was
          for me?
              (beat, in his own voice)
          You shouldn't fool with me lass.
                                                             34.



     The Leprechaun turns toward the house with a grin.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               She sneezes once, she sneezes
               twice, she'll be me bride when she
               sneezes thrice.

     He walks off.

36   INT. KITCHEN - LATER                                      36

     Bridget is at the fridge, getting a soda. The doorbell RINGS.
     She looks towards it.

                         BRIDGET
                   (to herself)
               Ian, you idiot. You just don't give
               up.

     The doorbell RINGS again.

37   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER                                  37

     Bridget strides toward the door.

                            BRIDGET
               Forget it!

     The front doorbell RINGS a third time.

                         BRIDGET
               Get out of here, or I'm going to
               call the police.

     Bridget opens the door. Cody stands in the doorway.

                         CODY
               You really are mad at me.

     Cody removes a bouquet of roses from behind his back.

                         CODY (CONT'D)
               Trick or treat.

     Bridget is relieved that it's Cody.

                         BRIDGET
               Wrong holiday.

     He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a green carnation.
     He sticks it in with the roses.
                                                        35.



                    CODY
          I got it covered.

Bridget finally smiles.

                    CODY (CONT'D)
          Can I come in?

Bridget opens the door and Cody enters.

                    BRIDGET
          This is a surprise.

                     CODY
          I was really a jerk today. Here,
          take them.

Bridget takes the flowers.

                    BRIDGET
          They're beautiful.

                    CODY
          Not as beautiful as you. Do you
          forgive me?

Cody is getting to her.

                     BRIDGET
          Cody!

Cody looks at her, expectantly.

                     CODY
          Yeah...?

                    BRIDGET
          I can never stay mad at you.

                    CODY
          I've learned my lesson. From now
          on, I promise, nothing's going to
          come between us.

They embrace. They do not see the Leprechaun, behind them,
crawl into the room through an open window, and hide behind a
couch.

                    BRIDGET
          Let's go put these in some water.
                                                             36.



     Bridget buries her face in the flowers and inhales deeply.
     The Leprechaun blows softly in Bridget's direction. Bridget
     sneezes for the first time.

                         CODY
               Great. I buy you roses and you're
               allergic to them.

                         BRIDGET
               I'm not allergic. Come on.

     Bridget and Cody walk off toward the kitchen.

38   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      38

     Bridget goes to the sink and fills up a vase with water. She
     finds a note attached to the flowers and opens it.

                         BRIDGET
               "Cody". A man of few words.

                         CODY
               I didn't know if you'd be home.
               Didn't want you to think some
               stalker left you flowers.

     Bridget laughs and sneezes a second time.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
               Gesundheit. Maybe we should put
               those in another room, or
               something.

                         BRIDGET
               It's not the flowers. And besides,
               even if it was, it wouldn't matter.
               I love them.

     Cody smiles. Bridget sneezes a third time.

                            CODY
               God bl...

     Suddenly, the telephone cord from a wall phone wraps tightly
     around Cody's face, gagging him.

                         BRIDGET
               Oh my God, Cody! What the hell...

     Cody struggles with the cord around his neck. Bridget
     frantically tries to help him when the Leprechaun's laugh
     diverts her attention. She turns around and sees the
     Leprechaun standing in the kitchen doorway. Bridget screams.
                                                                37.



                            LEPRECHAUN
                  I've searched this fair land far
                  and wide, at last I've got me
                  Leprechaun bride!

     Cody, meanwhile, has grabbed a knife off the counter and cuts
     the cord from his face.

                            CODY
                  Who are you?! How did you get in
                  here...

     Holding the knife, Cody charges toward the Leprechaun.

     The Leprechaun glances up toward a rack of heavy copper pots
     hanging from the ceiling. The pots suddenly come CRASHING
     down upon Cody, knocking him out.

                            BRIDGET
                  Cody!

     The Leprechaun moves toward Bridget. She dashes past the
     Leprechaun, screaming.

                            BRIDGET (CONT'D)
                  Somebody, help!

39   INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                39

     Bridget runs toward the door. The Leprechaun looks at it, and
     the locks bolt themselves. Bridget tries to unlock the door,
     but all the locks are jammed shut.

     QUICK CUTS

     One by one, all the windows slam shut.

     Bridget is trapped in the room with the little demon. She
     turns to him fearfully.

                            BRIDGET
                  Please... what do you want...?

     The Leprechaun conjures his pot of gold (it hovers in the
     air), and rummages through it.

                            LEPRECHAUN
                  It's not a proper wedding without a
                  wedding ring, is it?

     The Leprechaun finds what he is looking for: a large gold
     shackle with a small padlock on it.
                                                              38.



                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               With this ring, I thee wed!

     The Leprechaun tosses the shackle towards Bridget. It flies
     through the air and clasps around Bridget's neck. The padlock
     locks.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               I may now kiss the bride.

     The Leprechaun twists his fist.

     CLOSE ON BRIDGET

     She struggles with the shackle as she is slowly, magically,
     dragged across the floor toward the Leprechaun.

     WIDER

     Bridget is at the Leprechaun's feet. He releases his magic
     grasp on her. She slowly rises.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               That's a good girl.

     Bridget quickly knocks over the pot of gold. The pieces go
     flying across the room.

                          LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               Me gold!

     One coin lands on its side and rolls across the room, into
     the kitchen.

40   INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                    40

     The gold coin brushes against Cody's hand. It SPARKLES
     MAGICALLY and Cody wakes up. He takes the coin and stares at
     it as he regains consciousness. Suddenly, a HAND grabs Cody's
     shoulder. We PULL BACK to reveal -- it's Bridget.

                         BRIDGET
               Are you okay?

                         CODY
               Yeah, fine. Let's get the hell out
               of here!

     Cody grabs Bridget and they rush into the living room.
                                                             39.



41   INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               41

     The Leprechaun is on the floor, gathering the last of his
     gold trinkets and putting them in the pot.

                         BRIDGET
               He's bolted all the doors and
               windows!

                          CODY
               So?

     Cody grabs a chair and throws it through a window.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
               Come on!

     They begin to step through the window when IAN'S DEAD BODY,
     hanging from a ledge above the window, swings down, blocking
     their path.

     Bridget screams -- and then the Leprechaun appears right
     behind her. He grabs her hand and pulls her away, powerfully.

                         BRIDGET
               Cody, help me!

     The Leprechaun takes a step forward.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               A thousand years ago, a man stopped
               me from taking me bride. I'll not
               let it happen again.

     Cody turns to the fireplace and grabs a fire poker. He throws
     the poker at the Leprechaun. Just as it's about to strike
     him, the Leprechaun snatches it in mid-air.

     Cody looks on in fear when... the Leprechaun lets out a
     painful screech. His hand, holdinq the fireplace poker,
     starts to burn. (It's wrought iron.) The Leprechaun takes
     Bridget's hand. Toqether, they magicallv disappear.

                         BRIDGET
                   (as she disappears)
               Please, Cody...

     And they both vanish into thin air. Suddenly, the front door
     OPENS and SLAMS SHUT. Cody rushes to the door and goes
     outside.
                                                             40.



42   EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT                                  42

     Cody emerges from the house.

                         CODY
               Bridget!! Bridget!!

     CAMERA CRANES UP as Cody runs down the empty streets.

     CAMERA PANS TO BLACK

     and in the black, we go to...

50   INT. LEPRECHAUN'S LAIR - NIGHT                            50

     Bridget steps forward in the darkness.

     The lair is a cavernous pit of hell. The Leprechaun forces
     Bridget forward, prodding her with his shelaleigh. He holds a
     lantern up, lighting the way. Cobwebs dangle from the
     ceilings above, clinging to Bridget's hair and body.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               It ain't much, but it's home.

     Bridget brushes off the webs in disgust and moves on.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               I built it all these years, while
               I've been waiting for this birthday
               and...for you.

     Passageways lead off in many different directions. The
     Leprechaun seems to know his way, but to the visitor, the
     trek is disorienting. It's as if you were in a gigantic maze.
     The Leprechaun blows out the lantern and puts it down. The
     passageways have an eerie glow to them.
                                                             41.


     They are lit by glass globes filled with FIREFLIES, attached
     to the walls, like ghastly, glowing sconces. They pulsate
     with a green luminescence. They exit the tunnel and are in...

51   OMITTED                                                   51

52   INT. INNER LAIR - FOLLOWING                               52

     The"center" of the Leprechaun's home. Tree roots, of many
     sizes, are woven in and out of the ceiling above. The entire
     cavern is damp with slime. Several pitch black passageways
     lead from this inner cavern. One area has a small cobbler's
     work bench, and a large mound of shoes in various stages of
     construction sits next to it. Another area has a little
     stove, a little table, and a little bar.

     In another area is a twisted canopy bed made from thorny tree
     roots from floor to ceiling. It's not designed for comfort.
     Instead, it has a sadistic, horrific quality.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               What do you think of your bridal
               chamber?

                         BRIDGET
               It's... it's awful!

                         LEPRECHAUN
               I know, it lacks a woman's touch.
               But you'll change that. Well, shall
               we...?

     The Leprechaun looks toward the bed. Bridget starts to break
     down.

                         BRIDGET
               Oh God, please...

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Now, now, my dear. I've waited one
               thousand years for this night! But
               it was worth it, just to claim an
               O'Day for me bride.

                         BRIDGET
                   (hopeful)
               My name's not O'Day! You made a
               mistake.
                                                              42.



                          LEPRECHAUN
                    (reprimanding)
                O'Day's in your blood.
                    (he inhales)
                I can smell it. I know what you
                need! A little Irish whiskey to put
                you in the mood.

      Bridget looks around. She sees the "bar" is a small distance
      away.

                          BRIDGET
                    (frightened)
                Okay.

      The Leprechaun turns his back to Bridget and walks toward the
      bar. She catches sight of a nearby stone. When the Leprechaun
      has reached the bar, she carefully picks up the stone. The
      Leprechaun pours himself a small tumbler of whiskey. OVER HIS
      SHOULDER, Bridget carefully approaches him, the stone raised
      and ready to strike. The Leprechaun puts the glass to his
      lips and drinks it.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Ah, that's the stuff.

      BANG! Bridget brings the stone down upon his head. He slumps
      to the ground. Bridget turns on her heels and takes off. She
      takes off down a tunnel.

52A   INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                 52A

      Bridget runs down this narrow corridor. She looks over her
      shoulder and when she looks back ahead - ZING! - Bridget is
      face to face with a SKELETON, embedded in the wall. It wears
      the same neck shackle that William O'Day wore in the *
      opening. Bridget screams. She backs up -- right into -- the
      Leprechaun.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Ah, a little family reunion.You
                have his cheekbones!

      The Leprechaun laughs.

                          BRIDGET
                No!

                          LEPRECHAUN
                I'm glad I have a frisky lass!
                    (very sinister)
                I like to play games, too. Let's
                play... Bedtime for Bridget!
                                                              43.



      The Leprechaun whacks his shelaleigh against the side wall.
      Bridget hears a NOISE and looks behind her.

      BRIDGET'S POV - THE STAINED BURLAP SHEET

      that was lying on the canopy bed has come to life and rushes
      toward Bridget.

      The sheet wraps around Bridget, binding her like a mummy. In
      this restrained position, she's pulled down onto the tunnel
      floor, but lands on...

52B   INT. INNER LAIR - NIGHT                                  52B

      The canopy bed! Bridget screams.

                          BRIDGET
                How did we get here?

      The Leprechaun walks up to the side of the bed.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                The leprechaun's home has many
                surprises.

      Bridget cries out in anguish. As the Leprechaun approaches
      her, she tries, unsuccessfully, to kick him (she's still
      bound in the sheet). The Leprechaun is amused by this.

                          LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
                That's no way to treat the father
                of your children. Oh, didn't I
                mention? You'll be bearing me wee
                ones, soon.

                          BRIDGET
                Get me out of this!

                            LEPRECHAUN
                Silence!!

      Bridget quiets down. The Leprechaun holds up his sharp, razor-
      like fingernails. He slices through the burlap, covering
      Bridget's midsection, and exposes her bare white belly. The
      Leprechaun licks his lips, as he puts his bony hand on her
      soft skin. She cringes in disgust, trying to pull away, but
      she can't.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                I'm going to have to make a few
                alterations. But, afterward you'll
                be able to bear a full litter.
                          (MORE)
                                                        44.
                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
              (looking at his
               fingernails)
          These will need sharpening.

                    BRIDGET
              (terrified)
          Why... why are you doing this...?

The Leprechaun runs the back of his hand along Bridget's tear-
soaked cheeks.

                     LEPRECHAUN
          Don't worry your little head about
          it. You'll get used to the pain.
              (beat)
          Aye, we'll have to make some
          changes to your face as well. Tis a
          fair face, but the wee ones won't
          suckle if you don't look like them.
          They can be very demanding at
          times.
              (smiling a sick smile)
          Many changes. Many changes.

Bridget sobs uncontrollably.

                       LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          Stop that!

                    BRIDGET
          I just want to go home.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          But you are home; my sweet.
              (serious)
          And home is where you'll stay.

The Leprechaun turns around -- when he turns back to Bridget,
he is holding his pot of gold. He holds it over Bridget.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          Something new, something old, let's
          be together, on Leprechaun gold!

The Leprechaun pours out his pot of gold on top of Bridget.
He gets on the bed next to her, alternatively stroking
Bridget and the gold. He continues stroking... when something
seems wrong. He frantically starts rummaging through the
gold, looking for something.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          It's missing. A gold shilling.
                    (MORE)
                                                        45.
                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          It's not here. It's missing! I must
          have it back.

The Leprechaun gathers up his gold and makes the pot
disappear. He heads out.

                    BRIDGET
          Don't leave me tied here! Please! I
          promise I'll do...
              (getting an idea)
          I want to make myself look pretty
          for our wedding night. I want to
          look pretty for you. You're my
          husband now. I want to please you.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          That you will.

The Leprechaun throws A DRESS at Bridget (we don't need to
see him "conjure" it).

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          Here's a proper wedding dress for
          you. See that you're wearin' it
          when I return.

The Leprecbaun approaches Bridget. He bends down, inches from
her face.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          But before I go... Kiss me, I'm
          Irish.

The Leprechaun then licks her with his extremely long, clammy
tongue. Bridget endures the ordeal as best she can.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          That's just a taste of things to
          come.

The Leprechaun waves his arm and releases her from the burlap
sheet. She jumps to her feet.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          I'm going to get me gold coin.

He turns to her with an almost affectionate smile.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          You'll try to escape, but it's
          hopeless.
                                                                 46.



      He laughs as he disappears down the dark passageway. Bridget
      waits to make sure that he's gone, then wipes the
      Leprechaun's slime off her cheek. She runs to the passageway,
      where the Leprechaun exited.

52C   INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                         52C

      She sees light around the corner. She turns a corner, into
      the light, and...

      EXTREME CLOSEUP ON BRIDGET'S FACE -- a stunned expression.

      SNAP ZOOM OUT and Bridget is standing in the middle of...

52D   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    52D

      her own living room! She looks around.

                            BRIDGET
                Cody...?

      A flashing red and blue police light hits the windows,
      indicating a police car parked outside the house. She rushes
      to the front door, opens it, steps outside, and finds herself
      back in...

52E   INT. INNER LAIR - NIGHT                                     52E

      SNAP ZOOM OUT of a CLOSEUP ON BRIDGET'S FACE. A replica of
      her front door is now at the mouth of the tunnel. She looks
      back at the door, and it slides back into the tunnel,
      vanishing in the shadows.

      Bridget screams in frustration and sinks to the floor in
      despair.

      ON THE FLOOR WITH BRIDGET. She takes a few deep breaths,
      pulling herself together. In the dirt and earth-covered floor
      of the inner lair, Bridget spots some small stones. She gets
      an idea, and starts to collect them.

                                               CUT TO:

53    EXT. BRIDGET'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT                          53

      Several police cars, with lights flashing, are parked in
      front of the house. POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES fill the
      crime scene. Attendants are loading a body bag into the back
      of the coroner's station wagon.

      TILT UP to reveal the Leprechaun, hiding behind the chimney
      of Bridget's house. He watches the crime scene below.
                                                             47.



                         LEPRECHAUN
                   (angrily)
               I've searched the house for me gold
               shilling. The fool that holds it,
               is due for a killing.

     The Leprechaun spots a young woman DETECTIVE (late twenties)
     walking away from the front door, holding Cody's bouquet of
     flowers and his note.

54   EXT. FRONT LAWN - SAME TIME                                  54

     The detective joins her male PARTNER, (early thirties), on
     the front lawn.

                         DETECTIVE
               I think we have a suspect. I found
               these flowers and this note in the
               kitchen.

     She shows the card with Cody's name on it.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
               Cody Ingels. Parents told me he's
               the girl's boyfriend. They said he
               was bad news. Seems like they had a
               fight this afternoon and he brought
               her roses.

     LEPRECHAUN'S P.O.V. FROM ROOF.

     From behind the chimney, the Leprechaun sees the Detective
     hold up the flowers.

                         PARTNER
               So he comes over to kiss and make
               up, and finds his girlfriend home
               with our man in the body bag.

                         DETECTIVE
               He snaps. There's a struggle in the
               living room and the kitchen. Does a
               slice 'n dice on the guy, and
               kidnaps the girl. Crime of passion.

55   EXT. FRONT LAWN - SAME TIME                                  55

     The Detective hands the card to her Partner.

                         PARTNER
               This his address?
                                                                48.



     All of a sudden, a wind rips the note from the Partner's
     grasp. It flies up and over the roof, to the other side.

                         DETECTIVE
               It was.

     The Partner goes around back, to get the card.

56   EXT. BRIDGET'S HOUSE - ROOF - SAME TIME                      56

     The note lands in the Leprechaun's hand. His eyes narrow on
     Cody's name and address. He knows who has his coin.

     HOLD ON the word "CODY" as

57   EXT. "DARKSIDE" - NIGHT                                      57

     Cody walks carefully towards Darkside Tours' offices. He
     rounds the corner and stops in his tracks.

     Outside the front door of "Darkside Tours, Morty talks to two
     POLICE OFFICERS. The officers' backs are to Cody. Morty has a
     direct eye line to Cody. He subtly signals Cody to stay back.
     Cody falls back into the shadows of the alley behind the
     building.

     Morty goes inside. The policemen leave.

58   INT. DARKSIDE TOURS OFFICE/APARTMENT - LATER                 58

     Morty comes in the front door. Out of nowhere... Cody
     appears, frantically. Morty jumps back in shock.

                         CODY
               Morty!

                          MORTY
               My God, kid!
                   (beat)
               How the hell'd you get in?

                         CODY
               Fire escape.

                         MORTY
                   (urgently)
               Are you okay?

                         CODY
                   (breathless)
               Yeah, I'm fine. You're not going to
               believe this, but...
                                                             49.



                         MORTY
               Listen, kid, the cops are looking
               everywhere for you. They found some
               dead kid at Bridget's house, the
               girl is gone, and everyone thinks
               that YOU did it.

                         CODY
               Me?! That's crazy!

                         MORTY
               That's what I told the police. So
               what the hell happened?

                         CODY
                   (dead serious)
               A leprechaun did it.

     Beat.

                         MORTY
               Maybe I should call the cops.

                         CODY
               Morty, look at this!

     Cody holds out the coin.

                                                 CUT TO:

59   INT. DARKSIDE TOURS' DINING TABLE - LATER                 59

     CLOSEUP ON the gold coin, next to a picture of the same one,
     in an old reference book about folklore and mythology, opened
     to a chapter about Leprechauns. (The front cover could be the
     same one from the Main Title sequence, but the pages inside
     will, of course, be different.)

                         MORTY (O.S.)
               So, all right. You've got a gold
               coin. It's old and it looks like
               the one in the book.

     Cody and Morty sit at a small round table. It is covered with
     old books and magazine articles. Morty examines the coin. The
     conversation is heated.

                         MORTY
               It's probably worth some cash.But,
               this Leprechaun story...

                         CODY
               Gimme that thing!
                                                        50.



Cody snatches the coin from Morty's hands. Morty looks at
Cody, noticing he's a little jumpy.

                    MORTY
              (seriously)
          Listen, Cody, if somehow you've
          taken some drugs or something,
          you'd tell me, right?

                    CODY
              (pleading)
          Morty, you've got to believe me! I
          saw a real leprechaun!

                    MORTY
          Like three wishes, give me your
          gold and all that? Get outta here,
          kid. It's a fairy tale!

                    CODY
              (adamantly)
          This is no fairy tale! I saw what
          it can do. Look, look here.
              (reading)
          "Leprechauns are devious
          creatures." They're conniving. Says
          here, they live by trickery. Even
          get pleasure out of it.

                    MORTY
              (to himself, worried)
          Maybe I should've kept you away
          from all this supernatural stuff.

                    CODY
          He dropped a rack of pots on my
          head!

Morty starts to get up.

                    MORTY
          Oh. Now I'm convinced.

Cody pulls him back down to the table, anxiously showing him
something in the book.

                    CODY
          Look. "They possess telekinetic
          powers. They can turn invisible at
          will. They are masters of illusion.
          Both leprechauns and fairies can
          only be harmed by wrought iron..."
                                                         51.



Morty impatiently grabs the book and flips through it.

                    MORTY
              (facetiously)
          Right, right. They're greedy as all
          hell. They like to make shoes. They
          love to drink. They've got their
          little pot of gold and if you catch
          them, they grant you three wishes
          and all that crap. I've read that
          stuff. It's made up. It's not real.
          I use junk like this to sucker the
          tourists.

Cody disregards Morty and pulls the book back.

                    CODY
          "On his thousandth birthday, the
          leprechaun laid claim to the lass
          and, by daybreak, she was never
          heard from again." (beat,
          fearfully) That's why he came for
          Bridget.

Morty closes the book in Cody's face and tosses it over his
shoulder.

                    MORTY
              (angered)
          I should've returned this damn book
          to the library five years ago! Now,
          I don't know what you saw, but
          leprechauns don't exist!

The lights in the office go out.

Without warning, the Leprechaun drops down from above, behind
Morty. He stands on a cabinet, holding his shelaleigh. Morty
is unaware.

                    LEPRECHAUN
              (angrily)
          What's that you say? Leprechauns
          don't exist?

Morty spins around and comes face to face with the
Leprechaun. WHACK! The Leprechaun winds up and swings,
hitting Morty in the face, knocking him backward with the
blow.

Morty falls down, dazed. He knocks over a stack of "franchise
certificates". They go flying. The Leprechaun approaches
Cody, menacingly.
                                                        52.



                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          I want me gold!

Cody backs up, toward a bookcase in the bedroom. All of a
sudden, a book flies off the shelf, at the far end of the
bookcase, and just misses Cody's head. Cody stops in his
tracks. Two more books, in rapid succession, fly toward Cody.
A third, a little closer. A fourth. Then, the bookcase fires
all of its books --a thunderstorm of books firing at our
hero. Cody hits the deck, covering his head. Books land all
over him, until the shelves are empty. On the other side of
the bookcase stands the Leprechaun. His eyes peer out between
the shelves. (This bookcase has no "back" to it.)

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          I'll not say it again. You know
          what I want.

                    CODY
              (gathering his courage)
          I'll trade you the coin for
          Bridget.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          A fair trade, lad. Just give me the
          coin and she's yours. I promise.

CLOSE ANGLE

The Leprechaun has his gnarled fingers crossed behind his
back.

BACK TO SCENE

Cody takes out the coin and holds it out to the Leprechaun.

Suddenly, the shelf is pushed over, onto the Leprechaun. It's
Morty. He runs and pulls up Cody by the shoulders.

                    CODY
          Why'd you do that!?

                    MORTY
          You can't trust a Leprechaun!
          Didn't you read the book?

The bookcase begins to RATTLE.

                    CODY
          Let's get out of here!

Cody heads toward the front door. Morty grabs him.
                                                             53.



                         MORTY
               It's crawling with cops!

                         CODY
               The fire escape.

     They go for the fire escape. Cody looks behind him, making
     sure the Leprechaun is not there.

61   OMITTED                                                      61

62   INT. DARKSIDE TOURS - AT THE FIRE ESCAPE - FOLLOWING         62

     Morty is at an open window. Security bars are seen on the
     other side. Morty pulls on a lever by the windowsill, and the
     security bars swing open. Morty climbs out onto the fire
     escape. Cody follows. Cody's almost all the way through,
     when, the window slams down, trapping Cody's foot inside the
     room. Cody falls onto the fire escape.

63   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - FOLLOWING                                 63

     Cody looks back at the window. On the other side, the
     Leprechaun appears.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Now you've done it! You've welched
               on a Leprechaun!

     Cody pulls with all his might and gets his foot free. He
     falls back, onto the fire escape. The window flies open. From
     within, the Leprechaun reaches for Cody.

     Thinking quickly, Cody kicks the bars, that are hinged to the
     window frame, shutting them in place. The Leprechaun grabs
     the security bars. His hands singe, letting out wisps of
     smoke. The security bars are wrought iron! The Leprechaun
     lets out a yell and retreats into the darkness of the
     Darkside office. Cody and Morty book down the fire escape.

                         MORTY
               That's one pissed off Leprechaun.
               Quick, to Brennen's!

                         CODY
               Great idea! It'll be packed!
                                                             54.



64   EXT. BRENNEN'S PUB - FOLLOWING                               64

     ody and Morty run from the alleyway, behind the Darkside
     Of�ice, across the street, to Brennen's. They push throuqh a
     crowd of people to head inside. A particularly inebriated
     customer, MAT, is being "escorted" out by a bouncer.

                         MAT
               Every day should be St. Patrick's
               Day!

                         CODY
               D'you see what happened when he
               touched the bars?.

                         MORTY
                   (harried)
               Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wrought iron.
               Keep moving.

65   INT. BRENNEN'S PUB - FOLLOWING                               65

     Cody and Morty come inside. The smoky bar is crowded with
     ROWDY DRUNK PATRONS of all sorts. The PUNK GRUNGE, some with
     spiked green-dyed mohawks, drink green beer next to a group
     of FAT OLDER MEN with gin noses and smoker's growls. A
     TOOTHLESS BAWDY HOOKER sits on one of their laps laughing
     hysterically. The BARFLIES stare out, drunkenly, over their
     shots of Bushmill. The jukebox blares. The partying has hit a
     fevered pitch. The scene is a cross between a Bosch painting
     and a Charles Bukowski novel.

     Suddenly the SAME TWO COPS who were seen talking to Morty
     outside of the Darkside offices come perilously close to
     Cody. Morty quickly grabs Cody by the collar and pulls him
     out of the cops' range of vision.

                         MORTY
               Time to take a leak.

     OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM

     Cody and Morty are about to head inside, when ANOTHER
     UNIFORMED COP comes into the men's room. Morty quickly turns
     around with Cody, so his back is to the cop, and then fully
     ducks inside the bathroom.

66   INT. BATHROOM - FOLLOWING                                    66

     Cody and Morty get inside. (A partition stands on the inside
     of the door, to keep people outside from looking in.) Morty
     checks underneath the stall. They're alone. Morty's mind is
     racing.
                                                           55.



                    CODY
          So, how're we going to get
          Bridget...?

                    MORTY
          Let me see that coin again.

Cody hands Morty the coin and he inspects it, engrossed.

                    MORTY (CONT'D)
          Son a bitch is real. I actually saw
          him.

Morty absentmindedly begins to put the coin in his pocket.
Cody grabs it from him.

                    CODY
          Morty!

                    MORTY
          Sorry, kid. Force of habit.

                    CODY
              (mad)
          Every second we waste... who knows
          what he's doing to her!

                    MORTY
          Don't worry, kid. I know how much
          she means to you. We're going to
          catch that little bastard. We're
          smarter. I know what I'm doing.

Morty peeks out the door, making sure the coast is clear. He
begins to head out.

                    CODY
          Where you going?

                    MORTY
          I'm getting a drink.

Morty exits. Cody sighs and goes over to a urinal. He's in
the midst of his business when... the door opens. The sound
of shoes, CLICKING on the floor, is heard. Cody freezes in
place. There is someone entering the bathroom. Slowly, Cody
looks below the partition. A pair of black, square-toed shoes
are seen...and they have gold buckles. Cody backs up, further
into the bathroom. The one window is too high up. He looks
around for an escape. There is none. Cody waits for the
inevitable. The Leprechaun's shadow is seen on the wall. The
shoes come around the partition.
                                                             56.



     The Leprechaun steps out into the light. It's not the
     Leprechaun from hell. This guy is an African American LITTLE
     PERSON, dressed up to look like a leprechaun. He wears a
     "Kiss me I'm Irish" button, on the lapel of his green coat
     and a "CELEBRATE ST. PATRICK'S AT BRENNEN'S" t-shirt. He
     carries a plastic pot o' gold in one hand. Cody is relieved.

                         LITTLE PERSON
               Yo man, want me gold?

     The little person takes a handful of the gold coins from the
     plastic pot o' gold and holds them out to Cody. Cody
     hesitates.

                           LITTLE PERSON (CONT'D)
               Take 'em.

     Cody takes the gold coins.

                         CODY
                   (puzzled)
               Thanks.

                         LITTLE PERSON
               It's real milk chocolate.

     Cody unwraps one of the coins. Under the gold wrapping is
     chocolate. He pops the chocolate in his mouth and looks at
     the fake leprechaun, who smiles back. The African American
     Little Person has a gold tooth. Something clicks in Cody's
     head. He rushes from the bathroom.

67   INT. BRENNEN'S PUB - FOLLOWING                               67

     Cody steps out of the bathroom and bumps into... The
     Leprechaun. The Leprechaun turns around. Again, it's a LITTLE
     PERSON dressed up for the festivities.

                           CODY
               Sorry.

     As Cody makes his way back to the bar, he notices that more
     LITTLE PEOPLE, dressed as Leprechauns, have arrived. It has
     an unsettling effect on Cody.

     Cody sees Frank come up to the bar and place a bottle of
     Irish Whiskey down in front of Morty. Cody approaches Morty.

                         FRANK
               I wouldn't hang around too long.
               Cops'll probably be back.
                                                        57.



Frank gives Cody a look and leaves them. Morty seems lost in
thought, as he stares at the other side of the bar.

                    CODY
              (excitedly in hushed
               tones)
          Morty, listen. Houdini's Ruins.
          Don't you remember? The drunk at
          the police station said a
          Leprechaun stole his gold tooth. He
          came out of a tree at Houdini's
          Ruins! That's where Bridget is!
          Let's go!

Morty doesn't move. His eyes are riveted on the end of the
bar.

                    CODY (CONT'D)
          Come on, let's get out of here?
              (no response from Morty)
          Morty, let's go?
              (again no response)
          Morty?

                     MORTY
              (without moving)
          He's here.

Cody follow's Morty's gaze to the far end of the bar. Seated
there is the real Leprechaun. He blends in perfectly with the
St. Patrick's day crowd. The Leprechaun sits motionless,
staring back at Cody and Morty, with cold unwavering eyes.
The Leprechaun shows no emotion. Cody slowly leans in close
to Morty.

                    CODY
          Maybe we should go now.

                      MORTY
          Too late.

Cody looks back. The Leprechaun is seated on the other side
of Morty.

                    LEPRECHAUN
              (cold and matter of fact)
          Have I mentioned that I want me
          gold?

Cody moves in. Morty holds him back.
                                                           58.



                    CODY
              (fearless)
          Not until we get Bridget.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Bridget? Don't you know she's a
          married woman?

Cody leans in, as if he's going to slug the Leprechaun. Morty
holds him back.

                    MORTY
              (whispering to Cody)
          I got an idea. Let me handle this.
              (to bar patrons)
          Listen up, everybody! Listen up!
          The bar patrons quiet down and look
          at Morty.

                    MORTY
          My little buddy here just got
          married. What do you say we all
          raise our glasses and toast to his
          good health.

Several of the little people, dressed as leprechauns, come
closer.

                    MORTY
              (to Leprechaun)
          Have a drink, on me.

Morty takes the bottle of Irish whiskey, opens it and pours a
large tumbler. The Leprechaun doesn't move.

                    MORTY: (CONT'D)
          Oh, is there a problem? I guess
          that's all part of the Leprechaun
          myth, that they can hold their
          liquor. There's nothing to be
          ashamed about. Whatta you say I get
          you a... green lemonade, heh heh
          heh.

The crowd laughs. The Leprechaun is humiliated. Morty is
about to take the tumbler of whiskey away.

The Leprechaun grabs it first. With his eyes glued on Morty,
he toasts the crowd. He guzzles down the glass, then slams
it, upside down, on the bar. Assorted cheers from the little
people erupt.
                                                        59.



                    LEPRECHAUN
          I can handle me drink.

                    MORTY
          Is that so? Hey Frank, get me a
          bottle of "Red's Special Rye." I
          want to show my friend how a real
          man drinks.

                    FRANK
              (nods, smiling)
          Coming right up.

CLOSE UP BEHIND BAR

Unseen by anyone, Frank fills an empty whiskey bottle with
cola and water.

On the other side of the bar, Cody watches Morty carefully,
keeping his distance from the menacing villain. Morty and the
Leprechaun's stares remain locked.

                    CODY
              (aside, quietly to Morty)
          What are you doing?!

                    MORTY
              (aside)
          Watch and learn.

Frank places a bottle of "Red's Special Rye" down on the bar.
Morty pours himself a full tumbler. He guzzles it and slams
it, upside down, on the bar. Assorted cheers come from the
"taller" contingent of patrons.

The Leprechaun rolls up his sleeve.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Drink what you want, drink what
          you're able, if you're drinking
          with me, you'll be under the table.

Cheers erupt from the little people in the bar. They have a
challenge. The Leprechaun grabs the bottle of his whiskey.

Everyone watches intently, as the Leprechaun puts the bottle
to his lips. The crowd is silent. The African American little
person speaks up.
                                                             60.



                          LITTLE PERSON
                    (to the other little
                     people)
                Let's cheer him on guys, he's one
                of us!
                    (leading the chant)
                One of us! One of us! One of us!

     The Leprechaun drinks it down. Other little people in the
     crowd start to chant along with the African American little
     person.

                          LITTLE PEOPLE IN UNISON
                One of us! One of us!! One of us!!!

     The Leprechaun slams the empty bottle down on the bar. Cheers
     explode from the little people. Morty holds his gaze on the
     evil Leprechaun from hell. Cody takes in the nightmarish
     atmosphere as it reaches a bizarre crescendo.

                                              CUT TO:

     CLOSE UP

     The pub is now silent. A full bottle of whiskey is placed on
     the bar. The Leprechaun's hand reaches out, groggily, and
     grabs it.

68   INT. BRENNEN'S PUB - LATER                                  68

     The Leprechaun empties the bottle for the umpteenth time. His
     eyes are still riveted on Morty and vice versa. But the
     Leprechaun's eyes are bloodshot and he's having a hard time
     keeping them open. He's wasted.

     Around the bar several little people lie, passed out. The
     African American little person looks at his watch.

                          LITTLE PERSON
                You're my hero, homey. I'm five
                thousand.

     He leaves. Only Cody, Morty, Frank and the Leprechaun are
     awake at the bar.

                          CODY
                    (aside)
                When do we go get Bridget?

                          MORTY
                    (aside)
                Relax, she's safe, while he's here.
                                                           61.



                    LEPRECHAUN
              (slurring his speech)
          Pour all you want, pour what you
          can, he won't beat me...cause I'm a
          Leprech. ..can.

The Leprechaun lets out a burp, then laughs at his lame
attempt at a rhyme. Morty keeps his eyes glued on the
Leprechaun. The Leprechaun's eyelids begin to fall and his
head begins to drop. Morty seizes the moment. In a flash, he
grabs the Leprechaun by the shoulders and holds him, tightly.

                    MORTY
              (through gritted, smiling
               teeth)
          You thought you were fast, you
          thought you were sporty; you
          thought you were clever. but not as
          clever as Morty!

The Leprechaun looks up, confused and angry.

                    CODY
          You got him! Now let's go get
          Bridget!

CLOSE ON LEPRECHAUN

He's staring ahead, concentrating on something intently.

WIDE AT THE BAR

An ashtray DRUNKENLY FLOATS IN MID AIR toward Morty. It zig-
zags in the air, then lamely falls on the ground. Morty
watches this and nods his head, sadly.

                    MORTY
          Didn't anyone ever tell you not to
          drink and levitate? Face it, my
          little friend, you're going to have
          to do what we ask you.

Suddenly MUSIC BLARES FROM THE JUKEBOX. Cody and Morty glance
over to the jukebox. The lights flash. With Morty's head
turned toward the jukebox, the Leprechaun grabs the whiskey
bottle and SMASHES Morty on the back of the head with it.
Morty grabs his head in pain. Cody instinctively moves into
Morty with concern.

                    MORTY
          I'll be fine! Get the son-of-a-
          bitch!
                                                               62.



     They look toward the front door. It swings closed. Cody runs
     toward it and looks down the street.

                         CODY
               No sign of him!

                         MORTY
               Sorry to let you down, kid. I had
               the chance, I blew it.

     An idea strikes Cody as he notices something made of iron in
     the bar.

                         CODY
               Look, wrought iron's the one thing
               that can hurt him, right?

     He grabs a fist full of beef jerky sticks from the bar.

                         CODY (CONT'D)
               I've got a plan.

                                              CUT TO:

69   INT. LAIR - NIGHT                                           69

     CLOSE ON a large collection of stones. PLINK! Another stone
     is added to the pile.

     WIDER - Bridget has amassed about a hundred small stones on
     top of the burlap sheet.

                         BRIDGET
               One way or another, I'm going to
               find a way out of this hell hole.

     She gathers up the corners of the sheet, slings it over her
     shoulder, looks at the various tunnel passages leading out *
     of the lair, and decisively picks one. She seems determined
     that this is going to work. Step by step, she heads toward
     the tunnel and reaches into the collection of stones, leaving
     a trail behind her, each stone about a foot apart. She
     reaches the tunnel opening and looks behind her to check up
     on her trail.

     BRIDGET'S POV of her trail

     One by one, the stones DISAPPEAR behind her (they "pop out"
     in the order they were laid down).

     ON BRIDGET - She lets out a growl of frustration, throws the
     stones down, and heads back into the lair.
                                                              63.



      She enters the lair, looking for a new idea, when her foot
      catches on something in the dirt below.

      ON THE DIRT - a worn, leathered, blunt corner of some kind of
      box or package sticks about an inch out of the dirt.

      Bridget bends down and begins to dig with her hands.

                                               CUT TO:

69A   INT. LAIR - LATER                                        69A

      CLOSE ON BRIDGET - She has some dirt in her face and hair,
      but she still manages to look beautiful.

      ON THE HOLE - it's now about two feet deep. A large box is
      half dug into the earth.

      Bridget grabs hard, and yanks it out.

      It's an ancient case of some kind, about two and a half, feet
      long, and a foot deep. An old, green copper lock keeps it
      closed. Bridget looks at this strange thing. She takes one of
      the larger stones and starts pounding on the lock.

      BANG! BANG! With each pound on the lock, she speaks one of
      the following words:

                          BRIDGET
                Kiss this, you slimy, creep!

      SNAP! She breaks the lock and opens the case.

      ON CASE - A little velvet shelf makes this thing look
      something like the case of your grandmother kept her finest
      silverware set in. Instead of forks and knives,however,
      Bridget finds two little pipes, a gold-rimmed shot glass,
      dusty Guinness bottles, and a collection of different
      miniature Irish whiskey bottles. Bridget lifts up this shelf
      and finds, underneath, several strange little instruments:
      cobbler.'stools. Her eye immediately goes to the AWL - a
      nasty looking thing, something like a screwdriver, but with a
      painfully sharp point. She picks up the awl. She tries to
      bend it, testing its sturdiness.This thing is rock hard. She
      then touches the point with her finger. It's so sharp, it
      pricks her skin (we need not see any blood). She puts her
      finger in her mouth for a second, and says:
                                                             64.



                         BRIDGET
                   (grim determination)
               Yeah...I've got a little wedding
               present for you when you get home.

                                                CUT TO:

70   INT. CAFE - NIGHT                                         70

     An oversized cup of Cafe Latte is filled and placed at the
     counter, next to ten other finished ones. This is a Hollywood
     coffee house. It's empty, except for the Melrose hip WAITER,
     who stands before his last customer, the Leprechaun. The
     waiter has a "too cool for his own good" attitude. Our
     villain downs his eleventh cup, trying to sober up.

                         WAITER
               Okay, pal, St. Patrick's Day's
               over. Time to go home.

     The Leprechaun gives the waiter a sinister look.

                         WAITER (CONT'D)
                   (with attitude)
               Just kidding, just kidding. I have
               to close, okay?

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Aye.

                          WAITER
               Very funny. A method actor.
                   (beat)
               What's your next gig? One of
               Santa's elves or one of the seven
               dwarfs?

     The waiter laughs out loud at his own joke.

                         LEPRECHAUN
                   (seething)
               I'm not an elf or a dwarf. I'm a
               leprechaun.

                         WAITER
                   (annoyed)
               Look, I don't care if you're the
               tooth fairy. Just pay up, so I can
               get out of here.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               So, it's me gold you be wanting?
                                                          65.



                    WAITER
          Gold Card, Visa, Mastercard. I
          prefer cash, but maybe you're a
          little short.

The waiter cracks up at his own joke. The Leprechaun is
getting angry. The waiter continues to laugh.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          One should never try to take a
          Leprechaun's gold.

CLOSE ON THE WAITER - he's at the espresso machine, a huge
industrial model, gathering dirty cups. He puts down the cups
and leans on the counter.

                    WAITER
          You kill me.

The Leprechaun appears in front of him.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Now there's an idea.

CHOK! CHOK! The Leprechaun jams two large forks into each of
the waiter's hands. The waiter wails in anguish.

Two large steam spigots of the oversized, copper, antique,
cappuccino machine twist and point inches away from the
waiter's face. The waiter looks back at the Leprechaun in
disbelief and fear.

                    WAITER
          No! Please!

The Leprechaun, uncaring, holds out his pipe. It ignites by
itself. The Leprechaun takes a drag off of his pipe. He's
loving this.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Hi ho, hi ho.

The waiter tries to free his hands, but they're pinned. The
cappuccino machine starts to rattle and vibrate. It's
building up steam.

                    WAITER
          No!!!! No!!!!!

EXTREME CLOSE UP

The needle in the gauge on the side of the machine begins to
inch its way into the red.
                                                               66.



     The Leprechaun laughs, insidiously.

     Hissing, the machine vibrates turbulently. The waiter screams
     in fear.

     EXTREME CLOSE UP

     The needle in the gauge goes into the red. The glass, over
     the gauge, cracks.

     The spigot spews scalding steam into the waiter's face. The
     waiter screams louder than before. The force of the steam
     blows the waiter back, but his hands are still pinned to the
     counter. The skin on the waiter's face begins to sear from
     the bone.

     The Leprechaun exhales a plume of smoke, as he watches.

     LOW ANGLE SHOT

     The powerful hiss of the steam fizzles out. The waiter falls
     into frame. His "steam cleaned" skull stares out at camera.
     The Leprechaun takes the last sip from his caffe latte.

     LEPRECHAUN: Aye. There's nothing like a little pick me up.

     The Leprechaun chuckles to himself, enjoying his private,
     morbid sense of humor. He leaves.

71   EXT. GRAND PRIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT                          71

     CLOSE ON A FISTFUL OF SLIM JIMS

     WIDER - Cody and Morty are at the gate of the lot. Cody is
     holding the Slim Jims out in front of him.

                         CODY
               Come on, Andretti. We're friends,
               remember? Look, I brought you a
               little late-night snack.

     Suddenly, Andretti, the guard dog comes around a corner,
     snarling viciously. He sniffs the Slim Jims. He takes them in
     his mouth and wanders away from Cody. Morty takes out a
     robber's pick and starts to work on the lock.

                         MORTY
               Nice work. Now, you're sure this
               safe is big enough?
                                                             67.



                         CODY
               Yeah, it's huge. Big old wrought
               iron thing. And if it's a tight
               fit, I'm not shedding any tears.

     Morty gets the door open.

                         MORTY
               Me neither. Come on.

     They enter the compound. They pass Andretti, who's happily
     occupied with his snack.

72   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER                                72

     Cody and Morty break in, using the robber's pick. They enter
     and head for the safe.

                         MORTY
               There she is!

     Morty kisses the safe.

     EXTREME CLOSE UP

     In the corner, the light of a motion detector box is flashing
     red. They've tripped a silent alarm. Cody looks around and
     finds a shelf of racing trophies. He checks under several of
     them and finds the safe's combination. He crosses to the safe
     and rolls the dial.

                         MORTY
               I've taught you well, kid.

                         CODY
               Yeah. I'll send you a postcard from
               San Quentin.

     Cody opens the safe.

                         CODY
               Give me a hand with this.

     Cody and Morty place the contents of the safe into a file
     cabinet drawer. Morty attempts to put a wad of cash, from the
     safe, into his pocket.

                         COD (CONT'D)
                   (sternly)
               Put it back.
                                                             68.



     Morty shrugs and puts the money into the file cabinet. The
     safe, which has wheels, is rolled easily towards the door by
     Cody and Morty.

                         MORTY
               We'll get a double hernia if we try
               and lift this thing in the hearse.
               See if you can find something to
               make a ramp. I'll go get the car.

     Morty leaves. Cody stays behind.

73   EXT. PARKING LOT - FOLLOWING                                 73

     Morty comes outside and goes to the hearse. As he opens the
     door to get in, he's thrown up against the car.

                         WIGGINS (O.S.)
               Security! Keep your hands where I
               can see them.

                         MORTY
               Ow! You're breakin' my arm!

     Morty realizes that it's WIGGINS, a security cop. He forces
     Morty to lean over the hood of the hearse and handcuffs one
     of Morty's hands.

                         WIGGINS (CONT'D)
               You tripped the silent alarm,
               buddy. I'm taking you down.

                         MORTY
               Taking me down where?! You're a
               friggin' security cop!

                         WIGGINS
               That's security officer, pal. You
               the only perp here?

                         MORTY
               Perp? What are you talking about?

     The security cop handcuffs Morty to the door of the hearse.

                         WIGGINS (CONT'D)
               Never mind, tough guy. Don't go
               anywhere.

     The cop, with his weapon drawn, goes towards the compound.
                                                             69.



74   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME                            74

     Cody finds some two by fours propped up in a storage closet,
     next to a shelf of painting supplies. He picks one of them up
     and feels its sturdiness.

75   EXT. GRAND PRIX COMPOUND - SAME TIME                         75

     With a flashlight and revolver at the ready, Wiggins
     approaches the door to the office. He readies himself and
     yanks the door open, shining the light inside.

76   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                            76

     The light shines on the open safe. It shines around the room.
     Cody is not there. The cop flicks on the office lights. He
     searches the room.

     With weapon drawn, he comes around the edge of the large
     desk. In one quick move, he crouches and points his weapon
     under the desk. Cody is not there.

     The cop stands, and notices the storage closet. The door is
     closed. He positions himself and swings the door open.
     Pointing his revolver, he looks inside. No one there. Wiggins
     leaves through the front door.

     Above the desk, a ceiling tile is slightly askew. Cody peeks
     down from his hiding place.

77   INT. SPACE ABOVE SUSPENDED CEILING - FOLLOWING               77

     Cody takes a deep breath. He's eluded the COP. Cody shifts
     quietly. Suddenly, from the corner of the small space... the
     Leprechaun comes out of the shadows.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Watch your head.

     The Leprechaun is able to stand upright in the small space,
     Cody can only crawl. The Leprechaun walks towards him.

                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               You may think this line is getting
               olde, but believe me, son, I want
               me gold.

     Cody scrambles to get away. The Leprechaun steps from support
     beam to support beam, avoiding the soft, styrofoam tiles.

     As Cody looks back, he accidentally puts his hand in the
     middle of a styrofoam tile and falls through to the office
     below.
                                                             70.



78   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                            78

     Cody lands on the floor, amidst styrofoam tiles. He looks up
     and sees the Leprechaun peer out over the opening in the
     ceiling. The Leprechaun growls at Cody.

     Cody grabs a nearby lamp. Its stem is a long, mean-looking
     wrought iron pole, about two feet long. He grabs it and
     throws it at the Leprechaun. The Leprechaun ducks out of the
     way before impact. Cody runs off. The Leprechaun peers out
     from the hole in the ceiling. Cody is gone.

79   EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER                                     79

     Wiggins walks over to Morty, still handcuffed to the hearse.

                         MORTY
               Look, pal. This has been a big
               misunderstanding. If you uncuff me,
               I can reach my wallet, if you know
               what I mean.

                         WIGGINS
               You trying to bribe me, scumbag? I
               take my job seriously.

     Wiggins releases the handcuff from the door.

                         WIGGINS (CONT'D)
               Now don't try anything. I've had
               sixty hours of combat training.

     Suddenly, a.noise is heard from the manager's office. Wiggins
     turns and Morty swings his arms around, smashing Wiggins in
     the chin. Wiggins is down for the count. Morty bends down to
     get the cop's gun.

                         MORTY
               Should of had sixty-five.

     Before Morty can grab the gun, WHACK! The shelaleigh comes
     out of nowhere, cracking Morty in the back. Morty falls to
     his knees in agony. The Leprechaun is face to face with
     Morty.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               It's me olde friend, the drinking
               champ.

     Another painful WHACK! from the shelaleigh.
                                                             71.



                         LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
               You didn't happen to see the young
               lad now, did you?

                         MORTY
               No, I came here alone!

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Wrong answer!

     WHACK!

     Out of nowhere, Andretti, the guard dog, arrives, baring his
     teeth and growling at the Leprechaun. He inches in on the
     villain, who turns toward the dog.

     Andretti stops barking. He retracts and does an about face,
     whimpering. The dog runs off. The Leprechaun turns back
     towards Morty and notices that he's run back into the
     compound.

81   EXT. GRAND PRIX COMPOUND - FOLLOWING                      81

     Morty runs for his life.

                         MORTY
               Cody! Cody!!

     Suddenly Morty slips and lands up against the fence,
     separating the compound from the track. Morty turns around
     and sees the Leprechaun towering over him. The Leprechaun
     brings down the shelaleigh on Morty's midsection. . THWACK!!

     The Leprechaun raises his shelaleigh. The tip of it
     transforms to a stiletto-sharp point. The Leprechaun presses
     the point into Morty's neck.

                         LEPRECHAUN
               Where's the boy?

                         MORTY
               I don't know.

     A voice is heard from behind.

                         CODY (0 .S.)
               I'm here, short stuff... Come and
               get it.
                                                           72.



The Leprechaun spins around and sees Cody, within the
manager's office. Cody stands at the door to the office and
can be seen through the upper window in it.

In his hand, he holds the Leprechaun's gold coin. It gleams
in the moonlight.

The Leprechaun is momentarily transfixed on its shininess.
Like a magician the Leprechaun puts the shelaleigh up his
little sleeve, where it disappears.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Ah, me gold.

The Leprechaun goes to the manager's office. Cody stays
behind the door.

                    CODY
          The offer still stands. The coin
          for Bridget.

                    MORTY
          Don't give it to him!

                    LEPRECHAUN
          I'll keep what I have. And I'll let
          the two of you live. That's me
          offer.

                     CODY
          No deal.

                    MORTY
          That's telling him, kid.

The Leprechaun lowers his gaze from the window, in the door,
to the door's bottom half. There, he spots Andretti's dog
door. Smiling, mischievously, the Leprechaun looks up at
Cody.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          So be it. I'll come get it meself.

The Leprechaun dives through the dog door and disappears
inside. Suddenly, the front door swings open.

We realize that Cody has pushed the open, wrought iron safe
in front of the dog door. The Leprechaun has climbed into it.
Cody slams the safe door shut and spins the combination lock.
From within the wrought iron safe, the Leprechaun screams in
pain.
                                                              73.

      The Leprechaun is jostled in the safe, touching the wrought
      iron sides with his bare hands. Every time his flesh connects
      with the iron, he sizzles and screams in pain.

      The safe starts MOVING and the Leprechaun is being tortured.

89    INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                        89

      Cody has pushed the safe inside. Morty, still wearing the
      cuffs on one hand, has joined Cody in the office. He kneels
      at a desk and, using his robber's pick, gets out of the
      cuffs.

                          MORTY
                Nice going, Cody! I'm real proud of
                you.

                I thought hangovers were bad. Just
                hope nothing's broken.

      Morty leans down to the safe and shakes it.

                Absolutely.

      Morty takes a beat and looks around.

                         CODY
               Three wishes!? Morty, NO! You're
               screwing it all up!

                         MORTY
               Don't worry! We'll all get what we
               want!

                         LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               Open this door!!

     Morty is relishing every second of this.

                         MORTY
               First, my wishes! Now... I could
               ask for a million dollars. Even a
               billion dollars. But no. I think
               I'd like your crummy pot of gold!

     Cody screams from inside the storage closet.
                                                             76.



                         CODY
                   (inside closet)
               Morty, stop it!

     Morty is ignoring Cody. He's caught up in the moment.

                          MORTY
               Do you hear me in there? I want
               your gold!

94   INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS                                  94

                         CODY
               Morty!! Don't do it! Let me out!

95   INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                  95

                         LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               Oh, it's a greedy man that I'm
               dealing with.

     From the closet, Cody is going ballistic. He keeps pounding.

                           CODY
               Don't!!

     Morty ignores Cody's pleas.

                         LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               Are you sure you want it?

                         MORTY
                   (stern1y)
               My first wish is for the gold!

                           LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               So be it.

     Morty smiles, waiting for his prize.

                         MORTY
               Well, where is it?

                         LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
                   (mischievously)
               Oh, it's coming.

     Suddenly, Morty feels a sharp pain in his stomach. He leans
     up against a desk, holding his midsection. His belly starts
     to grow. The pot of gold has been put inside of him. Morty
     realizes what's going on. He begins to scream in pain.
                                                               77.



                         MORTY
               Get it out of me! Get it out!

96   INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS                                    96

     Cody watches on in horror, as Morty falls to the floor.

                         CODY
               Oh, God!! Morty! ! No!!

97   INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                    97

     Morty writhes on the floor, in front of the safe.

                         MORTY
               Get it out!!

                          LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               I can do it, but you have to let me
               out of this safe first.
                   (beat)
               Do you wish me out of the safe?

                          MORTY
               Yes, goddamn it!! Yes! I wish you
               out of the safe.
                   (beat)
               Where the hell are you?

                         LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
               You'll have to open the door, it's
               wrought iron. Remember? Didn't you
               read the book?

     In pain, Morty reaches up and starts to turn the combination.

98   INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS                                    98

     Cody punches at the glass, repeatedly, it's too thick.

                         CODY
               Stop it!! Morty!

     Cody looks around the closet for something to break the
     glass.

99   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                           99

     Screaming in pain, Morty dials in the numbers. When finished,
     he opens up the safe door, and falls back, exhausted. The
     Leprechaun steps out. He dusts himself off and beams with
     pride.
                                                              78.



                          LEPRECHAUN
                Your second wish has been granted.

                          MORTY
                    (writhing in a panic)
                Get it out of me!

                          LEPRECHAUN
                You see, you shouldn't be so
                greedy.

                          MORTY
                Come on!! Get it out, I said!

                          LEPRECHAUN
                So, is that your wish?

                          MORTY
                Yes, yes, yes. Get it out!! I wish
                you to get it out of me!

                             LEPRECHAUN
                Very well.

      The Leprechaun stands above Morty, holding up his sharp
      fingernails. Morty's eyes widen in horror as the Leprechaun
      rips open his belly (O.S.) with his bare hands. Morty screams
      louder than before.

100   INT. STORAGE CLOSET - SAME TIME                          100

      Cody yells at the window as he watches. He starts pulling
      cans of paint from a shelf, to break the glass. He notices
      that the shelf conceals a rear window.

101   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME                        101

      The Leprechaun holds his pot o' gold, proudly.

                          MORTY
                    (dying words)
                Help me.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                Love to, friend. But you're all out
                of wishes.

      Morty dies.

      The Leprechaun laughs. With a wave of his hand, his crock
      disappears. A crash from the storage closet is heard. The
      Leprechaun looks to the door and it swings open magically.
                                                              79.


      The closet is empty. The window, leading outside, is smashed
      open. Cody is gone. The Leprechaun growls and DISAPPEARS.

102   EXT. GRAND PRIX COMPOUND - FOLLOWING                     102

      Cody rushes around the building to the manager's office. He
      pulls the door open, quickly, and runs inside.

103   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE. SAME TIME                         103

      Cody enters the office. He sees Morty, lying on the floor,
      dead. Cody rushes to the dead man's side. The Leprechaun is
      nowhere to be seen.

                          CODY
                Morty! Come on, man! Why'd you do
                it? No. Don't die. Morty!! NOOO!

      Cody realizes that he's too late. He looks up slowly. His
      blood is boiling. He carefully looks around the office and
      finds the wrought iron lamp he had earlier thrown at the
      Leprechaun. The base and bulb part have broken off, leaving a
      razor-sharp, deadly-looking jagged edge. He weighs it in his
      hands.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
                All right, you little bastard, come
                and get me!

      All of a sudden, CLICK. The barrel of a forty-five is pressed
      up against his temple. It's Wiggins, the security cop,
      holding the gun.

                          WIGGINS
                Drop the weapon, you psycho.

                          CODY
                I...

                          WIGGINS
                Do it! Now!

      Cody drops the iron base. Wiggins motions to Morty.

                          WIGGINS (CONT'D)
                How many more people have you
                killed tonight?

                          CODY
                What are you talking about?

                          WIGGINS
                I know who you are! I saw you on
                the news.
                          (MORE)
                                                              80.
                          WIGGINS (CONT'D)
                The whole town's looking for you. .
                Put your hands behind your head,
                stand up, and move. Slowly.

      Cody obeys the order. He's led outside.

104   EXT. GRAND PRIX COMPOUND - FOLLOWING                        104

      The door to the office slams open. Cody comes out first, with
      his hands behind his head. Wiggins follows, with his weapon
      aimed at Cody. They walk towards the parking lot.

                          WIGGINS
                Don't try anything funny. I'm
                taking you in.

      A woman crying is heard from the other side of the track.

                          LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
                    (in a woman's voice)
                Help! Help me, please!!

      Wiggins, panicked, looks out over the track. He doesn't see
      anyone.

                          CODY
                It's a trick! Don't...

                          WIGGINS
                Shut up! What kind of spree you on,
                sicko?!

                          CODY
                No! It's the Lep...

      The security cop clicks back the hammer on his .45.

                          WIGGINS
                I'm not afraid to use this! Now
                take me to her!

                          LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
                (in woman's voice
                Please. Hurry. That boy's hurt me.

                          WIGGINS
                We're coming, ma'am!

      Wiggins leads Cody towards the track.

105   EXT. TRACK - FOLLOWING                                      105

      Cody, the gun to his head; is led out to the middle of the
      track.
                                                         81.



                     CODY
           Listen to me! Call for backup!

                       WIGGINS
           Shut up!

Suddenly, the headlights of a go cart snap on. The cop
squints. A loud cackle is heard.

                     WIGGINS (CONT'D)
           What is this, a trick?

At the far side of the track, behind the wheel of the go
cart, sits the Leprechaun. It is a Mad Max-like go cart from
hell.

                     LEPRECHAUN
           You'll not be taking the boy
           anywhere. I'll have me gold.

CLOSE UP

On the go cart's tires spinning violently. The cart is thrown
into gear and screeches out of frame.

Wiggins and Cody are caught in the high beams of the go cart
from hell. Wiggins positions himself on one knee for a shot.
Cody runs off.

The go cart rushes toward Wiggins. He fires repeatedly at the
go cart. Six shots and his gun is empty. Wiggins is frozen,
like a deer caught in the headlights.

                     LEPRECHAUN
               (laughing)
           You missed me!

                       WIGGINS
           No!!!!!

Wiggins starts to run.

SHORT CHASE SEQUENCE

As the Leprechaun chuckles with glee, the go cart mows down
Wiggins.

                       CODY
           NO!

                     LEPRECHAUN
               (to Cody)
           I want me coin. Give it to me...
                                                          82.



Cody sees the go cart flying closer to him.

LONGER CHASE

Cody runs. The go cart gains. It's right on Cody's tail. Cody
dives to the side, out of harm's way.

The go cart drives past and screeches to a stop. It does a
one-eighty and points back towards our hero.

The Leprechaun revs the engine. Cody rises and books. He zigs
and zags, trying to throw the Leprechaun off, but it's no
use. Cody rushes by a small plywood figure of a clown,
extending his hand, about four feet off of the ground. The
short wooden clown speaks out of a comic book style dialogue
balloon.

The balloon reads: IF YOU'RE NOT THIS TALL, YOU CAN'T DRIVE!

Suddenly, CRASH! The Leprechaun plows through the wooden
clown with his go cart, obliterating it. He continues after
Cody. Cody runs for dear life. The Leprechaun is behind him.
Suddenly, Cody trips. His foot catches on a tire, lying on
the ground. Cody collapses. He can only hold up his hands and
wait for the impact. The go cart stops, ten feet from Cody...

The engine roars loudly.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Give me the coin, boy, and I'll let
          you live.

                    CODY
              (screaming)
          I'm not giving you anything 'til I
          get Bridget. You'll have to kill
          me, if you want your stinking piece
          of gold.

                      LEPRECHAUN
          So be it.

The Leprechaun hits the gas and heads for Cody. Cody tries to
get to his feet, but his foot is stuck. The impact is
imminent. Cody lets out a kamikaze yell!

The go cart hits Cody, but... passes riqht throuqh him.

The Leprechaun spins and screeches to a stop, facing Cody.
Cody frees his leg and stands, unscathed. He turns towards
the Leprechaun, in disbelief. The Leprechaun looks very
angry.
                                                                  83.



                           CODY
                 I'm not dead.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 You will be if you don't give me
                 the coin!

       The Leprechaun doesn't move. Cody takes the coin out of his
       pocket and looks at it, comprehending its power.

                           CODY
                 You can't do it, can you?

       Cody holds up the coin.

                           CODY (CONT'D)
                 As long as I have this!

       The Leprechaun growls at Cody.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 You have to give it to me!!

                            CODY
                     (cool)
                 You want it, come get it.

       Cody stands, defiantly, holding the coin. The Leprechaun
       throws the go cart into gear. It speeds towards Cody. Its
       headlights shine. Cody stands his ground. The go cart screams
       to a halt, inches from him.

       The driver's seat is empty. The Leprechaun is gone. Cody
       calls out into the night sky.

                            CODY (CONT'D)
                 I'm going to save Bridget, and then
                 I'm gonna get you! You can't hide
                 from me!
                     (beat)
                 I know where you live!

                                                CUT TO:

106    OMITTED                                                     106

106A   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT                              106A

       CLOSE ON the jagged-edged wrought iron lamp base. Cody's
       hands reach in and grab it.
                                                                 84.



106B   EXT. GRAND PRIX - NIGHT                                   106B

       Cody slams the door to the hearse shut and drives away.

       CAMERA PANS

       to the Leprechaun lurking in the shadows.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 I'll be waiting. The Leprechaun's
                 home has many surprises.

       The Leprechaun begins to turn around... CAMERA MOVES IN TO A

108    INT. INNER LAIR - NIGHT                                    108

       CLOSE ON the Leprechaun's back (matching from previous shot) -
       - he continues to turn around. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to
       reveal he is in the lair. He looks around, searching for
       Bridget.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 Sweeteee? Still playing games? Come
                 out, we may be having a house guest
                 soon.

       Bridget herself appears from one of the tunnels. She's
       cleaned up and looks ravishing.

                           BRIDGET
                 Where were you? I was so lonely.
                 How could you leave a bride on her
                 wedding night?

       She seductively walks toward the bed and sits on it.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 Later, my dear. I have to prepare
                 for our visitor.

                           BRIDGET
                 What visitor could be more
                 important than me? After all, I
                 thought you waited a thousand
                 years.
                                                        85.



                    LEPRECHAUN
          That I have...

The Leprechaun joins Bridget on the bed. She begins to touch
the back of his head. He relaxes. He cannot see her face,
which shows the agony she is in.

                    LEPRECHAUN (CONT'D)
          It's been a long millennium for the
          Leprechaun, and he's had no one to
          care for his needs.

                    BRIDGET
          Well, that's why I'm here, to give
          what you deserve.

The CAMERA PANS DOWN to under the bed, where Bridget has
hidden the awl. She carefully reaches down, grabs it, and
JAMS IT INTO THE LEPRECHAUN'S BACK!

BUT -- it doesn't penetrate. Instead it bends in two like a
coat hanger! The Leprechaun spins and grabs the awl.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Me favorite awl! Me Da gave that to
          me, and you've gone and broke it!
                                                              86.



112   INT. LEPRECHAUN'S LAIR - FOLLOWING                          112

      Cody makes his way in, carefully. The flare throws a hellish
      red glow on the walls. The lair is silent and dark. The
      sounds from outside are gone. Cody looks every which way.

                          CODY
                    (calling)
                Bridget!!

113   INT. LAIR TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                               113

      WITH CODY -- Cody slowly moves on. He scratches his head.

      CLOSE ON CODY'S SCALP

      A small, single cockroach has landed on his head.

      WIDER

      Cody continues scratching his head. He looks at his hand, and
      he sees that his hand is crawling with cockroaches. He shakes
      them off, in disgust.

      He crunches the cockroaches under his feet. Cody gets the
      last ones off of him. Angrily, he stomps on them, one final
      time.

                          CODY
                    (sarcastic)
                Yeah, this is gonna be real easy.

      Cody fights his way through the clinging cobwebs, from the
      passageway into another.

114   INT. TUNNEL - FOLLOWING                                     114

      Cody enters the tunnel. He walks a few yards and notices that
      the tunnel ends at an abrupt stop. He punches the wall,
      thwarted. Cody turns. The Leprechaun stands in front of him.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                A little lost, are you?

      Cody charges the Leprechaun. The imp disappears from sight.
      Cody looks around. He's gone.

                                               CUT TO:

115   INT. INNER LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                115

      Bridget, still shackled to the bed, reaches in desperation
      toward the bent awl on the floor. It's a stretch.
                                                           87.


She clenches her teeth and tries, but the more she stretches,
the tighter the bond around her neck chokes her.

Cody retraces his steps to the head of the passageway. He
turns a corner. The SKELETON, partially embedded, in the wall
stares out. Cody jumps back.

                    CODY
          Man!!!

Cody exhales, calming himself.

                    CODY (CONT'D)
              (to skeleton)
          What a cliche.

All of a sudden, the skeleton grabs for Cody's pocket, in an
attempt to take the coin. Cody backs off, but the skeleton
keeps coming. The skeleton rips himself free from the dirt
wall and advances on our hero.

The skeleton grabs hold of the wrought iron bar in Cody's
hand and pulls. Cody drops the flashlight and clutches the
bar with both hands.

Cody falls back, with the skeleton on top of him. The
skeleton reaches again for Cody's pocket with one hand and
pushes the point of the bar towards Cody's neck with the
other. Cody moves, the bar digs into the ground.

The Leprechaun stands at the entrance to another tunnel,
watching the fight.

                    LEPRECHAUN
          Get him, slave! Get the coin!

The skeleton stabs at Cody's head with the bar, repeatedly.
Cody rolls one way, then the other. Escaping the point of the
bar.

Cody gets up, still gripping the end of the bar. The skeleton
holds the other end. Cody swings the skeleton around,
smashing him into the wall of the lair.

He turns quickly and points the bar in the direction of the
Leprechaun. He's not there. Cody hears the Leprechaun's
footsteps. Cody picks up the flashlight and pursues the
running steps.

                    CODY
          You better run, you hear me? 'Cause
          you're next!

                                          CUT TO:

116A   INT. INNER LAIR - CONTINUOUS                               116A

       Bridget is sweating, still reaching for the awl. An idea
       comes to her -- she tries another approach. She uses her
       feet! She stretches her legs and, yes, they reach the awl.

116B   INT. TUNNEL - FOLLOWING                                    116B

       Cody runs down the tunnel and finds that, it too, ends.

                           LEPRECHAUN (O.S.)
                 Wrong again.

       The Leprechaun laughs in the distance. Cody retraces his
       steps out and goes down a side passage.

116C   INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY - FOLLOWING                        116C

       Cody enters a dark passageway. Only his flashlight throws
       light on the area.

       CODY: Bridget!! (under his breath, frustrated) Where are you?

       Suddenly, Cody slips and disappears into a hole in the
       ground.

117    INT. UNDERGROUND VINEY PIT - FOLLOWING                      117

       Cody finds himself entwined in a pit of thorny vines. He
       drops the flashlight to the floor far below. Cody turns this
       way and that, the thorns digging deep into his skin. The
       light, from the fallen flashlight, flickers. Cody screams in
       pain. Suddenly, the Leprechaun appears in the pit with Cody.
       His face and hands taunt and grab at our hero.

                           LEPRECHAUN
                 Give me the coin, I'll let you go.

       Cody screams, as he fights back the tangle of thorns. The
       light flashes. Just when Cody is about to give up hope, the
       light goes out...

118    INT. TUNNEL - FOLLOWING                                     118

       Cody jabs at the air, as if fighting off the Leprechaun and
       the thorns. He realizes that he's free and that he doesn't
       have a scratch on him. It was all a sick, horrifying game.

       When the green glow shines again, Cody finds himself at the
       entrance to the inner lair. Gripping, his wrought iron bar,
       he enters.
                                                                 89.



119   INT. INNER LAIR - FOLLOWING                                 119

      Inside, he sees Bridget. She is still shackled to a bedpost.
      Her hands are now behind her head. Cody moves towards her.

                          BRIDGET
                Cody!

                          CODY
                Bridget! Are you all right?! What
                has he done to you?!

      BANG! The Leprechaun bursts out of a paper rock directly in
      front of Cody (much like a girl popping out of a cake).

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Surprise! Don't take another step.

      Their eyes are transfixed on each other.

                          BRIDGET
                Cody, run. Get out of here.

                          CODY
                I'm not leaving without you!

                          BRIDGET
                Go!

      ANGLE BEHIND BRIDGET'S BACK -and we see her frantically
      working the point of the awl into the rear joint of the neck
      shackle. She's managed to pry it open a little bit. Just a
      little more pressure, and it's ready to snap.

      BACK TO SCENE

                          LEPRECHAUN
                What will you do now, Cody? Do you
                think you can beat me? Here, in my
                home!

      The Leprechaun laughs, mischievously. Cody grips the bar
      tightly. The moment is tense. Who will strike first?
      Suddenly...

                          BRIDGET
                Take your damn ring back! I don't
                want it anymore!

      Bridget rips off the shackle and -- CLUNK! She flings the
      shackle toward the Leprechaun, with a direct hit on the
      Leprechaun's head. It knocks his hat off, momentarily
      disorienting him.
                                                              90.



                          CODY
                RUN!

      The Leprechaun looks back at Bridget. She's disappeared down
      the passageway. The Leprechaun starts after her. He stops and
      looks back towards Cody, but... Cody is gone.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                A game of hide and seek? How
                lovely.

      The Leprechaun takes off after Bridget.

121   INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME                                  121

      The Leprechaun moves down a tunnel, slowly. He listens for
      Bridget's footsteps.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                You know you won't get out.

122   INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME                      122

      Bridget is running for dear life. She turns a corner. Another
      dead end. She hears the Leprechaun's snickering, turns and
      runs out.

123   INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME                                  123

      The Leprechaun stands quietly, listening for Bridget.

124   INT. PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME                              124

      Bridget runs, in desperation, down another passageway. It
      seems to go on forever. Again, Bridget comes to a dead end.
      Out of nowhere, two arms grab her from behind. She's about to
      scream, when a hand covers her mouth. It's Cody.

                          CODY
                Come on, we've gotta find a way
                out.

                          BRIDGET
                Cody, I've tried!

                          CODY
                We'll do it! Together! Now, come
                on!
                                                               91.



       They look both ways. Suddenly, at shoulder height, from a
       hole in the rock, the Leprechaun sticks his head out and
       cackles. Cody swings the bar at the Leprechaun, who
       disappears into the hole.

       Cody grabs Bridget. They run off, down the tunnel.

       Holding hands, Bridget and Cody run through the tunnel,
       toward the light at the other end. They run through, and are
       back in

127    INT. INNER LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                127

       CLOSE ON our couple as they emerge from the tunnel.

       We PULL BACK to reveal them standing in the lair. They react
       with surprise.

                           CODY
                 We're right back where we started!

       The entrances to four tunnels lay before them -- and they
       just emerged from tunnel #1.

                           BRIDGET
                 There's gotta be a way out of this
                 place!

                           CODY
                 Come on. Let's try this one.

       CLOSE TWO SHOT

       as they run into tunnel #4, and disappear in the darkness. *

       CLOSE ON Tunnel #1 -- Cody and Bridget emerge --

       PULL BACK TO REVEAL them standing in the lair -- THE EXACT
       SAME CAMERA MOVE as when they previously emerged from this
       tunnel.

                           CODY
                 Damn! Let's try this one.

       They run into tunnel #3. And, IN THE SAME SHOT, immediately
       emerge from tunnel #2 again!
                                                              92.


      Without saying a word, Cody grabs Bridget's hand, and they
      run into tunnel #2, only to * come out of #1 again.

                          BRIDGET
                What are we going to do?!

                          CODY
                I've got an idea.

      Cody grabs Bridget, and takes her into tunnel #1.

      Cody emerges from tunne #3, ALONE. He looks around.

                            CODY (CONT'D)
                BRIDGET!

      Cody runs back into the tunnel from where he came. Calling
      her name.

      He comes out at the inner lair. Cody realizes where he is. In
      the center of the inner lair, Bridget stands, with her back
      to the entrance.

                          CODY
                Bridget! Are you okay?!

      Bridget turns around excitedly and jumps with a start. Relief
      comes over her face. She rushes into Cody's arms.

                          BRIDGET
                I saw him, I saw the Leprechaun!

                          CODY
                Where is he?

                          BRIDGET
                Back in the tunnels. I managed to
                get away.
                                                        93.



She throws her arms around him.

                    BRIDGET
          Come on. You're not going to
          believe this, but I think I
          actually found a way out of here!

                    CODY
          Well, let's go!

They start to leave together.

                    BRIDGET
          Oh, do you have the coin?

                       CODY
          Yeah, why?

                    BRIDGET
          Leave the damn thing here. That's
          what he wants.

                    CODY
          But, Bridget, as long as we have
          this coin, he can't hurt us. We're
          dead without this coin!

                    BRIDGET
          Listen to me, Cody. If leaving the
          coin will keep this creep from
          following us, we've got to do it!

                       CODY
          But...

                    BRIDGET
          I know it's scary. But it'll be
          okay.

Cody looks into Bridget's pleading eyes.

                    BRIDGET (CONT'D)
          Give me the coin, and let's get out
          of here. Please.

Cody reaches into his pocket. He pulls out the coin and looks
at it, in the palm of his hand. Cody hesitates.

                    BRIDGET (CONT'D)
          I love you, Cody.

Bridget kisses Cody. As they break, Cody steps back, taken by
the kiss. After a beat, Cody hands the coin to Bridget.
                                                                94.


      Bridget crosses to the flat top rock and sits down. She looks
      back at Cody, holding the gold piece in her hand. She starts
      to laugh... in the Leprechaun's voice.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                    (in the Leprechaun's
                     voice)
                You lose.

      Bridget transforms into the Leprechaun. The Leprechaun laughs
      with maniacal glee. Cody is stunned.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Ha, ha, ha. I fooled you. Now,
                there's nothing to protect you.
                I've got the coin and there's no
                stopping me now. You can't outsmart
                a genius.

                          CODY
                Where's Bridget?!

      Leprechaun waves his hands. Bridget materializes out of thin
      air in front of a tunnel.

                          BRIDGET
                    (crying)
                Don't hurt him. I'll go with you.

      The Leprechaun joins her and paws her.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                Yes you will. But, it's time to
                finish this annoying boy off, once
                and for all.

                             CODY (0.S.)
                Like hell.

      Cody rushes the Leprechaun, with the bar in hand. The
      Leprechaun looks to Cody, waves his hand and sends Cody
      travelling back into the tunnel. Cody crashes (O.S.).

                             BRIDGET
                Cody!!

      Bridget runs down the tunnel.

133   INT. TUNNEL - FOLLOWING                                    133

      Bridget reaches Cody's side. He rolls over onto his back and
      looks down at the wrought iron spear, sticking out of his
      midsection. Cody looks up at her.
                                                              95.



                             CODY
                Bri...

      Cody slumps forward, dead.

                          BRIDGET
                Cody! No!! Cody!!

      The light at the end of the tunnel is obscured. A dark shadow
      falls over Bridget. The Leprechaun stands at the opening into
      the inner lair. Bridget stands and turns towards him,crying.

                             BRIDGET (CONT'D)
                He's dead?

      As if in a trance, Bridget, defeated stands at the entrance
      to the inner lair.

                           BRIDGET (CONT'D)
                    (still sucking in tears)
                It's over?

                          LEPRECHAUN
                    (smiling devilishly)
                Aye. Cry as you may, cry as you
                might. It's going to be one hell of
                a wedding night.

      The Leprechaun steps forward to take Bridget's hand, when...

      Bridget is pushed to the side and Cody comes out of the
      shadows, behind her. He holds his wrought iron spear in front
      of him. With one smooth, forceful thrust, he jabs home the
      weapon, skewering a surprised Leprechaun through the heart.

                          CODY
                In your dreams, buddy.

134   INT. INNER LAIR - FOLLOWING                              134

      The Leprechaun staggers back, in shock, into the inner lair.
      He conjures up his gold coin and looks at it, questioningly.
      He looks back at Cody. The Leprechaun begins to glow and
      vibrate. The wrought iron burns the Leprechaun's insides. He
      writhes and twists in pain, staggering back.

                          LEPRECHAUN
                    (struggling)
                But, you...

                          CODY
                It's real milk chocolate...genius.
                                                              96.



      Cody takes the coin from the Leprechaun, unwraps it and pops
      it into his mouth.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
                Mmm. Magically delicious.

      Cody and Bridget run away as the Leprechaun convulses. The
      Leprechaun is obliterated, in an outstanding special effects
      explosion.

      Cody takes. the real coin out of his pocket and holds it up
      for Bridget to see.

                          CODY (CONT'D)
                I guess he was looking for this.

      The lair begins to shake and rumble all around them. A RAY OF
      SUNLIGHT BURSTS THROUGH ONE OF THE TUNNELS. Cody grabs
      Bridget by the hand and they head down a tunnel.

135   OMITTED                                                     135

136   OMITTED                                                     136

137   EXT. HOUDINI'S RUINS - TREE SITE - DAWN                     137

      Cody emerges from the cracked tree at Houdini's ruins,
      pu11ing Bridget behind him. He yanks Bridget up into his
      arms. They hug tightly. Behind them, the tree collapses into
      the earth below. It disappears into the ground. A dark pit is
      left in its place. Bridget turns to Cody.

                          BRIDGET
                How'd you know it wasn't me you
                gave the coin to before?

                          CODY
                He kisses different from you.

      Bridget grabs Cody and kisses him passionately. She looks
      into his eyes. They kiss again.

                          BRIDGET
                Whose kiss do you like better?

                          CODY
                I'll have to think about it.

      Bridget playfully punches him. Cody takes out the
      Leprechaun's coin, looks at it.
                                                        97.



                    BRIDGET
          You going to keep it?

                    CODY
          Trust me. It's not worth it.

Cody flicks the coin into the dark pit. The crater seals up.
Leaves blow by the empty place where the crater once was.
Bridget embraces Cody, as the morning sun rises above the
Hollywood Hills. It's been a very long night.

                                         FADE OUT
