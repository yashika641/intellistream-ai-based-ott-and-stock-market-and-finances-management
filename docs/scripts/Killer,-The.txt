    FADE IN:

    INT. PARIS OFFICE -- NIGHT
1                                                                 1

    A large, dark, unfinished space.   No one here.

    INT. PARIS OFFICE SPACE, BATHROOM -- NIGHT
2                                                                 2

    No one in the dark, modern, albeit in-progress BATHROOM.

    INT. PARIS OFFICE SPACE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
3                                                                 3

    No one in the under-construction KITCHEN AREA.

    INT. PARIS OFFICE SPACE, COMMON AREA -- NIGHT

    Not a soul amongst the dark CUBICLES, or in the adjoining
    LOUNGE AREA, which hosts SAW HORSES, a BAND SAW, and
    other CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. Light TRAFFIC is HEARD
    along with distant PEDESTRIAN VOICES through an open
    WINDOW at the far end, as the glow of HEADLIGHTS casts
    pale abstract patterns onto the ceiling. As if our eyes
    are adjusting to the dark... we begin to see... this room
    is not so em pty as it seemed. We can make out the FIGURE
    of a MAN seated stark still to one side of the window...

    Meet THE KILLER.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               It's amazing how physically
               exhausting it can be to do
               nothing. If you're unable to
               endure boredom, this work is not
               for you.

    We see The Killer first mostly in silhouette.
    He is seated erect in a straight backed, folding CHAIR,
    close enough to the window to be abl e to peer out.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Paris awakens unlike any other
               city. Slowly. Without the diesel
               grind of Berlin or Damascus. Or
               the incessant hum of Tokyo.

    The Killer leans slightly forward so his unremarkable,
    lately unshaven, 40-something face is cut by the shadow
    of the sill from the bridge of his nose down.

    Lights from below reflect in his eyes.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Popeye the Sailor probably said it
               best... "I am what I am."


                                                      CONTINUED
                                                             2.


    If you're paying strict attention, you might notice he
    blinks only very occasionally, but who would notice that?

    The Killer breathes, exhaling slowly through his nose.
    He looks to his black FITBIT, TAPS from WATCH to HEART
    MONITOR: which reads "45 bpm."

                            THE KILLER (V.O.)
              It's not that I'm exceptional.
              I'm just... apart.

    He remains seated, motionless, watching. A heavy DROP
    CLOTH hangs as make-shi ft window covering, and except for
    it's slight undulating this is a still life.

                            THE KILLER (V.O.)
              I am The Stranger amongst you.

    The Killer has a vantage point on a GRANDIOSE APARTMENT
    BUILDING across a small SQUARE.

                                                       CUT TO:

    DAWN SUNLIGHT is breaking on The Killer, who is where we
    first saw him, looking out the brightening window.

    We see a PICTURE WINDOW framed by the ornate faï¿½ade of
    that GRANDIOSE APARTMENT BUILDING across the SQUARE.
    The window's CURTAINS are CLOSED.

    After a moment, The Killer stands and stretches his arms
    and shoulders. He tilts his head side to side to crack
    his neck, stifling a yawn.

    He's wearing LATEX GLOVES.

                            THE KILLER (V.O.)
              Consider yourself lucky if our
              paths never cross.

    The Killer crosses the large space.
    DROP CLOTHS have been rolled aside to create a clear path
    where he can walk on bare floor. (He wears flat soled,
    SKETCHERS SNEAKERS. )
                                                              3.

     Crossing the KITCHEN SPACE, The Killer goes to a SINK.
     He takes a small, stainless steel DISK from his pocket.
     As he opens it, we see...

     ...it is a COLLAPSIBLE DRINKING CUP.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Except, luck isn't real.

     The gloved Killer runs the sink's FAUCET to fill the 6
     ounce cup. He drinks, then shakes it over the sink a few
     times to rid it of excess water. He collapses the cup,
     pockets it, cros ses back.

                               THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Nor is karma.    Or, sadly, justice.

     The Killer returns to the window, where he sits back at
     his post.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               As much as I would like to pretend
               these concepts exist...

     The Killer bends to reach a medium-sized BACKPACK.

     The PACK has some heft to it, although we don't see
     inside. The Killer UNZIPS it on his lap.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               ...they don't.

     From the PACK, The Killer takes out a small, old-school
     iPOD MINI with wired EAR PODS wrapped neatly around it.
     He zips the PACK shut, slides it back.

     The Killer unfurls the headphones.

                               THE KILLER (V.O.)
               One is born.

     Putting an EAR POD in his right ear, letting the other
     dangle, The Killer thumbs the Mini, adjusts volume and
     slides it into his breast pocket.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Lives their life.

                                                             4.


     The Killer resumes watching.
     He seems neither bored nor particularly interested;
     merely vigilantly sentinel.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               And eventually, one dies.

     The window's CURTAINS are still CLOSED.   No sign of life.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               In the meantime...

     The Killer moves to his window. He's peering down
     through the narrow gap between window and drop-cloth, to
     see without being seen.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               "Do what thou wilt shall be the
               whole of the law." To quote...
               someone; can't remember who.

     He casts his gaze further downward.

     A new day's begun on this somewhat touristy street of
     SHOPS, small CAFES and BARS.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               140 million human beings are born

     The Killer placidly observes.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Worldwide population is

     On an open area of bare floor, the Killer, still gloved,
     does YOGA. He transitions...

               Skepticism is often mistaken for
               cynicism.

     ...to a PLANK POSE. He holds it, breathing evenly,
     alternates lifting his legs behind, maintaining rigid,
     exacting yoga form. He brings one bent knee forward...

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Most people refuse to believe that
               the Great Beyond is no more than a
               cold, infinite void... but I
               accept it.

     ...rises slowly, on one foot, to a BALANCING STICK POSE,
     which he holds a moment before... he transitions, moving
     with some fluidity... to a WARRIOR POSE.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Along with the freedom that comes
               from acknowledging that truth.

     Straightening, The Killer suddenly drops to begin doing
     FINGERTIP PUSH-UPS, slowly...

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               It occurs to me, that "the
               moment," when it's time to act, is
               not when my risk is greatest.

     ...with his eyes closed, and his BREATHING -- deeply IN
     and OUT with each rise and fall of his body -- as much a
     part of the exercise as the push-ups themselves.
     Throughout, he doesn't break a sweat -- this isn't
     strenuous exercise, it's disciplined fine tuning.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               The real problems arise in the
               days, hours and minutes leading up
               to the task, and the min utes,
               hours and days after.
               Eliminating risk comes down to
               preparation, attention to detail,
               redundancies... redundancies...
               and redundancies.

     The Killer comes to the FRONT DOOR. He kneels to open a
     leather TRAVEL BAG on the floor beside a MOTORCYCLE
     HELMET with dark tinted VISOR.

     A few pieces of folded CLOTHING are amongst the ORGANIZED
     CONTENTS, including a BUCKET HAT and SUNGLASSES, both of
     which The Killer takes and puts on. He next removes a
     silenced GLOCK HANDGUN. From a side pocket...

     ...he gets a MONEY CLIP with a CREDIT CARD cl ipped
     amongst EUROS. He unzips another compartment which holds
     a NUMBER of (burner) PHONES. He takes one PHONE.

     The Killer straightens, pockets the phone and money.
     On his way to the door, he secures the Glock in his
     waistband, under his shirt. He peeps out the PEEPHOLE.
     He turns the doorknob, heading out.

     The Killer shuts the door, tests (it's got a KEYCARD
     DEADBOLT above the knob) to make sure it's SECURE.
     He glances at his Fitbit, walking briskly past...

               And avoid being seen. Which is

               The camo I'm wearing is based on a
               German tourist I saw in London, a
               while back.

     The Killer's just another PEDESTRIAN headed for a small
     KIOSK which is over-crowded with parked MOTORCYCLES,
     SCOOTERS, BIKES and the like.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               No one really wants to interact
               with a German tourist.

     The Killer glances around -- as will often be his habit --
     arriving at a shiny new VESPA parked curbside.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               Parisians avoid them like the rest
               of the world avoids street mimes.

     He checks the PADLOCK on a KRYPTONITE CHAIN around the
     Vespa. At the same time, he takes out an RF KEY. He
     puts the key in the ignition, checks the BATTERY charge.

     Satisfied, The Killer shuts the Vespa off.
     He puts the key back in his pocket as he walks away.

     PASSERS-BY pay him no real attention as he goes.

               pass uneventfully. Let's go from

     The Killer hangs up. In a seemingly practiced move, as
     he lowers the hand holding the phone he DROPS the phone
     to the street. Without looking down, he steps...

     ...CRUSHING IT under his heel. He SIDE-KICKS the broken
     PIECES into the gutter as he walks away.

     In the SMALL PARK not far from where his Vespa's chained,
     The Killer is seated alone on an IRON BENCH.

               It's a dog eat dog world, to reuse

     He unwraps two EGG MCMUFFINS beside two plastic BAGS of
     APPLE SLICES.

The Killer disassembles his McMuffins, setting the
muffins into one WRAPPER, stacking the Canadian bacon and
disk-like eggs in the other.

          Every man for himself. Kill or be
          killed. Survival of the fittest.

He takes the apple slices, wraps the muffins in their
wrapper and in turn crumples them inside the carry-out
bag, as garbage.

Facing forward, the Killer eats what's salvaged; a
Ca nadian bacon sandwich with the two eggs for "bread."
Chews, swallows; consuming perfunctorily.

An OLD MAN in a WHEELCHAIR is seated beside his NURSE.
The NURSE SMOKES a CIGARETTE.

The Killer tears a bag of apple slices with his teeth,
squeezes pieces into his mouth. Chews, chews, swal lows.

     An O.S. SOUND of KEYS on a KEYCHAIN is HEARD. The Killer
     reacts, jerking his head to look, his eyes narrowing. He
     sets his rifle aside on the floor, leaping to his feet.

     In a lightless HALL, where the BATHROOM door is ajar, we

     The Killer brushes his teeth at the sink, using his
     stainless steel, collapsible cup to rinse and spit. He
     runs water over his TRAVEL TOOTHBRUSH, then folds it.

     He fills his COLLAPSABLE CUP. Drinks. Shakes the empty
     over the sink a few times to rid it of excess water. He
     re-collapses the cup, pockets it and the toothbrush.

               caseload.

     The Killer uses a small SPRAY BOTTLE of HAND SANITIZER,
     spraying in a circle to cleanse the entire sink and drain
     while the faucet's still running.

     ...The Killer AFFIXES the rifle's SCOPE.   Done.   Ready.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               My "process" is purely functional.
               Logistical. Narrowly focused, by
               design.

     He leans back in his chair, takes a small BOTTLE of
     EYEDROPS from his pocket, uncaps it.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               I'm not here to take sides. It's
               not my place to formulate any
               opinion.

     Head back, he DRIPS eyedrops into both eyes.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               No one who can afford me needs to
               waste time winning me to their
               cause.

     Capping and pocketing the eyedrops, The Killer levels his
     weapon so that just the barrel and front of the scope
     extend thru the curtain. He CHAMBERS a round.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               I serve no God or country. I fly
               no flag.

     While peering thru, The Killer ADJUSTS the scope.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               I'm effective because of one
               simple fact: I don't give a fuck.

     In the LIVING ROOM, Maid crosses right, towards the

     crossing left. The Killer pans left to follow the
     Bodyguards... into the FOYER, where...

     ...a grey haired, OLDER GENTLEMAN in a SUIT enters the
     flat, along with an attractive, DARK HAIRED WOMAN wearing
     a sleek, BLACK DRESS and STILETTOS.

     Dark Haired Woman carries a black VALISE, w hile the
     Killer's CROSSHAIRS fixate on Older Gentleman...

     ...following him as he talks to Dark Haired Woman and the
     Bodyguards, but... Older Gentleman steps beyond the
     window frame. He's still partially seen, REFLECTED in a
     large MIRROR, addressing his bodyguards.

     The Killer swallows, his breathing rapid. He sits back,
     inhaling deeply. He looks to his Fitbit, TAPS it.

     Fitbit's screen tells the tale: "104 bpm."

     He takes a deep breath, holds it, then lets out a few
     sharp exhalations thru his teeth -- attempting to calm.

                             THE KILLER (V.O.)
               At this range, a subsonic round's
               drop is not an issue. I'm just
               looking for a pulse rate under 60
               and a measured squeeze, so vintage
               glass won't alter trajectory.

     He checks at his Fitbit: "75 bpm."

     interesting items, but she takes out a CROP, which she
     places on the table.

     The Killer SWINGS RIGHT... to the BEDROOM curtain sliver.

      He stands, lifting his rifle. He KICKS the FOLDING
      CHAIR, which slides... across the floor.

      He bends while crossing, picks up the SHELL CASING...

      ...and he hurriedly disassembles the rifle as he goes;
      unscrewing the barrel with his Heatworx-gloved hand.

      Astride the duffel bag, he drops casing and smoldering
      rifle body, scope attached, onto the waiting towel. He
      closes the towel over it all, begins ZIPPING the duffel.

      The towel gets caught.   He unzips... re-zips.

      Hoisting the duffel bag by its shoulder strap, gun barrel
      still held, The Killer strides across the room. He
      stops, turns back... KICKS one rolled DROP CLOTH so it
      unrolls back into place over the open floor.

      He stashes his EARBUDS in his shirt, puts on his
      motorcycle helmet. He grabs his travel bag, slinging it

      Further on, there's a SOUND from below in the stairwell.
      The Killer halts, wary. He lets the barrel slide down,
      till he holds it now by one end -- a heavy cudgel.

      He peers down the center of the stairwell. Waits.
      After a moment, he keeps going, heading downward.

      The Killer pulls the folded plastic sheet and discards it

      He gets on the Vespa, leaving the chain and lock hanging.
      He takes out his key, uses it... but the cycle merely
      SPUTTERS.

      The Killer walks to a small, 24-HOUR GAS STATION.
      He keeps his distance from the CASHIER WINDOW, where a
      bored CASHIER reads a MAGAZINE.

      In this tiny BATHROOM, the shirtless Killer runs HOT
      WATER at the SINK while scrubbing his sudsy hands and
      forearms vigorously.

                Nitro. This much atomized nitro --
                might as well wash my eyes and
                shave my tongue. Gotta get rid of
                as much as possible.

      He pumps more gritty PINK SOAP from the DISPENSER, works
      his hands to clean underneath his fingernails. He bends
      to splash water on his face and begins washing his hair,
      neck and ears.

      The Killer, in BUCKET HAT and SUNGLASSES, with TRAVEL
      BAG, leaves the gas station behind.

      As he hits the sidewalk, he raises his hand, signaling
      O.S., gives a sharp, SHRILL WHISTLE.

      A TAXI glides to the curb, STOPS, discarding The Killer.

      As The Killer reaches the ENTRANCE, he takes out his HAND
      SANITIZER and approaches a TRASH CAN. Standing close to
      the receptacle, he surreptitiously removes the GLOCK from
      his back waistband.

      With both hands behind him, he SPRAYS hand sanitizer onto
      the gun, flips the gun in his palm, SPRAYS again, then
      TOSSES the Glock into the trash can.

      The Killer (in bucket hat) rises on an ESCALATOR to

      works a FLOOR POLISHER.

      Airport's busy now. The Killer waits in a LINE of PEOPLE
      wending to SECURITY. Looking ahead, he notices...

      TWO SECURITY OFFICERS chat, drinking take-out COFFEE.
      One of them holds the leash of a seated, bomb-sniffing,
      GERMAN SHEPARD. The men are caught up in their
      conversing, but the dog turns and...

      ...looks directly at The Killer.

      The Killer faces forward, shuffles along as the line
      advances. H e's next. A beat. The Killer glances at his
      Fitbit. Another beat. The Killer turns and heads...

      On his way in, The Killer drops his FITBIT in the TRASH.

      Many TRAVELERS now, getting FOOD and DRINK in the

      Jet's boarding. Again from deep in COACH, mostly alone
      amongst the earliest to board, The Killer has his head
      cocked to watch from his aisle seat as PASSENGERS FILE IN
      and stow CARRY-ON BAGS.

      endless FARMS.

      The Killer moves through a grouping of ramshackle
      BUILDINGS, including an "ENGINE" SHOP and a MARKET with
      "COCA-COLA" SIGNS. LOCALS, mostly Afro-Caribbean, tread
      the roadway and come and go from businesses.

      The Killer looks ahead to a wide, dirt ROADWAY...
      SIGNS say "PRIVATE ROAD," and "NO TRESPASSING" in
      Spanish, Creole, French, a few other languages.

      ON THE DIRT ROAD:

      The Killer takes this private road, journeying deeper

      The Jeep stops beside a keypad CALL BOX, with a closed
      GATE ahead. The Killer leans to the keypad, but notices
      something. He gets out, walks, seeing...

      There are A DOZEN crushed CIGARETTE BUTTS in the dirt.

      Enough for him.   The Killer returns to his Jeep.

      The Killer enters a clearing on fairly sizable plot of
      land. Ahead, his house is a jaw-dropper of modern
      architecture, with coastal BEACH FRONT visible through a
      break in the tree line beyond.

      There's much floor-to-ceiling GLASS in the structure.
      Yet despite darkening skies overhead, not one light on.

      Also adding to The Killer's rising dread...

      The Killer, gun ready, circles around from the side of
      the house, crouched to minimize the target area of his
      body, watchful as he approaches. His lips peel from his
      clenched teeth when he sees...

      The Killer enters, gun first.
      No sign of anyone in this OPEN LOUNGE-AREA, but the place
      is TRASHED. LAMPS lie BROKEN. DRAWERS pulled and

      He looks to BUTCHER KNIFES scattered on the floor with
      the wood block KNIFE HOLDER that held them lying nearby.

      The Killer backtracks, heads into a HALL..

      The condition of the BATHROOM tells of struggle. BLOOD
      and the LIQUID contents of BROKEN PERFUME BOTTLES mingle
      amongst SHARDS of BROKEN MIRROR on the floor.

      There's a SMEAR of CRIMSON across the seat of the closed
      toilet. The Killer lowers his gun... hesitating for the

      Stepping back, with glass CRUNCHING underfoot, The Killer
      only now notices that by the SINK...

      ...is a somewhat diminutive, unmistakably BAREFOOT,
      FOOTPRINT in BLOOD on the COUNTERTOP.

      The Killer looks up to the small, rectangular WINDOW
      above the sink, which is open to the SOUND of JUNGLE.

      At the open passenger door...

      In this small room, with paint peeling on the walls, a
      grim man, MARCUS, in his 30's, sits with his hands
      clenched, at the BEDSIDE of MAGDALA, 34 - 40, who sleeps,
      hooked to IVs and MONITORS.

      BANDAGED Magdala is unconscious, with a TUBE up her nose.

                There were two of them.
                She can describe them. It's not
                like they were disguising

      Magdala's still sleeping, monitors quietly BEEPING.
      The Killer is now in the vigil chair Marcus previously

                She is well enough to travel.

                to the private hospital in Punta

      The Killer stands. He takes out a CASH, rips bills off
      and offers them, waiting for Female Doctor to take the
      mon ey. Female Doctor merely walks away. The Killer puts
      the money back in his pocket, turns... seeing...

      Magdala's awake. He goes to her. Magdala holds out her
      hand, reaching to him, trying to sit up.

                Nothing. You'd've been proud. I

                You need to rest.

      Magdala breathes in sharply as she lays back, pained.

      Then, as if realizing the extent of her injuries, she
      slowly raises a hand towards her battered features.

                this; if I didn't survive... I'd
                never see you again. I couldn't
                bear that.
                     (quietly, eyes closing)
                So, I di d. Somehow I did it.

      Magdala eases back into unconsciousness. The Killer
      lowers his head, gripping Magdala's hand more tightly.

      With his house behind and a SHOVEL over his shoulder, The
      Killer, in T-SHIRT and TRACK SUIT PANTS, marches across
      his property, heading toward JUNGLE.
                                                             42.

      The Killer's digging near jungle's edge, uncovering a
      square of shallowly buried PLYWOOD, which he works the
      shovel at the edge of... prying it loose.

      He tosses the shovel. He gets on his knees to get a good
      grip... flips the wood aside. Beneath is a layer of
      waxed, water-proofed CANVAS. The Killer pulls this back -
      - revealing a small SAFE embedded in poured CONCRETE.

      The Killer presses his HAND to the THUMB-PRINT ID PAD.

      He twists the HANDLE, opening the safe.
      INSIDE: are CREDIT CARDS, PASSPORTS and two GLOCK
      HANDGUNS (each sealed in ZIP-LOCK BAGS), along with a few
      other necessities. The Killer takes one Glock.

      He tears the plastic, examines the gun, sets it aside.
      He bends forward to take other items.

      The Killer enters, crossing. The place is work-in-
      progress, but UNIFORMED HOUSEKEEPERS work; SCRUBBING the
      FLOOR and replacing ITEMS on SHELVES. The Killer passes
      TWO other HOUSEKEEPERS carrying out a rolled-up RUG.

      The Killer enters the bedroom, which is still much as he
      found it, though a UNIFORMED HOUSEKEEPER steam-CLEANS the
      CURTAINS. The Killer takes a JACKET from the bed and a
      (burner) SMART PHONE. He stows the GLOCK in his packed
      TRAVEL BAG, which he ZIPS and shoulders.

      The Killer crosses back thru the house, tying the jacket
      around his waist. He exits towards his parked JEEP.

      passes is ORANGE with official YELLOW TRIANGLE EMBLEMS.

      The Killer remains vigilant, looking all around as he
      drives. He stops for a RED LIGHT. The CROSS TRAFFIC
      ahead tells a familiar tale... ORANGE TAXI here... ORANGE
      TAXI there... ORANGE TAXIS everywhere.

      The Killer walks along a thoroughfare, where MANY ORANGE
      TAXIS are parked in a line. When a YELLOW TAXI passes in
      the street, The Killer turns to watch it pass.

      The Killer crosses the park, heading for a central, domed
      BANDSTAND, passing FOOD CART VENDORS, BLUE and WHITE
      COLLAR WORKERS on break, and wandering TOURISTS.

      At the bandstand, The Killer climbs the stairs.
      From this higher vantage point, he looks to where...

      A LINE of TAXIS waits on a side street.

      Something catches his ear and he looks up.

      A small, PRIVATE JET rumbles by in the sky.

      The Killer drives up to a relatively modest TERMINAL
      BUILDING. The Killer IDLES and...

      FROM THE JEEP:

      ...he looks across to the right hand side of the road,

      The Killer stares, considering for a protracted moment.

      with a single RUNWAY beyond, there are TWO crappy,

      In a rough section of town, we find the dilapidated
      "BESTTIME TAXI" OFFICE, with attached (closed) GARAGE and
      GREEN TAXIS parked in front. Late night streets are
      deserted, except...

      The Killer approaches from up the block.

      He wears a KNIT CAP, glances around as he nears the
      office. He tries the DOOR. It's locked. He KNOCKS.

      After a moment, SOMEONE pulls aside the BLINDS to look
      out the WINDOW by the door.

      Seems they're waving The Killer off, but The Killer makes
      prayer hands, holds up a finger to show it will only take
      a moment. BLINDS SHUT.

      As The Killer turns to face the door, he takes a HANDGUN
      from his pants pocket and pulls his cap -- oh, it's a SKI
      MASK -- down over his face. The moment the door opens...

      The Killer's forcing his way in.   Shuts the door behind.

      takes down "CONDUCTORES."

      Garage is still open, with a GREEN TAXI sticking halfway

      From up the block, LEO RODRIQUEZ, hair longer than in his

      Across from a HOTEL where LOCALS and TOURISTS seem to be

      climbs in back. Leo's taxi pulls into TRAFFIC.

      Leo's taxi heads out of town... merging onto sparsely
      trafficked ROAD which bisects the portside traffic.

      MUSIC plays from the BOOMBOX up front. The Killer,
      seated in the middle of the rear seat, leans forward to
      rap a knuckle on the open, yellowed SECURITY PARTITION.
      Leo, driving, doesn't notice.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                This is what it takes...

      The Killer takes out his silenced GLOCK -- uses it to TAP
      on the partition, holds it there. This Leo hears,
      turning the MUSIC DOWN while glancing over his shoulder.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                ...what you must commit yourself
                to, if you want to succeed.

      Seeing the gun, Leo faces front; looking in the REARVIEW
      MIRROR. The Killer gestures to look forward.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Simple.

      The BOOMBOX still quietly plays MUSIC while a nervous Leo
      navigates light traffic at the behest of The Killer.

                              LEO
                Awwww shit man... I... I just came
                on. Small change is all I got.

      Leo's looking up to address the KILLER'S SUNGLASS-hidden
      EYES in the REARVIEW MIRROR.

                              LEO
                I'm gonna show you... okay?

      Careful to be telegraphing, Leo digs a WALLET from his
      jeans. He makes a show of holding it open with h is free
      hand and offering; only SMALL BILLS inside.

                              LEO
                ...take it, man.

      The Killer reaches thru to take the wallet.

                               LEO
                 There's a condom in there too.
                 What's mine is yours. Leave the
                 wallet if you're feeling generous.
                 What else...? Want my radio?

       The Killer pockets the wallet, takes off his sunglasses.

                               THE KILLER
                 Tell me about your big fare, Leo,
                 three days ago.

       IN THE REARVIEW: Leo's questioning eyes.

                                LEO
                 What?   Three days?   I --

       The Killer CHAMBERS a ROUND, sits forward and presses the
       gun against the back of Le o's skull. Leo shuts one eye,
       keeping the other on the roadway.

                               LEO
                 Wait, wait, wait... don't, okay.
                 Wait. I-I tell you. The freak
                 and the lady, right? From the
                 little airport. That's who?

       The Killer lowers his gun, sits back.
       Leo, sweating, opens his eye, gathers himself.

                               LEO
                 I got them like, noon. I

                  kept him on a chain. He was a
                  scary motherfucker.

       The Killer sets his gun down on the seat beside him.

                  Walk me through your time with
                  them, to the best of your
                  recollection.

                                LEO
                  No problem. I drove them, is all.
                  They were sight-seeing, I thought,
                  at first. Because they hadn't
                  given me an address. We're
                  supposed to get an address.
                  Roundtrip, was what th ey said.
                  Then, they told me: north on DR-1.
                  Then deep into the jungle, like...
                  forever.

       With a sigh, Leo white knuckles the wheel, pondering.

                                LEO
                  They showed me on Google, and I
                  drove them. They wouldn't take
                  "no" for an answer. We got to a
                  gate, private property, and I was
                  told to wait.

       He's staring out thru the windshield, troubled.

       The merest frown from The Killer as he listens, looking
       to watch the foliage passing outside.

                               LEO
                 They came back, the guy's leg was
                 bloody. They wanted me to take
                 them back to airport, so I did.
                      (to REARVIEW)
                 That was the end of it.

       Leo glances to his CIGARETTE PACK, grabs them up.

                      (of CIGARETTES)
                 Mind if I...? Want one?

       He shakes out a cigarette, pushes the CAR LIGHTER in.

                               LEO
                 Ask me anything. Any thing. I
                 don't know who they are. Don't
                 want to know. Don't want to know
                 who you are either, con todo
                 respeto.

       The lighter POPS. Leo uses it, inhales deeply, exhales.

       Leo slows the taxi to a STOP.

                               LEO
                 If they did you wrong somehow, I'm
                 sorry. I truly am. But I've got
                 nothing to do with anything,
                 except I happened to be first in
                 line. Because I didn't go to
                 lunch.
                      (glances back)
                 So, how about... I get out and I
                 leave the keys?

       He turns the engine off, then removes the KEYS from the
       ignition and throws them up on the dashboard.

                               LEO
                 I'll walk back to town, easy. You
                 take it all, man. It's yours.

      The taxi's front windows are instantaneously covered in
      BLOOD, BRAIN and SKULL FRAGMENTS. Gun smoke wafts. The
      back door opens. The Killer steps out, pocketing the gun
      while using a HANDKERCHIEF to wipe the inner door handle.
      He elbows the door shut, wipes the outer handle. He goes
      to open the front passenger door. We HEAR the MUSIC shut

      D BATTERIES. He swaps these for fresh batteries, screws

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                I like to imagine, once I'm gone
                and the automatic payments have
                dried up, the episode of "Storage
                Wars" where they cut the lock on
                one of mine and get a look inside.

      The Killer dials a COMBINATION on a medium sized,
      portable DOCUMENT SAFE. Opens it, revealing a
      GLOCK HANDGUN, AMMO and CASH inside.
      He takes the Glock and money.

      At one SHELF, The Killer grabs some ZIP-TIES from a
      CONTAINER, pockets them. He takes down a BOX containing
      several SETS of LICENSE PLATES, selects a PAIR, puts them
      under his arm. On the next shelf, he finds large DECALS
      of the UNIVERSAL SYMBOLS for 'CORROSIVE,' 'HAZARDOUS
      MATERIALS' and 'MEDICAL WASTE.' He selects one with the
      'RECYCLING' SYMBOL beside "FOR SHREDDING."

      The Killer exits his unit, shuts the door.

      TWO YOUNG DAY LABORERS hustle across the PARKING LOT from
      a HARDWARE SUPER-STORE, each with a grip on one handle of
      the quite large (and seemingly weighty), grey
      SHREDDER/RECYCLING BIN they're WHEELING behind them.

      Arriving at the open rear of the white van where The
      Killer waits, Laborer One and Laborer Two stop, setting
      the SHREDDER BIN straight. Laborer One happily accepts
      CASH The Killer hands over while Two throws open the
      bin's hinged lid... revealing OTHER PURCHASED ITEMS...

      The Killer and Laborer One and Two load those OTHER ITEMS
      into the back of the van: a medium-sized, plastic COOLER;
      a somewhat unwieldy BOX containing a cordless FRAMING
      GUN; a big, heavy BUCKET of QUIKRETE.

      Amongst smaller, less impressive structures at DOWNTOWN's
      outskirts, The Killer's van is parked on a corner.

      IN THE VAN:

      The Killer, in BASEBALL CAP, is behind the wheel,
      observing the world.

      THE KILLER'S POV:

      WORKERS are coming and going, mostly coming, at a catty
      corner, dark but plain, post-war OFFICE BUILDING.

      IN THE VAN:

      The Killer takes a BANANA from a 7-11 BAG on the
      passenger seat, peels the ban ana entirely, puts the peel
      back in the bag.

      POV:

      A city BUS stops at a BUS STOP across the street from the
      office building and begins letting off RIDERS.

      IN THE VAN:

      The Killer, chewing the last of the banana, keeps looking
      while he reaches to get a large BOTTLE of vanilla ENSURE
      from the bag. He twists the BOTTLE open, gulps Ensure.

      POV:

      Amongst the dispersing RIDERS is a bespectacled, middle-
      aged wo man, DOLORES, carrying her PURSE and a COMPUTER
      BAG. She looks both ways, venturing into the crosswalk.

      IN THE VAN:

      The Killer lowers the bottle, observing Dolores.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Hello, Dolores. Miss me?

      POV:

      Dolores addresses a SECURITY CAMERA somewhere inside the
      entry doors, it seems, pantomiming 'HELLO.'

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                A CCTV and a 100-dollar, electric,
                dead-latch lock.

                Century problems.

      Dolores is BUZZED in... disappears into the building.

      IN THE VAN:

      The Killer slumps, settling in, sips Ensure.

      INSIDE THE VAN:

      The Killer remains, now with an EARPOD in one ear, trying
      to stay focused.

      He leans slightly to check his right SIDE MIRROR.

      He tilts his head, eyeballing his left SIDE MIRROR.

      POV IN VAN SIDE MIRROR:

      A FEDEX DELIVERY TRUCK is heading this direction.

      INSIDE THE VAN:

      The Killer removes his ear pod, gets out.

      The Killer goes to open the rear of the van as the FedEx
      truck passes. The Killer grabs the grey bin (SHREDDING
      stickered) by its handles, pulling it out.

      ACROSS THE INTERSECTION:

      The FedEx truck parks in the LOADING ZONE in front of the
      dark but plain, post-war building. Its BLINKERS FLASH.

      The Killer starts across the intersection, wheeling his
      shredder bin. He picks up the pace, while ahead...

      A FedEx DELIVERY MAN, carrying ENVELOPES, stops at the
      entrance where Dolores arrived. He's looking up and in
      at the unseen SECURITY CAMERA, nodding. Door BUZZES. As
      he pulls the door open and enters, he hears a shrill,
      SHARP WHISTLE and "Hold the door."

      The Killer's hustling, giving a wave.

      Delivery Man HOLDS THE DOOR as The Killer and his
      somewhat unwieldy bin arrive.

                                                          CUT TO:

      ELEVATOR's in motion. The Killer stands behind his bin.
      Delivery Man's occupied scanning envelope BAR CODES into
      his FedEx TRACKER.

      The LIT button for "4" goes OUT.   DING.

      Elevator arrives, DOORS OPENING. The Killer guides his
      shredder bin out and maneuvers to park it out of the way.
      Delivery Man meanwhile is headed towards the end of the
      hall, passing OFFICES.

      The Killer occupies himself by nonchalantly taking out
      GLOVES and slipping them on, watches over his shoulder...

      Delivery Man arrives at the last OFFICE DOOR. The door
      has in-laid, full-length SECURITY GLASS . "EDWARD HODGES,
      INTERNATIONAL TRADE ATTORNEY" is PAINTED on the glass,
      "BY APPOINTMENT ONLY." Delivery Man presses a DOORBELL,
      looking in. He gets BUZZED in.

      IN THE 4TH FLOOR HALL:

      The Killer opens the bin and takes out a flat, plastic
      TOOL CASE. He approaches the office door as it SHUTS.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)

                1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

      The Killer cautiously leans to look.

      THR U THE GLASS: Delivery Man greets Dolores as she rises
      from her DESK to one side of the wood paneled OUTER
      OFFICE. Dolores accepts a FEDEX ENVELOPE. Delivery Man
      has her sign the SCREEN of his TRACKER.

      The Killer retreats a few steps, leans against the wall,
      taking out his PHONE. He pretends to be engrossed in it.
      Delivery Man exits the office, walks back to the
      elevators, not noticing The Killer, who pockets his phone
      as the DOOR is SWINGING shut but...

      The Killer's already stepping up to...

      ...JAM his toe in at the last possible second.

      Dolores is tearing the ENVELOPE open and looking confused
      upon finding it empty. The Killer enters, shutting the
      door behind. He puts down his case, takes out his GUN.

                              THE KILLER
                Dolores.

      Dolores turns to see him. Horrified.

      The Killer retrieves his tool case and steps forward.
      He motions with the Glock that Dolores should move from
      behind her desk. She does so.

      Stepping behind the desk himself, The Killer places his
      case down flat. He takes Dolores' PHONE, puts it in his
      poc ket. He pushes her LAPTOP shut, places it on top of
      his case and picks both up. He motions for Dolores to
      continue towards a large, closed WOODEN DOOR.

      Dolores acquiesces, going to stand before it.

      The Killer glances down to her work station, steps to...

      ...depress a SWITCH beneath the desk with his foot.

      A BUZZ is HEARD; a LOCK UNLATCHES. The wooden door is
      pushed inwards as a contrite Dolores enters.

                              DOLORES
                I'm... I'm sorry, sir...

      In this large, also wood-paneled OFFICE, somewhat rough-
      around-the-edges, 50-something EDWARD HODGES looks up in
      annoyance from his LAPTOP at his big DESK.

                              HODGES
                What is it, Dolores?

      He sees The Killer following Dolores in, stunned.

          Good God.

The Killer aims at Hodges (whose voice we should
recognize as the VOICE OVER THE PHONE The Killer spoke
with earlier) and kicks the DOOR SHUT behind.

                        HODGES
          What could you possibly be
          thinking, coming here?

The Killer drops the tool case and Dolores' laptop on a
COUCH, gently places a hand on Dolores, guiding her.

                         HODGES
          This is very unlike you, my
          friend. Care to explain yourself?
          Be cause I cannot...

The Killer brings fearful Dolores to Hodges, takes out
TWO ZIP-TIES, hands them to her. He points to Hodges'
hand resting on the arm of his wheeled DESK CHAIR.

                        HODGES
          ...Conceive of anything I have to
          offer that could remotely be worth
          the exposure on your part.
               (of Dolores' hesitation)
          Go ahead, dear; whatever he says.

Dolores reluctantly begins ZIP-TYING her boss's wrists to
the cha ir arms. Hodges tries to remain calm.

                        HODGES
               (to The Killer)
          Insanity. There's no other word
          for this. Insanity. Surely you
          can't be angry with me.

                        DOLORES
               (to Hodges)
          I'm so sorry. I opened the outer
          door for FedEx...

                        HODGES
          Dolores, I'm the one who's sorry.
          I sincerely apologize.

The Killer yanks one tie to make it tighter, then brings
Dolores as he crosses. He opens a DOOR leading to a
sizable EX ECUTIVE WASHROOM, replete with SHOWER.

                Dolores, I promise you. Once he
                realizes the folly of his actions.

      Dolores watches, tears welling, as The Killer proceeds to
      zip-tie her wrist to the METAL TOWELBAR mounted, waist-
      high, in front of the sink.

      The Killer reenters, shuts the bathroom door.

      Now that they're alone in Hodges' office, The Killer and
      Hodges turn their undivided attention to each other.

                              HODGES
                You went home. How could you
                have, realizing my hands would
                be... ?
                     (glances down, flustered)
                You had to have known -- you
                must've -- that I'd have no say in
                the matter going forward and
                still, you went home.

                              THE KILLER
                Who were they?

      Hodges lo oks incredulous.

                              HODGES
                Who were they? First of all: who
                cares? I barely glanced at the
                invoice. Which, if I may say, is
                very much beside the point. The
                consequences, when someone's wide
                of the mark, are automatic.
                However regrettable, they are an
                obligation to client and calling.

At the couch, The Killer sits, takes up the molded
plastic tool case, which he opens.

                        HODGES
          I was forced to be make amends by
          a very angry, very powerful man --
          never in my wildest imagination
          did I think you'd actually go
          home... not in a million years.

The Killer takes out his NAIL GUN and BATTERY PACK. He
slaps the battery into the gun's hilt. Hodges swallows,
but he's not the type to let anyon e see him sweat.

Still seated, The Killer closes Hodges' laptop, puts
Dolores' laptop on top, aligns the nail gun against where
the hard drives reside, and presses in quick succession --
PSST-THUNK PSST-THUNK PSST-THUNK -- so THREE long NAILS
impale them together.

                        HODGES
          Why would you -- ? That's just...
          childish. The good news is, it's
          not too late. Even now, this
          entire debacle can be salvaged.
          But only if you disappear. Which
          is what I assumed you'd've already
          done.

The Killer stands and crosses, bringing the nail gun.

                        HODGES
          You've got more money than you can
          ever spend. Thanks in no small
          part to me, so, why aren't you
          already on the other side of the
          globe, under any number of
          aliases, spending it?

The Killer stands before Hodges' desk.

                        HODGES
          You don't believe me; don't feel
          you can trust me. Fine. I've
          brought that on myself. But after
          all these years -- having built
          this from the ground up -- I
          thought we had a relationship.

He swaps the nail gun to his left hand.

                        THE KILLER
          I know you have back-up records
          here, Eddie, on me, everyone; the
          whole shebang...

The Killer starts around the desk.

                        THE KILLER
          ...because you'd never put it on
          the cloud, any more than you'd
          trust it outside these four walls.

                        HODGES
          There's nothing like that.
          Everything was on those two
          laptops. And now... it's not.

The Killer stands over the lawyer, his unwavering gaze
fixed upon Hodges .

                        HODGES
          Who do you think you're trying to
          intimidate? It wouldn't make any
          sense for you to pull that
          trigger. There's no upside.

Okay, despite his resolute defiance, Hodges is sweating.

                        HODGES
          The only logical choice for you is
          to turn around, right now, and
          walk out that door. Embrace your
          next life.   I wish you well.

The Killer lowers the gun and brings the nail gun up
against Hodges' chest -- P SST-THUNK PSST-THUNK PSST-THUNK
-- fires THREE nails. Hodges sucks in a long GASP.

Hodges' eyes go wide with terror as he rears up in the
chair and his tied hands claw air. Pinning his shirt to
his chest are the THREE tiny HEADS of the NAILS sunken
deeply in nearly bloodless puncture wounds.

Hodges WHEEZES, struggling to breathe, as The emotionless
Killer places the nail gun down on the desk.

                        THE KILLER
          You'll drown, slowly... and I'll
          dispose of you...

 The Killer picks up Hodges phone.

                          THE KILLER
            ...so while a few fragments of
            your side hustle may be left to
            puzzle over...

Hodges' bulging eyes watch as The Killer, turning the
PHONE ON, holds the phone up for Hodges to see...

                          THE KILLER
            ...since you'll have completely
            vanished, the trail ends where it
            began...

CLOSE-UP:

ON THE PHONE: The Killer's finger brings up the
"Emergency Call" window and KEYPAD.

                         THE KILLER
            ...unless:

CLOSE-UP:

ON TH E PHONE: The Killer keys in "911."

IN HODGES' OFFICE

The Killer places the phone at the edge of the desk, near
Hodges, with "911" on the bright screen ready and waiting
-- if only someone would press the GREEN BUTTON to dial.

Hodges pitches back and forth, sucking air as best he
can. His mouth works horribly, wordlessly.

The Killer takes a step back, raising his arms and
turning his head; makes a sho w of looking around.

                          THE KILLER
            I need the information Edward, and
            you're running out of time.

Hodges grunts and WHEEZES, his eyes locked on "911" --
bobbing his head in desperation at the phone.

The Killer, seeing Hodges teetering, moves around the
desk, coming to tip everything off the DESK's BLOTTER and
to grab a COPY of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

The Killer begins a grotesque pantomime, crossing to
g esture towards several PAINTINGS on the wall. While
giving Hodges a questioning look, he looks behind one
painting. Finding nothing, he moves on... goes to throw
open the DOORS of a LIQUOR CABINET, gives a "?" SHRUG.

                                                        65.


Hodges watches, beginning to GURGLE, shakes his head.

The Killer goes to put a hand over FILE CABINETS, looking
for Hodges to clue him in while moving his hand over one
after another -- like a game of "Colder Warmer Hotter."

Hodges shakes his head desperately, "no no no." He
cranes his neck and NODS insistently to across the room.

The Killer crosses to stand before FOUR long SHELVES full
of LAW CAS EBOOKS, LAW ENCYCLOPEDIAS and STATUTE TOMES.

Hodges, whose breathing grows wetter by the moment, makes
a big show of nodding his head up and down, "yes yes."

The Killer looks up at all those many books. Looks back
to Hodges, points to the books to the left, points to
books to the right, again looks questioningly.

Hodges has had enough. He jerks frantically forwards in
his chair, wheeling it a bit w hile turning the seat. He
begins THRUSTING all his weight forward, repeatedly --
his zip-tied hand grasping all the while for the PHONE...
that "911" tantalizingly close, but out of reach.

The desk chair TOPPLES...
Hodges HITS the floor hard, on his side.

Hodges, with both hands still zipped to the chair, is
feebly stuck there, eyes closed, a GURGLING fish out of
water. The Killer kneels beside, opening the NEWSPAPER
beneath Hodges' head as Hodges chokes up BLOODY SPITTLE.

The Killer next positions the NEWSPAPER beneath Hodges'
waist, under Hodges' urine-soaked haunches.

                        HODGES
               (chok ing)
          I... never... liked you.

The Killer rises, looking down to inspect his work.

                        THE KILLER (V.O.)
          Three, 9-gauge nails. Early
          middle-aged non-smoker. About a
          hundred and eighty pounds. Should
          last... six, seven minutes...

Hodges is still breathing, but quite shallowly.

The Killer picks up Hodges' phone. Turns it OFF.
He puts it in his pocket as he steps over Hodges.

       Coming to stand before the BOOKSHELVES, The Killer gives
       a daunted sigh. CRACKS a few gloved KNUCKLES. He goes
       to take out the far right BOOK from the bottom shelf;
       begins his search there.

       He opens the book, FANS the pages, replaces it. He takes
       the next book to the left, fans it, replaces it. Same
       with the next book left; searching every single book.

       The Killer pauses, looking over his shoulder.

       On the floor where he fell, Hodges lies motionless.
       His open eyes are dull and lifeless.

                               DOLORES (O.S.)
                 Thompson Reuter's Eleventh
                 Edition!

       The Killer reacts... s cans the shelves -- pulls the
       Thompson book and finds a hidden NICHE CARVED OUT in the
       book's pages. Therein resides a small LEDGER.

       The Killer pries out the LEDGER, regards it.

          Trust no one.

Zip-tied Dolores leaning back against the SINK.
Her mascara has run, but she's all cried out.

The Killer notices the MEDICINE CABINET MIRROR ajar.
He reaches to take a PILL BOTTLE from Dolores' fist,
which she allows without struggle. He reads it:

                            "HODGES, EDWARD

                             ALPRAZOLAM

                             XANAX .25mg"

The Killer shakes the bottle, hears a few pills rattling.
He tosses it into the sink.

                        DOLORES
          I'd beg... if I thought it would
          do any good.

She looks to The Killer, who gives nothing; to which
Dolores lowers her head, swallows, regrouping.

                        DOLORES
          I have the names you're looking
          for... I know who "they" were...

          But, before I give them to you,
          I... I want something in return...

          I know what you're capable of --

          but promise me you won't leave
          things looking... the wrong way.
          Please.

The Killer waits.

                         DOLORES
          I don't make the kind of money you
          and Edwar d do. Not by a long

       She swallows misery, struggling to maintain composure.

       The Killer's expression still betrays nothing.

      Man and Woman exit, walking away. The Killer backs out

      ...at her HAND zip-tied to the dashboard's GRAB HANDLE.

      The Killer's staring forward. This is how they remain,
      in silence, for a protracted moment.

      The Killer gets out, leaving Dolores, who we briefly
      glimpse. The Killer strides up the WALKWAY to the FRONT
      PORCH. At the FRONT DOOR, he uses KEYS to enter. As
      soon as he's in, the shadowy FIGURE of DOLORES can be
      seen making every effort to YANK her tied hand free. All

      struggles, alas in vain... until the SOUND of the

      Dolores is seated on the BED, hands on her knees with
      fingers spread, eyes staring off; slightly out-of-it.

                                DOLORES
                  ... was November 28th.   So, go to
                  "N."

      The Killer, at Dolores' particle board SECTIONAL DESK and
      incongruously surrounded by her framed FAMILY PHOTOS, is
      seated facing Dolores, with a big, open-circular, large-
      format ROLODEX on his knee, which he starts spinning.

                                DOLORES
                  Under "N," in nu merical order,
                  find... eleven twenty-eight. One
                  one two eight, and...

      The Killer does so his fingers flicking through the
      ROLODEX CARDS behind the "N" TAB. All the many cards are
      covered in myriad, different colored HANDWRITTEN
      NOTATIONS, with some TYPED INFO and cross-outs and
      scribbled additions.

                                DOLORES
                  You'll recognize the address.

      The Killer stops at one CARD, takes it out to examine:

      11-28*              3 Rue du Grev
      acct. CH-2315       Paris, France

                           560211453

                                DOLORES
                  Because of... what occurred,
                  there's an addendum at the bottom.
                  Should be two wire transfer
                  routing numbers, for the sub-
                  contractors you're interested in.
                  What's the first?

                                 THE KILLER
                       (reading from CARD)
                  Eight, eight , nine--

          "E."
               (gestures, WIGGLING
                her fingers)
          Numerically again.

(PROPS NOTE - Dolores files many cards numerically,
NUMBERS at the top NOT spelled out, but still under the
letter each first number starts with -- "E" for 8, in
this example. There would also be an alphabetical section
before or after the numerical sections, under each tab,
with names and other coded words - all creating a
glorious, indecipherable-mess-only-Dolores-can-
understand... and, since she files a lot of stuff by wire
transfer routing numbers, there will likely be more cards
under O,T,F,S, E and N than under others, thank you!)

The Killer places the CARD on the corner of the desk,
searches the ROLODEX to "E,"... finds:

   889300295                     560211453

   Beacon, NY 12508              St. Petersburg, FL 33703

He plucks the TWO CARDS, glances up.

Dolores seems barely able to keep her eyes open.

The Killer looks back down at the first card... turns it
over, to find more masculine HANDWRITING:

    paid in full

    Claybourne, H
    450 E. Wallace Ave./ PH
    Chicago, IL 60654

                           THE KILLER
          Claybourne?

Without turning, Dolores' eyes look over matter of fact.

                           DOLORES
          The client.

The Killer absorbs this.    He extracts this ROLODEX CARD.

His hand closes over the CARD on the desk as he stands.

Pocketing the TWO CARDS, The Killer looks to Dolores.
She's looking to him. He motions for her to come.

      Dolores gets to her feet.   She walks to The Killer.

      The Killer steps aside, gesturing for Dolores to go thru
      the doorway. She does, leading the way into a DARK HALL.
      Her own expression has come to match The Killer's
      emotionless example.

      The Killer follows behind.
      It is a slow walk down a relatively short hallway.

      As Dolores nears the STAIRWELL.

      ...The Killer is upon her -- reaching to TWIST Dolores'
      head violently. The SNAP of her neck is actually
      audible, or was it our imagination? Nevertheless...

      The Killer throws his hands open, releasing Dolores so
      suddenly that she teeters upright a moment, impossibly; a
      marionette with cut stings, then...

      Her body goes headlong down the stairs in a sickening,
      somersa ulting TUMBLE of flopping limbs, snapping bones
      and skin-splitting impacts.

      She SLAMS to a halt in a bent, broken heap below. It's
      scant solace that she was dead before the fall began.

      The Killer, in his van, leans out to NO-TOUCH-TOOL-poke
      buttons on the mounted KEYPAD, which BEEPS. GATE RISES.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)

      By the shadowy LIGHT of surrounding LED LANTERNS on the
      floor, The Killer wheels the large grey bin containing
      Hodges' corpse to beside the QUIKRETE bucket and cooler
      at the center of a large, PLASTIC DROPCLOTH laid out.

      The Killer crosses to the SHELVES.   Takes some zip-ties.

      He goes to grab a UTILITY TUB propped near the industrial
      DRUMS, slides that over to beside the QUIKRETE.

                Don't want a puzzle solved?
                Remove a piece or two. Scatter
                the rest.

      At other SHELVES, he drags down, from amongst a few other
      pieces of LUGGAGE, a large, hard-walled FOOTLOCKER.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                What's the expression? Measure
                twice, cut once.

      He steps to his TOOL RACK. Takes down a long-handled
      TROWEL, and lastly... a large, jagged-toothed SAW.

      The Killer drives, attentive to the HIGHWAY before him.

      IN THE BACK OF THE VAN:

      A HANDTRUCK and a few flat MOVING BOXES are bungie-corded
      to the wall. There are three items at the center of the
      van: the COOLER, the FOOTLOCKER, and a SHOVEL.

      The Killer's van pulls in behind THREE VEHICLES already
      waiting at the FERRY TERMINAL.

      FERRY CREWMEN and CREWWOMEN in YELLOW VESTS wave them on.

      The Killer follows as the vehicles pull onto the deck,
      where they tandem park, close along the right RAIL.

      Some PASSENGERS are on the bow, watching waves crash in
      foredeck FLOOD LIGHTS, chatting with DECK CREW.

      Mid-ship, where the white van is situated in relative
      darkness between empty CARS, the van's right hand SIDE
      DOOR SLIDES OPEN. The Killer gets out, holding the
      heavy cooler by its handle. He looks around.

      He goes to lean his elbows on the railing, with the
      cooler in his hands over the rail, looking to the water.

      He glances around once more... lets the cooler drop.
      Climbing back in thru the van's side door, The Killer
      turns back, takes out a PHONE and TOSSES it over the rail
      into the water. He SLIDES the door SHUT.

      HIGHWAY VEHICLES are only faintly HEARD here. The Killer
      drags the FOOTLOCKER past a dirt MOUND to a fresh HOLE.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Even I have to occasionally remind
                myself... the only life-path is

      He unceremoniously topples the footlocker in.

      The Killer goes to get his SHOVEL.

      On the BEDSIDE TABLE, beside The Killer's collapsible,
      metal CUP and MULTI-TOOL key chained to his NO-TOUCH-
      TOOL, an ALARM CLOCK reads: 2:33 PM.

      Sunlight flares around closed CURTAINS. The Killer
      sleeps on his back. His arms out of the sheet, at his
      sides. No pillows. Those are stacked on the other BED
      beside his travel bag and tomorrow's CLOTHES.

      He sleeps deeply, despite the boisterous O.S. SHRIE KING,
      his eyes busily REMing back and forth under his eyelids.

      The Fitbit on his wrist READS an unusual "101 bpm."

      Behind the wheel, The Killer reaches to take a peeled,
      HARD BOILED EGG from the paper Starbucks BAG on the
      passenger seat. He puts it in his mouth, chews. He
      reaches to get another EGG. He swallows. Puts the 2nd
      in his mouth, chews.

      He takes a Venti STARBUCKS COFFEE from th e center DRINK

      In the bay of a SELF-SERVE CAR WASH, with the van's rear
      and side doors open, The Killer climbs into the back,
      dragging the WASHER GUN and trailing HOSE which he whips
      to gain slack. He pulls the trigger, unleashing the
      WATER SPRAY -- BLASTING the van clean from inside out.

       A single story, CORNER HOUSE, surrounded by CHAINLINK
       FENCE. TWO MUSCLE CARS and a slick CYCLE out front.

       There's no one in the weedy FRONT YARD, but...

                                THE KILLER (V.O.)
                 Florida.   The Sunshine State.

       ...as The Killer turns the corner, looking without being
       conspicuous, it's a different story in the SIDE YARD.
       TWO gangster-wannabes hang out with a muscular, shirtless
       freak in GYM SHORTS we'll call T HE BRUTE.

       The three men are jawing, VAPING WEED and taking turns on
       a free WEIGHT BENCH in the yard. If he wasn't fenced in,
       the crazed MASTIFF following and BARKING after The
       Killer's Cruze would probably give chase.

                               THE KILLER (V.O.)
                 Where else can you find so many
                 like-minded individuals? Outside
                 a penitentiary, I mean.

       Luckily, it's only the huge dog paying the car any
       attention as The Killer dr ives by.

       EXT. RENTAL CAR - NEIGHBORHOOD - BRUTE'S HOUSE - MORNING 264D

       The Killer slows, pulls to stop.

       IN THE CAR:

       The Killer rolls down his window, watching in his left
       SIDE MIRROR as he reaches to adjust it with his pinkie.

       IN THE MIRROR: Mastiff retreats, having lost interest,
       the three yoked pals carouse. It's The Brute's turn, and
       he's repeatedly chest-pressing a stacked BARBELL.

       Finishing, The sweaty Brute leaps to his feet, roaring at
       his compatriots, laughing m aniacally. He's a bulked-up,
       tatted-up personification of 'roid rage.

       The Killer turns, leaning out to look back...

       THE KILLER'S MIRROR POV:

       The Brute sucks on a proffered VAPE PEN and expels a
       mushroom cloud. We notice his bare, right leg... where
       he has a beginning-to-heal, jaggedly, perhaps-self-
       STITCHED WOUND on his outer thigh. A stab wound.

      IN THE CAR:

      The Killer faces forward, stares ahead, considering.

                                THE KILLER (V.O.)
                  Hope they're not planning a
                  sleepover.

      He pulls away.   Drives on.

      The Killer wheels a SHOPPING CART to EXPRESS CHECKOUT,
      placing his few ITEMS onto the moving CONVEYOR.

      ANGLE ON:

      FEMALE CASHIER passes each over the SCANNER: a plastic
      KITCHEN FUNNEL... a kitchen DISH TOWEL... a package of

      The Killer's Cruze is parked with a cheap SUNSHADE
      propped in the windshield, but the shade's askew.

      INSIDE THE CRUZE:

      The Killer, in SUNGLASSES, is slumped low, peering...

      THE KILLER'S POV:

      ...past the askew shade, which allows a view of The
      Brute's house, up the block. The cars and motorcycle are
      still parked there.

      Sun's fallen low. The Brute and two Thug Pals come out
      the front door, crossing the yard. Mastiff follows.

      Thug One gets behind the wheel of one car as The Brute
      gets in the passenger side. Thug Two hops on the cycle.
      Mastiff's left, barking after them.



      IN THE CRUZE:

      The Killer pulls down the cardboard shade, starts the
      engine, watches THRU THE WINDSHIELD: as the car and cycle
      head off. He follo ws.

      The Brute and Two Thugs, amped, in their GOLD CHAINS and
      Ed Hardy-esque DUDS, stride three abreast from the busy
      PARKING LOT towards a neon adorned CASINO ENTRANCE.

      Not far away, The Killer's Cruze stops at the end of an
      aisle. The Killer watches the three, then...

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Maybe a mandatory 30-day waiting

      Drives away, leaving them.

      IN THE CRUZE:

      The Killer sits in darkness, about where he was parked
      previously, watching The Brute's house. No activity.

                So, here you are. Vigilant.

                   How's the whole, "I don't give a
                   fuck?" going?

      UP THE STREET:

      HEADLIGHTS swing 'round the corner. It's Thug One's car,
      roaring up to The Brute's and predictably SCREECHING to a
      halt. The Brute climbs from the car.

      After a profanity-laced farewell between Thug and The
      Brute, and an obligatory, tires-smoking U-TURN, the car
      races off. The Brute walks towards his house.

      Mastiff runs across the yard t o greet The Brute,
      following when ignored. The Brute, stumbling, goes in.

      IN THE CRUZE:

      The Killer takes the CAR KEY from the ignition, stashes
      it under the driver's side VISOR.

      He looks at his Fitbit.
      It's "3:12 AM."

      He takes out his GLOCK, checks it.     Pockets it.

      He TAPS his Fitbit.

      "118 bpm."

      He frowns.    He sits back, closes his eyes.

      He breathes in... exhales.    Breathes in.   Out.    In.   Out.

      He check s...
      "116 bpm."

      Disgusted with himself, he pulls the Fitbit off, hangs it
      on the REARVIEW MIRROR. Gets out.

      The bucket-hatted Killer reaches to grab SOMETHING small
      wrapped in PLASTIC, and he also gets the 40oz. BEER
      BOTTLE, wrapped in a PAPER BAG.

      He nudges the door shut, adjusts his hat, starts up the
      block. He glances around, taking his time, on a
      leisurely stroll towards The Brute's.

      barking.

      The Killer   continues, with beer bottle under his arm,
      unwrapping   what he's got in the plastic. He heads along
      the home's   side lot as Mastiff growls and follows on the
      other side   of that fence.

                                 THE KILLER (V.O.)
                   This'll have to be a best guess,
                   based on the average pit bull
                   weighing 45 to 55 pounds. Up
                   close, she actually looks bigger.

      The Killer's close enough to...

                                  THE KILLER (V.O.)
                   Caution: cont ains Diphenhydramine.

      ...casually TOSS what he's unwrapped over.

      IN THE YARD:

      3 sizable MEATBALLS land on the lawn. Mastiff shuts up
      long enough to come sniff. He begins gobbling.

      ON THE STREET:

      The Killer walks on, bending to place the bagged beer
      bottle by the GATE to The Brute's yard, keeps going.

      The Killer crosses to the other side of the street. In
      shadows beneath a tree, The Killer sits down on the curb.

      He puts on GLOVES.

      Mastiff, finished eating, restlessly patrols his turf.

      Adjusting the gloves, The Killer cracks his neck.

      In the yard, Mastiff wanders off.

      Elbows rested on his knees, The Killer watches the house.

      The Brute's house is dark, except FRONT PORCH LIGHT's ON.
      Front and side yard seem empty; no sign of Mastiff.

      ACROSS THE STREET

      The Killer rises from where he's been seated.
      He walks towards The Brute's house.

      He passes the brown-bagged bottle as he opens the fence
      gate and enters the yard. He takes out his gun, stalking
      warily towards the house.

      The Killer approaches the REAR PORCH.
      Walking up the STAIRS, he halts...

      Mastiff lies asleep, SNORING heavily.

      Stepping around, The Killer goes to crouch at the REAR
      DOOR. He peeks in thru the dark WINDOW. He takes out a
      KEY, inserts it in the DEADBOLT.

      It's a BUMP KEY, with a tiny RUBBER WASHER around its
      neck. By applying gentle turning pressure while using
      the butt of his gun to carefully TAP the head of the key,
      he's able to -- TURN the KEY, UNLOCKING the deadbolt.

      The moment of truth: as The Killer quietly enters,
      pocketing the bump key, raising his weapon. He leaves
      the DOOR OPEN behind him as he walks up a dark HALLWAY.

      He checks each room as he proceeds... a LAUNDRY ROOM with
      old WASHER and DRYER to his left... open entryway to
      dark, empty, filthy KITCHEN to his right, with big
      BUTCHER BLOCK ISLAND at center.

      Moving on. He carefully steps around a few em pty BEER
      BOTTLES on the floor. A FLOORBOARD CREAKS underfoot,
      giving The Killer pause. He listens. He proceeds.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Stick to your plan.

      The hall widens to an ENTRY HALL, FRONT DOOR ahead...
      the large LIVING ROOM is thru a broad entryway to the
      right... to the left is a DOOR that's ajar. The whole
      place is like a sparsely furnished frat house.

      The Brute COLLIDES into The Killer like a freight train,

      The Killer's SLAMMED brutally bac kwards against the
      living room threshold and sent SPRAWLING to the hardwood

      His dropped gun bounces into the room.

      The Brute, in SWEATPANTS and MUSCLE SHIRT, strides to the

                              THE BRUTE

      As The Killer's reaching out for his gun, The Brute
      arrives to deliver a GUT KICK.

      The Brute picks up the gun.   The Killer tries to rise.

      The Brute steps to -- KICK The Killer in the ribs.
      The Killer falls onto his back, sucking air.

                              THE BRUTE
                ...they don't cross the street.

      ...one by one to the floor.

      He tosses the empty cartridge over by the gun, advancing.

                              THE BRUTE
                They move to another area code.

The Killer's prone, on his knees, gripping the overladen
COFFEE TABLE in an effort to get up as the Brute SHOVES
the coffee table aside, FLIPPING it -- sends MAGAZINES,
ASHTRAYS and empty BEER BOTTLES flying.

The Killer, on hands and knees, is still trying to rise.
The Brute takes a big step and...

...as he's KICKING -- The Killer drops his shoulder and
twists his upper body; manages to deflect t he kick while
SWEEPING The Brute's other leg out with his arm...

The Brute THUDS hard; flat on his back.

The Killer scrambles atop The Brute, begins PUNCHING him
in the face. The Brute BASHES his fist across the side
of The Killer's head, KNOCKING him off.

Both men get unsteadily to their feet, already breathing
hard from adrenaline excess. They size each other up
while taking a moment to regain th eir footing and senses.
The Brute, wiping at his bloody nose, seems more
bewildered than hurt, and a dim recognition is dawning.

                        THE BRUTE
          Is that... is that you, Mr. Third
          World? Is you, isn't it...?

The Killer's trying to clear his head, inhaling thru
bloodied teeth. We've never seen him angry; we've not
seem him much of anything before, but he's angry now.

The Brute moves in, pugilistic. He and The Killer
circle. The 'roided-up Brute throws sharp, MMA-style
PUNCHES; he's the cinderblock fisted aggressor.

The lighter-on-his-feet Killer evades; backing away,
blocking, waiting for openings as he counter-STRIKES.

The Killer bends to grab up a stainless steel FORK from
beside an aluminum TV DINNER TIN on the floor.
He wields the meager utensil.
The Brute laughs.

The Brute keeps up his flat -footed onslaught, seeking a
knock-out, but The Killer's like a lightning fast cobra
up against a grizzly bear -- deftly STABBING (and
withdrawing) the fork into The Brute's extending, ramrod
arms -- stabbing ONCE... TWICE...

     The grunting Brute wheels, SWINGING.

        ...THRICE: The Brute gets forked in the triceps.

The Brute, holding his arm, regroups, angry.
He charges. The Killer dodges... ducks -- gets HAMMERED
in the back of the neck, but he's already STABBING low...

As The Killer falls...
The Brute CRIES OUT.

The fork is left sticking straight out of The Brute's
right thigh. Agonized, The Brute reaches down to tear
open his sweatpants, revealing that the fork has found
its mark; having been thrust dir ectly and deeply into his
crookedly-stitched, bleeding-anew stab wound.

The Killer rises, dazed but pleased.   Looks around.

The Brute's trembling hand extracts and drops the fork.

The Killer jumps to rip down the cheap, black-out
CURTAINS over one barred WINDOW. He yanks the 5-foot,
metal CURTAIN ROD from curtain loops, disentangling it.

Not a moment too soon, as The Brute's upon him...
The Killer PAR RIES with the blunt rod, JABBING...
avoiding The Brute's graspings. The Brute wants hands-on
combat, his frustration and rage building.

The Killer continuously STRIKES...
The Brute blocks with his meaty hands and forearms.

The Killer leaps onto and over the SOFA, with The Brute
in pursuit, content to spar and retreat.

The Killer switches to SLASHING at and BASHING The
Brute's shins and knees, work ing the lower extremities.
A STAB to the side of The Brute's knee fells him.

As The Brute gets to his feet, a THWACK directly to that
gory thigh wound sends him back down.

The Killer SWINGS the length of the curtain rod across
the small of The Brute's back, then brings the rod over
from behind in a double-handed stranglehold.

The Brute fights to prevent the rod from crushing his
windpipe, jumping up, backpedaling...

He CRUSHES The Killer between himself and the now
FRACTURING, wall-mounted TELEVISION. The Brute bends...

FLIPS The Killer over and off...
It's The Killer's turn to SLAM hardwood.

The Brute's kept ahold of the rod, which he bends against
his raised knee till it SNAPS. He throws the pieces.


                                                 CONTINUED
                                                       88.


The Brute grabs The stunned Killer, lifts him bodily.
Looks like it just might be the grizzly's day after all,
as The Brute THROWS The Killer a fair distance...

The Killer CRASHES into the STEREO SYSTEM, destroying
TURNTABLE, SPEAKERS and VINYL LPs. He collapses to the
floor, nearly-insensate.
He tries to crawl.

The Brute's happy now, gleeful even, coming to stand
literally astride The Killer. H e pushes The Killer with
his foot, turning him over onto his back.

The Brute drops to his knees, places his hands around The
Killer's neck and starts to squeeze.

This startles The Killer fully awake. With the veins in
his neck bulging beneath The Brute's whitening fingers,
The Killer attempts to break the grip. Can't.

The Killer tries desperately to push The Brute off...
tries to grasp the Brute' s own thick neck... tries to
gouge The Brute's protectively-upturned face. The Brute
releases one hand -- PUNCHES The Killer, then...

...reestablishes his vice-like grip on The Killer's
throat. Seems likely this will be over soon.

Except, while his left hand continues its futile
retaliation, The Killer's right hand (still clad, as is
the left, in reddened-by-blood glove), goes to the floor
to begi n frantically reaching around in an effort to find
something -- anything -- to fight back with.

There's nothing within grasp though, except for... a
Budweiser BOTTLE CAP, which The Killer's fingers grab.

The Killer's trying to breath. Failing.

His right hand presses the bottle cap between forefinger
and thumb... squeezing it; managing to slowly BEND it.

Bursting capillaries redden The Killer's wide ey es.

His right hand manages to FOLD the BOTTLE CAP in half, so
its suddenly got two rather pointy ends.

Just then -- as The Killer's verging on unconsciousness,
and The drooling Brute's grinning victoriously -- The
Killer's right hand shoots up...

...SHOVING the sharp bottle cap in The Brute's left ear.

      The Brute recoils as if thrown back by an explosion,
      HOWLING, holding his ear. He scrabbles away.

      The Killer gasps for air, clutching his throat.
      He crawls in the other direction.

      The Brute gets up, falls. Gets up. Clawing at his
      bloody, punctured ear, he looks to where The Killer lies.

                              THE BRUTE
                Fuck this, you fuck! Fuck this.

      He lumbers unevenly out into the hall -- stricken by
      vertigo; his ea rdrum burst -- stumbling to his bedroom.

      On the living room floor, The still hurting Killer looks
      over his shoulder to see The Brute's gone.

      The Killer scrambles to the corner where The Brute
      scattered the disassembled weapon. He finds and takes up
      his gun. He collects the empty cartridge.

      The Killer picks up one of the bullets and tries, with
      shaky hands, to fit it back into the cartridge.

      Acro ss the room, The unsteady Brute returns, with blood
      running down from his ear. He brandishes an AUTOMATIC
      HANDGUN in one hand and sizable REVOLVER in the other.

      The Killer looks up to see this just as...
      He manages to insert the lone bullet into the cartridge.

      Too little too late, The Killer DIVES...

      The Brute rapid-FIRES the auto -- BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
      The Killer disappears behind a section of the SOFA as
      CHUNKS of it are being BLOWN AWAY.

      BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The apoplectic Brute casts aside the
      automatic, stumbles forward, switching the REVOLVER to
      that hand. He attempts to level it...

      The Killer's already on his feet, running...
      The Brute, his aim thrown by imbalance, nonetheless FIRES
      -- BANG! BANG! The Killer LEAPS head-first thru the
      kitchen PASS-THRU.

      BULLETS SPLINTER the pass-thru CABINETS. With SHATTERING
      GLASSES and BOTTLES CRASHING down in his wake, The Killer
      TUMBLES to the linoleum floor.

      The Brute KICKS the kitchen's DOOR OPEN, aiming, his
      stagger-inducing vertigo be damned...

      The Killer takes cover behind the kitchen island as --
      BANG! -- SPLITTING BUTCHER BLOCK absorbs a THUDDING SLUG.

      The cowering Killer manages to SHOVE the cartridge into
      his gun. He primes the weapon.

      The Brute's coming around, seeking a clear shot.
      The Killer springs, momentarily out in the open...

      The Brute's got him dead to rights, except...
      The Killer throws the hulking, old-school REFRIGERATOR's
      DOOR open between himself and the next BANG! BANG! BANG!

      The Killer springs up, aiming from behind the fridge door
      -- FIRING his one and only shot.

      A RED HOLE APPEARS in The Brute's forehead.
      His eyes roll to white. He collapses.

      The wrecked, empty room is quiet. Sofa's SMOLDERING.
      The Killer enters from the kitchen, enervated. He looks
      around a moment, seems uncertain. He crosses.

      He picks up his bucket hat.

      The Killer returns, stepping over The Brute's body.
      He goes to the refrigerator, opens the upper FREEZER
      door, looks in. He takes out a BAG of FROZEN CORN. He
      presses the bag to his face.

      The Killer starts towards the back door.    A low O.S.
      GROWLING is HEARD.

      The Killer stops in his tracks, dropping the bag of corn.

      Thru the back door, Mastiff comes to stand in view on the
      porch, fully awake, SNARLING.

      The Killer runs up the hall.
      Mastiff bolts after him.

      Mastiff's fast, closing the gap...
      Snapping at The Killer's heels.
                                                               91.

       The Killer ducks into The Brute's bedroom, SLAMMING the
       DOOR behind; just barely shutting Mastiff out.
       The beast can be HEARD CLAWING, barking.

       FOLLOW: as The Killer keeps moving, heading...
       Thru the BATHROOM, towards the back of the house...
       Thru into that LAUNDRY ROOM, where...

       He's certainly free and clear now, but as he glances over
       his shoulder to where Mastiff's still raging at the
       bedroom door...

       The Killer's foot SLIPS on the bag of frozen corn.

       He FLOPS hard to the floor.

       Mastiff immediately takes off towards him.

       The Killer scrambles... trying to regain his footing.
       The gnashing, hard charging Mastiff nearly upon him.

       The Killer makes it out, pulling the DOOR SHUT in
       Mastiff's face. Another close call. Mastiff's BARKING
       furiously. The beaten and bloody Killer falls.

       He tries to rise, but staggers. He goes unsteadily to
       his knees. He finds he must sit there a moment, his head
       held in his hands, breathing; trying to regain himself.

       He lifts his head, gets to his feet.
       He walks, shakily, down the porch stairs.

      The Killer disbelieving... picks up the pace.

      He pushes thru the gate and closes it, going to his knees
      just as Mastiff arrives, thwarted, frothing.

      The Killer picks himself up again.
      He takes up and unwraps the waiting beer bottle, which is
      now filled with GASOLINE, one must presume, since it's
      sporting a DISH TOWEL fuse.

      Mastiff barks and rages beyond the chainlink, watching as
      The Killer takes out a LIGHTER to LIGHT the fuse.

      Mastiff's BARKING and distant SIRENS are HEARD. A WINDOW

      The Killer walks away. Behind, Mastiff gives voice to

                Alright. It's common knowledge,
                when a female is found slain, the
                prime suspect is always the
                husband or boyfriend. Especially

At another, TWO COUPLES chat amicably over COFFEE.

The Expert looks down to get her CLUTCH. She's about to
open it when... a HAND gently takes it from her grasp.

It's The Killer, arriving to take a seat, much to her
astonishment.

                        THE EXPERT
          Pardon me, what do you think
          you're -- ?

The Killer slides towards her while he's...

...showing her his GUN, out of view of others.

The Expert's eyes flick to see this.

The Expert fixes her gaze, the embers of anger dimming to
shocked realization; as if by not looking at him she may
somehow deny what's occurring.

The Killer keeps his eyes on her while his right hand
places a NAPKIN over the gun between them.

The Expert lets herself now take in The Killer's
features, everything perfectly, chillingly clear to her.

The Killer reaches across to take The Expert's WATER
GLASS and sip from it, surveying the room to make sure no
one's paying undue attention.

He puts the glass down, opens The Expert's purse.
The Expert watches, clenching her jaw, but... she's at
his mercy. The Killer takes a SLEEK PISTOL from the
purse, pockets it. He slides the purse back to her.

The Expert swallows, blinks. She shakes her head to
herself, giving a hollow laugh.

                        THE EXPER T
          I'd been so good for so long.
          Suddenly, my deepest regret is not
          having Haagen-Dazs with every
          meal.

She glances to the KITCHEN DOOR -- in the direction The
Killer came from -- as STAFF pass thru it.

A HANDSOME WAITER comes to the table.

She's at a loss. Handsome Waiter just waits amicably.

               (to The Killer)
          You won't mind if I have a drink?

                        THE EXPERT
               (to Handsome Waiter)
          No menu, Carl. A flight of
          whiskeys, though. And... my
          bottle, while you're at it.

                         HANDSOME WAITER

          By a "drink," of course I mean
          "many."

She looks around, still in woeful shock.

                        THE EXPERT
          Here's where I'm supposed to ask
          how you found me, but... does it
          matter?

She looks to The Killer, studying him; searching his
reactions, or lack thereof.

                        THE EXPERT
          Tell me Hodges is dead, at least.
          Give me that? Tell me he went
          painfully.
               (of the FOOD)
          Help yourself, by the way. The
          chef sends out anything he
          imagines I'd like.
          Though, I doubt I'll manage much
          more of an appetite.

She moves a PLATE of beautifully prepared STEAK TARTARE

pleasing DISHES she's barely touched.

She picks up one of her FORKS, slides her arm across the
table and holds the fork out to The Killer.

                        THE EXPERT
          Afraid it's tainted?

The Expert waggles the still proffered fork.

Relenting, The Killer picks up his own FORK.
He dutifully samples, chews.

The Expert sits back, observing him.

                        THE EXPERT

She looks out the PARTONS in the restaurant.

          Can't pretend anymore, either. We
          share that too. Once you've been

She CLINKS the 2nd glass against the empty, then throws
back the 2nd. She puts 2nd glass back on the plank.

The Killer glances to her, looks away.   She noticed.

          Money was motivation. Which, once
          there was enough, could be used to

          someone in your sights was so
          thoroughly despised?

                        THE KILLER
          Less you know the better.

The Killer does hear her in there.

                         THE EXPERT
          One man's cruelty is another man's
          pragmatism; blah, blah, blah.
                (pause, clears
                 her throat)
          A hu nter goes into the woods...
          and spies an enormous grizzly --
          biggest he's ever seen.

The Killer looks, raising an eyebrow.    She just goes on.

                        THE EXPERT
          The hunter raises his rifle and
          fires. The bear falls. The
          hunter gives chase, but to his
          surprise, he finds no blood, no
          broken twigs. The bear's nowhere
          to be found. Suddenly... from
          behind, the grizzly throws a
          massive arm around the hunter an d
          explains: "You took your shot.
          You missed. So, now I either
          feast, or... I sodomize you.

                        THE EXPERT (CONT.)
          The choice is yours." Naturally
          the hunter chooses life. Next
          day, the hunter returns to the
          woods. He's brought a much more
          powerful rifle. The hunter sees
          this bear in the distance. Aims,
          fires, and charges headlong to
          where the grizzly was felled...
          only, again, he finds: no bear.
          The hunter's in disbelief, when
          the grizzly appears beside him
          saying: "You know the deal."
          Indignity ensues. The following
          day, the hunter treks back into
          the forest, armed with a bazooka.
          He spots the grizzly, lines him in
          his crosshairs and fires. The
          recoil of the bazooka knocks the
          hunter backwards. When the smoke
          clears and the hunter's regained
          his senses, he finds the grizzly
          standing over him, his arms
          crossed. And the bear squints:
          "You're not really out here for
          the hunting, are you?"

The Killer can't help something resembling a smile.
The Expert, pleased, picks up the 3rd shot.

The Killer watches her drink. She tilts her head back;
letting herself feel the effects.

                        THE EXPERT
          You could have made this hit-and-
          run; a car-jacking gone wrong.
          Could have been I slipped on the
          ice, easily. Instead... here you
          are. If I were to scream, well...
          I'd still end up dead. And you'd
          make it out, most likely. But not
          clean, you wouldn't.

She's watching for him to...

                         THE EXPERT
          So, why...?   Why did you take such
          a risk?

                          THE KILLER
          Conversation?

                        THE EXPERT
          I'm flattered, but... no.    No,
          you're here because...

...for him to... take the bait.

                        THE EXPERT
          ...you couldn't help yourself.

The Killer looks to her.    She meets his gaze.

The Killer's unblinking eyes watch her.

She smiles smugly at him.

                        THE EXPERT
          You expected you'd sit looking at
          me tonight and be nothing but
          reassured.
               (pause)
          Like you were so certain, one
          recent day...? When you
          shouldered your weapon...
               (pause)
          ...and somehow... missed.

The Killer se ems, at long last, disquieted.

She reaches to place the two stacked shot glasses side by
side. She opens the bottle... pours into both glasses.

                        THE EXPERT
          One doesn't choose our line of
          work without giving "the end" due
          consideration.
               (pause)
          So, how's it possible, having
          prepared myself for this moment...
          I somehow fooled myself into
          believing it would never arrive?

She's shaking her head sadly at thi s.
She reaches to place one glass in front of The Killer.

                        THE EXPERT
          Allow me to share an intuition.
          Since, sooner or later, it'll be
          you sitting where I am now.

The Expert drops an ICE CUBE in the other glass, in front
of her, and it overflows a bit.

                        THE EXPERT
          My advice to you: believe it.

With that, The Expert, allows herself to lift the last
shot. She drinks. She places the shot glass upside down
on the table just as Handsome Waiter returns.

                Excellent.

      He starts collecting entrï¿½e dishes.

      The Killer takes the shot in front of him and drinks --
      throwing it back.

                              THE EXPERT
                They don't happen to have any ice

                No.   No... that's alright.

      A BUSBOY and RUNNER arrive to assist Handsome Waiter,
      clearing plates from the miserable couple before them.

      From a FIXED VANTAGE POINT: we look back across the
      bridge as The Expert and The Killer head this direction
      from the restaurant. The Killer walks just behind her,
      keeping his hand in his pocket, close but not too close.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Stick to the plan. Anticipate;
                don't improvise. Trust no --

                              THE EXPERT

                      (glancin g back)

      few paces ahead still, keeping an eye on her.


                              THE EXPERT
                Last minutes... spent aware that
                they're actually last minutes...
                I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

      As they reach the gap between fencing and bridge rail,
      The Expert abruptly stops and wheels. The Killer halts.

                              THE EXPERT
                Who -- come to think of it -- at
                this moment, is you.

      The Killer points to the gap, which The Expert regards.

      The Expert has no recourse. TOSSING the leftovers over
      her shoulder, she heads into the gap, down an embankment
      towards the SOUND OF RUSHING WATER. The Killer glances
      quickly around, follows her.

      EXT. CREEKBED - NIGHT

      Walking a narrow DIRT PATH to the lower CREEKBANK, The
      Expert looks back at The Killer, who nods her onward.

      The Killer is keeping The Expert a few paces ahead of
      him. She moves slowly along the edge of the CREEK. From
      the dark, she looks up and across to...

      ...the warm GLOW from the restaurant LIGHTS above them.
      She raises her voice back over her shoulder to him.

                              THE EXPERT
                You'll remember our co nversation.
                You will.

      She trips up a bit on the rocky, uneven footing.

      The Killer still has his hand in his pocket.

                               THE EXPERT
                When your time does arrive... it
                won't be your life flashing before
                your eyes -- it'll be mine.
                      (laughs)
                I suppose it'll be the closest I
                can hope to come to haunting you.

      The Expert gives a CRY as she TRIPS, falling forward to
      her hands and knees. The Killer stops.

      With an exasperated exhalation, The Expert straightens,
      kneeled, and thrusts her right arm back without looking.

                              THE EXPERT
                Help a girl up, won't you?

      Her right hand is extended, reaching...
      The Expert turns to look as The Killer moves forward.

      Instead of offering his hand, The Killer's pulling his
      gun and --POOF -- SHOOTS The Expert in the temple,
      sending her down in bent heap; instantly dead.

      The Kill er steps up, ROLLS The Expert's corpse over on
      the pebbled creek bank...

                                THE KILLER (V.O.)
                Trust no one.

      ...to see that The Expert held a deadly-looking, open
      SWITCHBLADE, in her left hand.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                This is what it takes... if you
                want to succeed.

      The Killer takes out his HANDKERCHIEF, uses it take and
      examine the switchblade. He closes the switchblade, then
      TOSSES it away. The Killer looks down, noticing...

      The Expert's blouse has lost a button and pulled open,
      exposing her lacy BRA.

      The Killer kneels, reaches to...
      Close The Expert's blouse.

      The Killer rises, looking upon The Expert's body for a
      moment. Then, he walks, back the way they came.

       The Killer arrives curbside to watch - the idling sedan
       waits, but not long - as the revolving door spits out a

       He's wearing a TRACK SUIT and carrying a "BALI-QUINOX"

       Claybourne is in the car before the apologetic DRIVER is

       The Killer arrives. He spots the "BALI-QUINOX" logo...

       ...where a few GYM FOLKS come and go from the COMPLEX.

       The Killer sees...

       POV:

       The Mercedes sedan is parked in a yellow LOADING ZONE.
       DRIVER inside. Its BLINKERS BLINK. Its EXHAUST puffs.

       ON THE STREET

       Reassured, The Killer walks on...

       The Killer takes in the upscale scene. Mostly young and
       somewhat healthy MEN and WOMEN crisscross in WORK-OUT
       GEAR. A JANITOR, as-nattily-clad-as-you-can-get-in-
       COVERALLS, moves past, pushing a modest CART.

       The Killer goes to GUEST RECEPTION, where lovely and
       handsome GREETERS assist MEMBERS. There's a COUNTER with
       TOUCH SCREENS awaiting. The Killer uses the conductive
       RUBBER TIP of his NO-TO UCH-TOOL on one SCREEN...

      AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, THE SALESMAN'S SUV is parked
      nearby in this trash strewn, no man's land.

      THE SALESMAN uses KEYS at the SUV lift-gate.

                              THE SALESMAN
                Sticks sometimes. You gotta...
                jiggle it.

      The Killer watches. The Salesman steps back, raising the
      lift-gate to reveal an AMERICAN FLAG spread out across
      the SUV's rear interior.

                              THE SALESMAN
                Our democracy at work.

      He throws the flag back: unveil ing various GUNS laid out.
      Mostly HANDGUNS, but also a couple of RIFLES.

                              THE SALESMAN
                Browning. Smith & Wesson. Colt.
                If you don't see what you want, I
                can get it.

      The Killer steps up to study the selection.
      His eyes survey the various REVOLVERS and AUTOMATICS.

                              THE SALESMAN
                What's your pleasure? A twenty-
                two? Which, you know, won't do
                much more than make the other
                guy's ears ring. Maybe a gut -

                relatively portable to drop an
                elk. She's a beauty.

      The Killer takes up a GLOCK, pops the CLIP, flicks the
      STOP, pulls back the SLIDE; confirms it's empty.
      He blows into it, examines.

                              THE SALESMAN
                Man knows his way around the Glock
                sub-compacts.

      He reconfigures the gun, replaces it. Picks up another
      GLOCK, feels its weight. The Salesman watches, takes off
      his hat and scratches his rubber-banded man bun.

      He takes a SILENCER from his pocket, which makes The
      Salesman's eyebrows rise.

                              THE SALESMAN
                And brings his own patato.    Niice.

      He screws it onto the barrel of the small auto.
      The Salesman pulls his beanie back on.

                              THE SALESMAN
                     (gesturing to GU NS)
                Listen, Slim, here's what I can
                do. Because I like you. Buy one,
                and the second gun -- same price
                or less -- is half-off.

      He turns and extends his arm to hold up the silencer-
      adorned Glock, aiming into surrounding darkness --
      looking down the gun's sights.

                              THE KILLER
                This is plenty.

      Barely light out. The Killer strides towards a WALL of
      YELLOW LOCKERS, with their familiar AMAZON SIGNAGE.
      He uses his No-Touch-Tool to PUNCH in a CODE.

      He crouches at LOCKER "13," opens it.
      Takes out a small AMAZON BOX.

      The Killer rips the box open... examines what he ordered:
      a handheld RFID CARD DUPLICATOR, looking like some sort
      of cheap, weird stud-finder, packaged along with a few
      blank KEY FOBS and RFID CARDS.

       The Killer, still in street clothes and carrying his

       Amongst the rows of seemingly endless TREADMILLS and
       STATIONARY BIKES, the Janitor's crossing.

       The Killer tracks him.

       Janitor's stopping to collect crumpled PAPER CUPS around
       a WATER COOLER. He says hello to some MEMBERS, but seems
       pretty checked-out.

       What's of particular interest to The Killer...

       ...is the zip-line clipped ORANGE KEYCARD on Janitor's
       belt, beside the laden KEYCHAIN hooked to it.

       The Killer follows, then crosses to a far SINK.

       Pretending to wash his hands, The Killer watches in the
       MIRROR as Janitor begins CLEANING at a middle SINK.

       The Killer wipes his hands on a TOWEL, tosses it, makes
       his move... heading back and approaching the Janitor from

                 Oh -- sorry...

       Janitor glances over his shoulder as the zip-cord zips
       back in place, now empty. The Killer backs away, holds
       his jacket up with an a pologetic smile, keeps going.

                                JANITOR
                 No problem.   Yeah.

       Janitor goes about his business, unaware.

       TRAINER as Claybourne sheds his TRACK SUIT, in GYM
       CLOTHES and SNEAKERS underneath. Claybourne's Trainer
       folds the suit, places it in the locker.

       Trainer hands over a WATER BOTTLE from the gym bag, puts
       the bag in the locker. Claybourne's already heading
       out... passing behind The Killer, who looks as...

       The Killer faces forward.   Gathers himself.   Stands.

       Working at a side-table in the lounge, The Killer takes

       and inserts Claybourne's KEYCARD into a slot.
       He presses "READ." "BUSY" glows YELLOW.

       Claybourne's keycard and keychain. He shoves the blank
       KEYCARD in the duplicator's slot.
       Hits the "WRITE" BUTTON.

       He awaits the result.   S eems to take forever.

       The duplicator's "PASS" light goes GREEN.

                  Who needs a Trojan Horse when
                  you've got Postmates? 'Cause
                  everything's air-tight, till the
                  billionaire wants Thai delivered.

      The Killer retraces his earlier route, up the ramp.

      ANGLE ON:

      He steps into CLOSE-UP, pressing a KEYCARD against the
      SECURITY DOOR's grey plastic reader -- BOOP.

      The Killer steps inside, holds his KEYCARD to the READER
      on the elevator PANEL. A quiet DING acknowledges.

      The Killer's NO-TOUCH-TOOL hits "PH."   BUTTON LIGHTS UP.

                                THE KILLER (V.O.)
                  Once I see his eyes, I'll have a
                  pretty good idea how this is gonna
                  go.

                                                         CUT TO:

      Entering from a long HALLWAY, The Killer walks to stand,
      silenced GUN held outstretched...

      ...a vast, multi-storied PENTHOUSE before him. Enormous
      WINDOWS look to a glittering CITYSCAPE. At the center of
      it all, is an unmanned, MAGAZINE and NEWSPAPER littered
      STANDING DESK with several KEYBOARDS before an array of
      FLAT SCREENS crazily alive with colorful day-trader
      MARKET INFO and NATIONAL NEWS.

      T he Killer walks calmly through this space, attentive.

      Across the room, Claybourne comes padding in through a
      gleaming KITCHENETTE. He's wearing a big KNIT CARDIGAN
      and RETRO CONCERT TEE. He speaks into a BLUETOOTH
      EARPIECE, carries an open CARTON of SOY MILK.

                         CLAYBOURNE
                (into BLUETOOTH HEADSET)
          There must be some applicable tax
          burden offset, and I simply expect
          to see heaven and earth moving...
                (brief pause)
          ...hey...hey, if it doesn't work
          out, believe me, I'm not going to
          be disappointed in you, I'll be
          disappointed in me, and everyone
          involved for not having replaced
          you sooner.

Claybourne halts, startled to as he sees The Killer.
He does a bewildered double take.

                       CLAYBOURNE
               (to The Killer)
          Who the fuck? How did you...?

The Killer doesn't brandish his gun, just aims it at him.

                        CLAYBOURNE
          Okay.  I...I...
               (into EARPIECE)
          I'll call you back,
          Marvin... umm...gotta call back,
          Mar... I am fucking hanging up.

Claybourne presses his earpiece's BUTTON to hang up.

                        CLAYBOURNE
               (gesturing to GUN)
          Didn't notice the.. ah, at first.
          I'm all ears.
               (points at his EARPIECE )
          I'm--you see; so you don't...

With forefinger and thumb, he makes a show of slowly
reaching to take the EARPIECE out. He throws it away,
holds his hands up, awkwardly.

                        CLAYBOURNE
          Security building, eh? Christmas
          Bonus'll be light this year.
          I... uh... I...
               (glancing around)
          Don't keep cash here. But I can
          have some delivered. Depending on
          what amount we're talking about,
          what kind of currency you'r e--

The Killer's shaking his head.



                                                CONTINUED
                                                   119.


                        CLAYBOURNE
          No? Okay. Well... then, what is
          it exactly I can do for you?

The Killer nods towards a SEATING AREA.
Claybourne sits on the L-shaped COUCH.

                        CLAYBOURNE
          Whatever you need... I'm confident
          we can work it out; we put our
          heads together.

The Killer stands across from him. He motions with his
weapon for Claybourne to lower his hands.

                        THE KILLER
          I came to show you how easily one
          might get to you, Mr.
          Claybourne... and to ask...
                (pointedly)
          ...do you and I have a problem?

                         CLAYBOURNE
          Do... we... what? A problem? Of
          course not. No. You and I... we
          have no problem whatsoever. Not
          in the slightest.
                (pause, admitting doubt)
          Am I... supposed to know who you
          are. Because, I apologize -- and
          my memory for names and faces
          isn't what it used to be -- but
          I... don't believe we've met.

The Killer ta kes out his PHONE with his free hand,
unlocks it, thumb-types. Then he steps forward, holds up
his phone. Claybourne squints at the GOOGLE MAPS IMAGE.

                        CLAYBOURNE
               (of the MAP on the PHONE)
          Alright. It's...there's an
          address. "3 Rue du Grev" -- I...
          I'm still not...

Then Claybourne realizes.

                          CLAYBOURNE
          Oh.    Oh, wait... that...
                 (looks from the PHONE to
                  the Killer's face)
          You.

Uh oh.

                                                       120.


                        CLAYBOURNE
          I didn't realize, but I'm up to
          speed. Please, hear me out. To
          answer your question, we have no
          problem. I harbor no ill will
          about anything that may have
          happened. Or NOT happened. Hah.
          Let me make that crystal clear.
          Right after the, uh, incident, I
          received a phone call. I was told
          that things had... gone south. My
          response was, actually, "Well,
          nobody's perfect." Now on that
          same call, I did, I admit, inquire
          as to what is normally done in
          these circumstances and they, he,
          the lawyer fella, Hedges suggested
          that in This Very Rare Case, I
          might wish to arrange for
          insurance, to prevent any
          "blowback."

The Killer takes this in.

                        CLAYBOURNE
          I remember thinking, "Why in the
          world is this liability mine?" I
          mean, you have to please
          understand, this entire enter.. I
          was very new to this kind of
          thing, this was an investment that
          didn't pay out, I bled a little
          ink, so yeah, selfishly, I didn't
          want any..."blowback", so
          eventually we agreed that for an
          additional hundred and fifty K,
          the, uh, trail, could be
          "scrubbed." That was literally
          all I was told; "clean up on aisle
          three", HIS words, not MINE, and
          so I double-checked to make sure
          there was enough in escr ow, and I
          never thought about it again,
          until...
                (indicates this moment)
          What I'm trying to say here and I
          can't express this strongly
          enough: I have NO issue with you.
          Zero. Far as I'm concerned: We.
          Are. Good.

The Killer ponders, gun still leveled at Claybourne.




                                                CONTINUED
                                                           121.


                               THE KILLER
                 I'm curious... how is it that I
                 walked into your home in the
                 middle of the night with a
                 silenced pistol... and you had no
                 idea why I might be here?

       Claybourne considers for a beat. With the merest shake
       of his head, he looks to The Killer, raises his hands
       palms up, giving a slow, sheepish, at-a-loss SHRUG.

       The Killer lowers the gun. He turns and crosses back the
       way he came, pocketing the weapon. Claybourne, remaining
       seated, is watching him go.

       The Killer stops.   He remains facing away.

       Claybourne's eyes are anxiously on The Killer.

                               THE KILLER
                 If there is a next time...

       The Killer turns back, looking to Claybourne.

                               THE KILLER
                 ...it may be a radioactive speck
                 on the lip of your favorite mug --
                 a slow death, mind you; from
                 painful, facial necrosis... or a
                 misstep into an empty express
                 elevator shaft... or an electrical
                 fire while asleep, but...
                       (pause)
                 ...I do promise, I'll come up with
                 something appropriate.

       With that, The Killer is gone.

                                                          CUT TO:

       THE KILLER'S HAND takes from his pocket the THREE ROLODEX
       CARDS, holds them before him... TEARS the CARDS in HALF.

       The Killer exits from the PARKING RAMP, shuts it. We
       watch him walking away. Far up the street, a hulking,
       noisy STREET CLEANER lumbers slowly along in the opposite
       direction, its circular, spinning WIRE BRUSHES kicking
       dust and a fine mist of water in the vehicle's wake. As
       he goes, The Killer takes his PHONE from his pocket.

      Just as the street cleaner's getting closer, he casually
      CHUCKS his phone (and Rolodex cards) into the street; in
      the vehicle's path. The street cleaner gobbles the phone
      up. The Killer keeps walking.

                                                           CUT TO:

      INT. KILLER'S ESTATE HOUSE, KITCHEN -CLOSE-UPS - LATE DAY 345
345

      IN DELICATE CLOSE-UPS:

      -The Killer uses a PARING KNIFE to artfully cut a long,
      thin, curling SLIVER of LEMON PEEL from a LEMON.

      -He slides forward the handle of a COFFEE GRINDER,
      releasing finely ground COFFEE into a PORTAFILTER.

      -He takes up a gleaming, SILVER TAMPER, which he uses to
      firmly tamp the COFFEE flat in the PORTAFILTER.

      -He fits the PORTAFILTER to the ESPRESSO MACHINE's GROUP
      HEAD and twists to secure it in place.

      -A narrow, steady STREAM of CARAMEL COLORED COFFEE pours
      down from the mouth of the PORTAFILTER, filling a SMALL,
      flawless white ESPRESSO CUP on the DRIP TRAY.

      -The Killer places the CUP on its SAUCER, then balances
      the LEMON PEEL SLIVER on the cup's lip so it rests
      partially on the coffee's surface.

      INT. ESTATE HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATE DAY

      The Killer places this perfect ESPRESSO ROMANO on a
      SERVING TRAY, beside a folded CLOTH NAPKIN and several
      small COOKIES on a WHITE DISH. He lifts the tray.

                              THE KILLER (V.O.)
                The need to feel... secure. It's
                a slippery slope.

      The Killer (in SHORTS, short-sleeved-BUTTON DOWN and
      SUNGLASSES) crosses the lovely, spotless KITCHEN.

      INT. ESTATE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- LATE DAY

      The Killer carries the tray thru. This room, like the
      rest of the breathtaking home, is entirely restored.

      The Killer crosses from the house...
      Heading for a grouping of LOUNGE FURNITURE which faces
      the BEACH, not far beyond, and stunning SKIES.

                        THE KILLER (V.O.)
          Fate... is a placebo. The only
          life path... the one behind you.

AT THE LOUNGE AREA

Magdala, in a CHAISE, looks up as The Killer places the
serving tray on a TABLE. She's in LOUNGE WEAR, a LONG
ROBE, and still some BANDAGES. As she smiles at The
Killer -- accepting the espresso he offers -- the large
SUNGLASSES she wears can't hide the swollen and
discolored, albeit healing, co ndition of her face.

The Killer sits in the ocean-facing CHAIR beside
Magdala's. He observes as Magdala, watching waves
advance and retreat, sips the dainty coffee.

The Killer sits back, faces front; takes in the view.

                        THE KILLER (V.O.)
          If, in the brief time we're all
          given, you can't accept this...
          well, maybe you're not one of the
          few.

He keeps peering seaward, wearing his usual expression of
em pty resolve. The sun glints off his sunglasses.

He takes off his sunglasses, keeps staring forward.

It's very hard not to notice, as he's staring for the
longest moment, that he does not blink -- not once.

                        THE KILLER (V.O.)
          Maybe you're just like me...

Until, finally, with sunny skies reflected in those
steadfast, impossibly-UNBLINKING EYES, The Killer's RIGHT
EYE trembles, TWITCHING sharply.

                        THE KILLER (V.O.)
          ...one of the many.

Here we leave The Killer and Magdala, peacefully
together, facing a vision of a seemingly perfect world; a
flawless line of wide, sandy beach, beyond which the
slightly curvin g horizon line of sun-dappled water meets
azure skies of blindingly white clouds.

                                                    THE END
