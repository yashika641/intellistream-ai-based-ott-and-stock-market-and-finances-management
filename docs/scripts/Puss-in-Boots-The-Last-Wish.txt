         EXT. A STARSCAPE

         A scene of surpassing beauty: ethereal light, vibrant cosmic
         clouds, jewel-like constellations. Celestial gases swirl--
         then FLARE as A NEW STAR blazes to life.

                             PUSS (V.O.)
                   Star light, star bright, first star
                   I see tonight-- I wish I may, I
                   wish I might, have this wish I wish
                   tonight.

                            This story is a Fairy Tale.
         Title on screen:

         The star begins to fall from the heavens, shedding enchanted
         light.

                             PUSS (V.O.)
                   Once upon a time, a wishing star
                   fell from the sky--

         The star plummets to Earth. It impacts within an OLD GROWTH
         FOREST, sending out a burning pulse of cosmic power.

                             PUSS (V.O.)
                   Scorching a great woods black.

         Glittering stardust rains onto the ashy earth.

         TIME LAPSE: a tiny plant sprouts, vivid green against the
         blackened landscape. Saplings grow and stretch for the sky.
         Colorful flowers bloom, fed by stardust, drawing enchantment
         from the soil.

                             PUSS (V.O.)
                   The Dark Forest was born. The
                   wishing star hidden at its center
                   filling it with new life and the
                   legend of a single wish, locked
                   away in the star... waiting to be
                   granted.

                            PUSS IN BOOTS ~ The Last Wish
         Title on screen:


         INT. CLIFFSIDE MANSION - DARK HALLWAY - NIGHT

         FAMILIAR BOOTS step from the shadows: stylish size ones,
         beautifully cobbled.

         PUSS IN BOOTS walks down a dark hallway. He approaches a
         curtain and pauses like an actor about to take the stage.
         Beyond the curtain, an excited crowd chants his name.



                             CROWD (O.S.)
                   Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

         Puss limbers up, takes a deep breath and steps through the
         curtain. It's showtime...


         INT. CLIFFSIDE MANSION - BANQUET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

         Puss enters to CHEERS.

                             PUSS
                   Welcome to my fiesta!

         There's a party underway and it looks like a raucous one.
         HAPPY PEASANTS crowd the room. Someone is carting in a
         wheelbarrow of fireworks. Someone else, rolling in a barrel
         of leche.

         A HOUSE BAND plays upbeat music as Puss threads his way
         through the adoring crowd.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Make yourselves at home! Yeah!

         Puss skewers a magnificent spread of food, making a sword-
         kabob.

                             PUSS   (CONT'D)
                   Come on, eat!

         Puss leaps, uncorking three stacked barrels with one swipe of
         his sword. Leche pours forth and people fill their goblets.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Drink up! Ha, ha!

         As Puss walks through the crowd, people extend their hands to
         lift him up.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Hey! Hola, amigo. Good to see you
                   again!

         A woman FAINTS, overcome with emotion.

                             FEMALE PARTY GOER
                   OHH!

         Puss is lifted skyward, walking on the upraised hands of the
         crowd. He inadvertently steps on a LITTLE BOY's face, leaving
         a boot-print.



                             LITTLE BOY
                   Papa! He stepped on my face!

                             PROUD PAPA
                   And we will never wash it again!

         The crowd goes WILD as Puss poses on a high balcony,
         overlooking the audience. Someone hits him with a spotlight.

                             PUSS
                   Good people of Cordova--

                             PARTY GOER #1 (O.S)
                   It's Del Mar.

                             PUSS
                   People of Del Mar, accept these
                   golden gifts from Puss in Boots!

         Puss tips over a wooden chest and gold coins rain down on the
         audience below. Applause!

                             PARTY GOER #2
                       (shouting up)
                   Play a song!

                             PUSS
                   No, no, no, I couldn't.

                              LITTLE BOY
                   Sing, Puss! Sing!

                             PUSS
                       (feigning modesty)
                   I couldn't possibly--

         A guitar flies in from off screen. Puss catches it without
         looking.

         Puss launches into an elaborate flamenco solo, stomping his
         heels in time to the beat.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?

         SONG MONTAGE: The cuts are fast, the action is crazy, the
         crowd is loose.

         Giant BALLS OF YARN are launched into the audience. The crowd
         bounces them around like BEACHBALLS!



                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Who is brave and ready for trouble?

                             CROWD
                       (singing)
                   You are! You are!

                             PUSS
                       (singing)
                   Hah hah! Who is unbelievably
                   humble?

                             CROWD
                       (singing)
                   You are! You are!
         Puss stage dives from the balcony and crowd surfs. He lands
         elegantly on a bar top, spins and kicks glasses of leche to
         the crowd. One happy party goer is clobbered by a glass.

                             PUSS
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?

         A MAN'S HAND is splayed on a table while a blade stabs "Pin-
         Finger" around it. Reveal: Puss is using his sword like a
         pogo-stick, bouncing around the guy's fingers.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Who's the gato who rolls the dice?

                              PARTY GOERS
                   You are!

                             PUSS
                   And gambles with his life?

                              PARTY GOERS
                   You are!

         Now PUSS is splayed out on a SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL.
         PARTYGOERS play "PIN-FINGER", stabbing a knife between his
         limbs.

                             PUSS
                       (singing)
                   Who's never been touched by a
                   blade?

                              PARTY GOERS
                   You are!



                             PUSS
                   Puss in Boots is never afraid!

         VERY CLOSE ON: Puss' boots, dancing artfully in time to the
         music. WIDER: The boots are actually worn by a high-stepping
         ANDALUSIAN HORSE. Puss is riding on the horse's back, sipping
         leche.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?

         TWO PRETTY CATS tip over candlesticks and create a curtain of
         dazzling fire. Puss dances through it, tangoing across the
         tabletop with a besotted CHICKEN.
         The song reaches a fevered climax as Puss rips into another
         flamenco solo, swinging on a VELVET CURTAIN, poised over the
         crowd.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless--

         The mansion doors BANG OPEN, interrupting. A man enters,
         bearing luggage. He's flanked by armed guards.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (trailing off)
                   --hero?

         The GOVERNOR, a pompous bureaucrat in a powdered wig, has
         returned from vacation. This is HIS mansion. He sputters,
         looking around in disbelief.

                             GOVERNOR
                   My clothes!

         Peasants have raided the Governor's wardrobe and are parading
         around in his finest threads.
                                GOVERNOR (CONT'D)
                       (gasp)
                   My wig!

         They've raided his wig closet as well. A bewigged PLOW-HORSE
         stares at him and NICKERS.

                              GOVERNOR (CONT'D)
                       (gasp)
                   My portrait!



         The face of the Governor's immense portrait has been painted
         over with a likeness of Puss in Boots. The Governor spots
         Puss himself, hanging above it.

                             PUSS
                   Oh, hey, Governor. Uh...One second.

         Puss uses his claws, slo-owly sliding down (and shredding)
         the Governor's portrait.

                             GOVERNOR
                   The outlaw Puss in Boots!

         Puss lands and smiles sheepishly.

         GRAPHIC INSERT: The iconic Puss in Boots BOUNTY POSTER
         smashes into frame (Wanted: Dead or Alive).

                             PUSS
                   Welcome! Mi casa es su casa!

                             GOVERNOR
                   No, su casa es MI casa!
                   Arrest these filthy peasants-- and
                   bring me the head of Puss in Boots!

         The guards run at Puss. He draws his sword and turns to the
         band.

                             PUSS
                   Hey! This is a party! Where is the
                   music?

         The BAND PLAYS AND SINGS over action:

                             BAND
                       (singing)
                   He's the blade of justice. Stands
                   up against evil. Fighting for the
                   people. And he's very good looking.
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?

         Puss dispatches the guards with jaw-dropping skill, his moves
         worthy of a dancing master.

                             BAND (CONT'D)
                   Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

         The Governor snarls and draws his sword.

         He attacks! Puss parkours off a tower of hors d'oeuvres,
         leaps onto an ice sculpture and slides away, avoiding the
         Governor's blows.



                             PUSS
                   Puss in Boots has never been
                   touched by a blade.

         Two band members echo Puss.

                             BAND MEMBERS
                       (singing)
                   Never been touched!

                               PUSS
                   But you--

         On cue, the Governor's wig splits in half, his belt snaps,
         and his pants drop around his ankles. The Governor stands
         there in a frilly pair of undies, wilting beneath gales of
         laughter.

                             GOVERNOR
                   Skin that cat!

         Puss leaps into the wheelbarrow full of fireworks. He strikes
         a match, enjoying himself immensely.

                             PUSS
                   Governor...
                       (touching a fuse)
                   Lighten up!

         FWOOSH! Puss flies from a cloud of smoke, riding a SKYROCKET
         like a bucking bronco. He zeroes in on the Governor, who
         leaps sprawling for cover, dropping his pants. Puss abandons
         ship as the rocket shoots toward the ceiling.


         EXT. DEL MAR - COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

         The sky above the Governor's mansion explodes with fireworks.
         The sound booms and rebounds from the surrounding mountains.

         One of the mountains shudders, shifts-- and then STANDS. A
         colossal MOUNTAIN GIANT has been roused by the noise. He's a
         weird, elemental creature with huge antlers, an eye-patch--
         and an insatiable appetite.

         The giant lumbers toward the Governor's mansion, licking his
         chops.


         INT. CLIFFSIDE MANSION - BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

         Puss faces down three of the Governor's men, disarming them
         easily.



                             PUSS
                   Ha, ha, ha-- uh-oh.

         A dozen more leap at Puss, DOG-PILING onto him, a heap of
         tangled limbs and armor. WHIP PAN to a nearby table where
         Puss reclines, totally at ease, sipping a cool glass of
         leche.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Silly guards, dog-piles don't work
                   on cats!

         Suddenly, the room shudders, pitching so violently that Puss
         almost (almost) spills his drink. Debris cascades from above
         as the Mountain Giant tears the roof off and peers into the
         mansion, his one eye aglow, searching.
                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Holy frijoles!

                             PARTY GOER #2
                   You awoke the sleeping giant of Del
                   Mar!

         The giant scoops up a handful of people and places them in an
         enormous satchel. Snacks for later, no doubt.

         Puss springs into action as the giant hoists the Little Boy
         into the air!

                             LITTLE BOY
                   Wheee! I'm flying!

                             PUSS
                   No, you are not flying! I will save
                   you!

         The Governor is snatched up as well.

                             GOVERNOR
                   Save me, too!
                             PUSS
                   If it's convenient.

         On the bandstand: Puss leaps onto a double-bass, wedging
         himself in the strings like an arrow in an archer's bow.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (to bassist)
                   You! Launch me!
                       (to the band)
                   And the rest of you, play double-
                   time!



         The band plays rousing music as the bassist launches Puss
         skyward.

                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?


         EXT. DEL MAR - VILLAGE - DAWN

         Villagers fill the streets, watching.

         Puss in Boots soars through the air, sword straight, blade
         true, silhouetted against the dawn. The giant bellows and
         reaches out to catch him.

         CLOSE ON THE GIANT'S HAND, grasping, powerful, inevitable.
         FFFT! Puss zips in and STICKS his sword right under the
         giant's thumbnail. The crowd winces, feeling it.

                             PUSS
                   The Spanish Splinter!

         The giant regards his thumb for a long, slow-witted beat.
         Then--

                             MOUNTAIN GIANT
                   Yeeeaaahhhhhgh!

         He shakes his hand in agony, flinging Puss deep into the
         village. Puss crashes through tenant buildings, bursting
         through multiple apartments and finally into--

         A KITCHEN: where a MAN sits, enjoying a cup of espresso. Puss
         grabs the cup from the man's hand.

                              PUSS
                   Gracias.

         The espresso does the job. Puss MEOWS, slams the cup onto the
         table and launches back into action, revived.

         BACK WITH THE GIANT: who smashes through a BELL TOWER, rips
         the bell free and starts swinging it around like a wrecking
         ball. Buildings are reduced to rubble.

         Puss appears, running on the rooftops, returning to the
         fight. VILLAGERS CHEER like crowds at a football match.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Fear me, if you dare!

         Puss JUMPS onto the BELL, hitching a ride as the Mountain
         Giant whips it into the air! From inside the giant's satchel:

                             VILLAGER
                       (muffled)
                   Help! Please, se�or!

         Puss leaps onto the satchel and cuts a strap. The captive
         villagers CHEER as they swing gently to the ground and run
         for freedom.

                             LITTLE BOY
                   Yay!

         Now, Puss presses the attack, making an unbelievable AERIAL
         SPIN and landing with his tiny sword planted in the giant's
         shoulder. The giant HOWLS. Puss whispers in his ear.

                              PUSS
                       (quiet)
                   Hey giant, pray for mercy from...
                       (loud)
                   Puss in Boots!

         Puss grabs onto the huge eyepatch and slides it over the
         giant's one good eye. The giant blindly swings the bell. The
         bell rope cinches around his antlers, tightening as the bell
         spins in diminishing circles.

         At the last moment, Puss lifts the eyepatch.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Hey, you want to see something
                   cool?

         DONNGGG! The bell slams hard into the giant's temple. He
         staggers, stiffens, then crashes like a felled redwood.

         The music CRESCENDOS! Puss leaps to safety, using his sword
         to slow his momentum as he slides through the streets,
         drawing a trademark capital "P" in the sand.
         Dust fills the streets of Del Mar. When it clears, we see the
         giant, down for the count, the bell swinging from his
         antlers. Puss stands before him, striking a pose, a total
         hero. Villagers gather around him and cheer.

                             CROWD
                   PUSS IN BOOTS! PUSS IN BOOTS!

         Puss smiles, drinking it all in. He accepts a bouquet of
         flowers from a chicken.

                             PUSS
                   Gracias, Del Mar! You've been
                   great! Get home safely! Goodnight!

         Puss walks out of frame. The crowd keeps chanting. After a
         long beat, Puss pokes his head back into the shot.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   You still here?

         The crowd roars. Puss struts back in with his guitar.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Okay, okay, one more number...
                   I call this one, "The Legend Will
                   Never Di--"
         DONNGGG! The BELL lands right on PUSS, smashing him flat!

                             CROWD
                   Ohhh!

                             LITTLE BOY
                   Puss in Boots!

         Lights out. Show's over.

                                                        CUT TO BLACK.


         INT. VET'S OFFICE - DAY

         Darkness. And then a voice.

                             VOICE
                   Puss? Puss? Puss in Boots?

         Puss opens his eyes. Coming into focus, a 17TH CENTURY
         VETERINARY OFFICE. Puss is lying on an examination table.
         Standing before him, THE VET, an energetic oddball with a
         fancy hair-do.
                             PUSS
                       (groggy)
                   Where-- where am I?

                             VET
                   Not to worry, You're in good hands.
                   MY hands.

         The Vet GRABS Puss and hoists him up.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   I am the village doctor.

         He examines Puss with an array of medieval instruments, rapid
         fire.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   I am also the village barber,
                   veterinarian, dentist and witch-
                   finder!

         Poof! The Vet tosses a handful of medicinal powders into
         Puss' face.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   And in my professional opinion: you
                   need a wash, a blow out and a
                   little trim around the
                   hindquarters.
                             PUSS
                   Uh--

                             VET
                   That's my professional BARBER
                   opinion. But! Putting on my
                   doctor's hat--

         He puts on his DOCTORS HAT. It's an actual hat, fixed with
         candles, powerful lenses and reflecting mirrors.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   I think we need to run a few tests.
                   Reflexes!

         The Vet raps Puss on the knee with a MALLET. Puss cat-slaps
         him ten times in the face.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   Cat-like. Temperature! Now lift
                   your tail and relax.

         The Vet produces a THERMOMETER, spins Puss around and lifts
         his tail. Puss grabs the thermometer and tosses it away.
                             PUSS
                   Trust me, I run hot. Yup.

         The Vet hoists up a LARGE JAR.

                             VET
                   Then how about the latest in modern
                   medical technology? Leeches! To
                   draw out the evil humors...

         The Vet seizes a LEECH from the jar and comes at Puss. Puss
         HISSES.

                                VET (CONT'D)
                      Suit yourself. More for me.

         The Vet drops the leech down his own collar.

                                PUSS
                      Listen, doctor. Thanks for
                      everything, you know, but I am
                      feeling great! Strong, like the
                      bull! You know? Now, do you know a
                      good place to get some gazpacho?

                                VET
                      Puss, this is serious.

                                PUSS
                      What is it?

                                VET
                      Puss in Boots...How do I say this?
                      You DIED.

                                PUSS
                      Doctor, please...
                          (bright)
                      Relax! I am Puss in Boots. I laugh
                      at death! Ha, ha, ha-- you see? And
                      anyway, I am a cat. I have NINE
                      LIVES.

                                VET
                      And how many times have you died
                      already?

                                PUSS
                      I dunno, I never counted. I am not
                      really a "math guy".

                                VET
                      Gato--
                                PUSS
                      Take it easy, doctor. Let's see...
                          (thinks)
                      There was the running of the bulls
                      in Pamplona...


         FLASHBACKS

         EXT. THE STREETS OF PAMPLONA, SPAIN - DAY

         Puss is in the middle of the RUNNING OF THE BULLS. He skids
         to a stop and talks to a pretty se�orita.

                             PUSS
                   Hola, se�orita. Do you like
                   gazpacho?

         The bulls trample Puss flat. That makes ONE DEATH.


         INT. A CASINO ON THE C�TE D'AZUR - NIGHT

         Puss sits at a gaming table, surrounded by the iconic POKER
         PLAYING DOGS. He lays down five aces on the felt.

                             PUSS
                   Guess it's not your night, huh
                   fellas?

         The dogs leap at Puss, SNARLING. That's TWO DEATHS.


         EXT. BARVARIAN ROOFTOPS - DAY

         Puss stands on the top of an impossibly tall tower, calling
         down to festival goers below. He's kitted out in lederhosen
         and holding a sloshing stein of leche.

                             PUSS
                       (tipsy)
                   And I'm telling you, a cat always
                   lands on his feet! Watch!

         Puss leaps heedlessly from the tower and plunges toward the
         streets. That's DEATH NUMBER THREE.


         EXT. A MEDIEVAL GYMNASIUM - DAY

         Puss sits on a weight bench, about to press a barbell loaded
         with tons of plates. A spotter stands behind him, but Puss
         waves him away.

                             PUSS
                   No! Puss in Boots doesn't need a
                   spotter. Watch!

         Puss struggles to lift the weight-- and fails. Fatally. FOUR.


         EXT. A PORT TOWN - PORTUGAL - DAY

         Puss is on the deck of a ship anchored offshore. He climbs
         into the mouth of a cannon.

                             PUSS
                   No need to pull into port! This
                   will revolutionize travel! Watch!

         BOOM! DEATH NUMBER FIVE.


         INT. A PARISIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

         Puss has his head down, eating a plate of food. A waiter
         stands nearby.

                             PUSS
                   Excuse me, does this have shellfish
                   in it?

                               WAITRESS
                   Yes, sir.

         Puss looks up, revealing his face. It's swollen. Horribly.

                               PUSS
                         (shrugging it off)
                   Eh.

         Puss goes back to eating: DEATH NUMBER SIX.


         INT. DRURY LANE BAKERY - DAY

         Puss and GINGY stand in front of a red-hot oven as muffins
         bake.

                             GINGY
                   Puss, I think you set the oven too
                   high!

                             PUSS
                       (scoff)
                   I'm a master of the baking. Watch!

         Flames suddenly explode from the oven, burning Puss to a
         crisp. That makes SEVEN.

                                                           BACK TO

         THE VET'S OFFICE, as Puss stands there adding up deaths.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   And then there was the giant today.
                       (counting)
                   So what is that, like... four?
6


                             VET
                   That makes eight, Puss. You are
                   down to your last life.
                       (writing on clipboard)
                   My prescription: no more adventures
                   for you! You need to RETIRE.

                             PUSS
                   Me, retire? Are you the village
                   comedian as well?

                             VET
                   Puss, is there any safe place you
                   can go? Any special someone you can
                   rely on in this moment of need?

                             PUSS
                   I am Puss in Boots, loved by one
                   and all.

                             VET
                   Anyone in particular?

                             PUSS
                   I mean-- uh, how could I possibly
                   choose?

         The Vet scribbles on a card and hands it to Puss. Puss
         regards it dubiously.

                             VET
                   This is the address of Mama Luna.
                   She is a cat fancier, always on the
                   lookout for a new lap-cat. You will
                   be safe there.

         Puss leaps from the exam table and heads for the exit.

                             PUSS
                   Lap-cat?! I am no lap-cat, Doctor.
                       (again, emphatically)
                   I am Puss in Boots!

                             VET
                   Not any more. Barber's orders.
                       (correcting)
                   I mean, Doctor's orders.

         Puss opens the exam room door and heads for the exit, not
         looking back.

                             VET (CONT'D)
                   And remember, Puss. Death comes for
                   us all.

         The Vet rattles a jar of complimentary CAT TREATS.

                               VET (CONT'D)
                   Treat?

         Puss stops-- then reluctantly returns for his treat, grabbing
         the whole jar.

                             PUSS
                       (munching away)
                   You've really got to work on your
                   bedside manner!

         Puss stomps off, taking the jar of treats with him.

         INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

         QUICK SHOTS: Milk is steamed, poured into a shot glass and
         slid down a bar top.

         WIDER: It's late. The tavern is empty. Puss sits at the bar,
         lapping shots of heavy cream, contemplating his future and
         his fate.

                             PUSS
                       (muttering to himself)
                   I am Puss in Boots, I am no one's
                   lap-cat. That doctor is a quack and
                   a crazy man. He should stick to
                   cutting hair...

                             BARTENDER
                   Last call, Se�or Boots.

                             PUSS
                   Another glass of cream. Make it
                   your heaviest.

                             BARTENDER
                   I keep the heavy stuff in the back.
         The Bartender exits. Puss regards his reflection in the
         mirror over the bar.

                             PUSS
                   Retire? Hah! You are too good
                   looking to retire.

         A breeze howls through the tavern. Candles flicker, casting
         creepy shadows. And then... the sound of WHISTLING. It's
         tuneless, haunting. And close.

         Puss looks over to see an immense, white WOLF sitting on the
         barstool beside him. He's hooded, staring straight ahead--

         Finally, the Wolf turns to Puss and smiles, showing a tangle
         of sharp teeth.

                             WOLF
                   Well, well, if it isn't Puss in
                   Boots himself.
                       (chuckles)
                   In the flesh.

         He lingers on the word "flesh," savoring it.

                               PUSS
                   Uh-- hey.

                             WOLF
                   There's the famous hat. The
                   feather. And of course, the boots.
                       (appraising them)
                   My compliments to your cobbler.

                             PUSS
                       (turning away)
                   Thanks. Good to meet you, too.

                             WOLF
                   Hey, I never do this, but-- can I
                   get your autograph? Been following
                   you for a long time.

         The Wolf unrolls the Puss in Boots bounty poster ("Wanted:
         Dead or Alive!") on the bar top. He taps the word DEAD with
         one terrible claw, over and over again.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Sign right there.

         Puss regards the Wolf cooly. He gets it.
                             PUSS
                   Puss in Boots laughs in the face of
                   death-- bounty hunter.

                             WOLF
                   So I've heard.

                             PUSS
                   You will find your reward does not
                   come easily, this I tell you.

         Puss stands up on his barstool, paw hovering over his sword.
         The Wolf calmly pours himself a drink.

                             WOLF
                   Everyone thinks they'll be the one
                   to defeat me, but no one's escaped
                   me yet.

                             PUSS
                       (yawns)
                   Let's get this over with.
                       (drawing his sword)
                   Fear me, if you--

         CLANG! The sword is knocked from Puss' paw! He blinks and
         runs to retrieve it.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Okay, no more messing around. Hah!
         Puss charges, flips acrobatically and swipes his blade at the
         Wolf. The Wolf evades it with ease.

                             WOLF
                       (dodging blows)
                   Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

         The Wolf pulls two SICKLES from his belt and attacks. The
         fight is on, a furious exchange: flashing blades, the ring of
         steel-on-steel.

         Puss leaps high, attempting his signature AERIAL SPIN move.
         The Wolf easily plucks him from the air and casts him to the
         ground.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   You're not living up to the legend,
                   gato.

         The Wolf is relentless, supernaturally fast. His blade
         flashes out, CUTTING Puss' brow! Puss drops his sword.
         Something's wrong. Something's changed.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                       (sniffing)
                   Ahh, I just love the smell of fear.

         The Wolf stalks towards Puss, scraping his blades across the
         flagstones, drawing sparks.

         MONTAGE: Images from Puss' past lives are cut to the
         quickening beat of his heart: Puss as a kitten-- Puss getting
         his first pair of boots-- Puss standing heroically before a
         cheering crowd--

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   What's the matter? Lives flashing
                   before your eyes?

         Puss looks at his sword. It's lying nearby. So close.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Pick it up.

         But Puss is frozen, afraid to make a move.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Pick. It. Up.

         He can't. Puss runs from the fight, leaving the sword behind.

         INT. TAVERN RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

         Puss charges in, latches the door, looks around. He's in a
         tiny restroom with no window-- and no way out. From outside
         the door, WHISTLING...

         A sickle slips through the jamb and SLICES the latch. The
         Wolf enters, scowling into the shadows, eyes glowing an
         uncanny red.

         But now the room is empty.

                             WOLF
                       (chuckles)
                   Corre corre gatito.


         EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF DEL MAR - POND - NIGHT

         Puss shoots from a sewer drain and splashes into a murky
         pond. He paddles to shore, gasping for breath. Then, without
         hesitation, he runs into the night.

         EXT. THE WILDERNESS - DAY/NIGHT

         MONTAGE: Puss travels beneath sun and moon, a haunted-looking
         figure in the wilderness.


         EXT. MAMA LUNA'S CAT RESCUE - DAY

         Puss is standing outside a well-kept Spanish home. It's
         brightly painted, with a walled courtyard and lots of
         flowers.
1


         Puss consults the card the Vet gave him: MAMA LUNA'S CAT
         RESCUE. This must be the place.

         Puss enters the courtyard. He removes his hat with great
         ceremony. After that, he takes off his cape, his belt and
         finally-- his boots.

                                                           CUT TO:

         Puss, gazing into an OPEN GRAVE as rain begins to fall.

                             PUSS
                   I am no longer worthy. I am sorry.

         His famous costume is lying in the grave. Puss places a rose
         upon it and delivers a eulogy to the empty yard.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   We are gathered here today to say
                   goodbye to Puss in Boots.

         He struggles to speak, in the grip of high emotion.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   There-- there are no words to
                   express such a loss...Thank you.

         Puss walks out of frame. Then, he walks right back.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   But, it would be a crime not to
                   try. He was known across the land
                   by many names: The Stabby Tabby, El
                   Macho Gato, The Leche Whisperer.
                   To some, an outlaw. To more, a
                   hero. To all, a legend.
                       (sighs, slumps)
                   I was right... words were not
                   enough.

         Puss walks off. Walks back in.
                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   But, perhaps a song.
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?
                       (breaking down)
                   You were... you were...

         Puss sobs bitterly, back-kicking dirt into the grave, burying
         his costume and bidding goodbye to the life he loved.

         HIGH ANGLE: Mama Luna's house casts a long shadow over Puss
2


         as he approaches. Cat-themed wind chimes stir. On the
         rooftop, a CAT WEATHERVANE spins.

         Puss steps onto the front porch and drops into the four-
         legged posture of a ordinary cat. He knocks on the door.

                             MAMA LUNA (O.S.)
                   I told you health department
                   people, there are no cats here!

         The door opens and MAMA LUNA peers out uncertainly. She's a
         hippy-dippy old lady with colorful clothes, coke bottle
         glasses and terrible eyesight.

                              PUSS
                   < MEOW!>

         Luna opens the door wider-- expertly posing to block cats
         from bolting outside.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   Oh! You're not from the health
                   department are you? No you're not!

         Mama Luna sweeps Puss into her arms and hugs him. Tight.

                             MAMA LUNA (CONT'D)
                   We better get you inside, baby.
                       (conspiratorially)
                   Because they are always watching.

         Luna takes Puss inside, SLAMMING the door.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

         Mama Luna walks with Puss cradled in her arms.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   I am Mama Luna and this is my home.
                   And now, it's your home too.
         Puss' POV: towering stacks of kitty-litter bags and kibble.
         It's cat care on an industrial scale.

                             MAMA LUNA (CONT'D)
                   Your FOREVER home.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - BATHROOM - DAY

         Puss is in a bathtub, totally covered with fluffy soap suds,
         getting roughly scrubbed with a shower sponge.
3


         WIDER: Mama is sitting in the tub with him, wearing a
         SHOWERCAP, HUMMING happily as she scrubs away.

                             MAMA LUNA
                       (singing)
                   The kitty gets a bath-- the kitty
                   gets a bath-- hi ho, the derry-o--

         NEXT: Mama Luna dries puss with a towel. His fur POOFS UP
         like a blowfish.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - DAY

         CLOSE ON PUSS, washed, groomed and SCOWLING.

                             MAMA LUNA (O.S.)
                   Bet you've never even had a name.
                   But I've thought of something
                   perfect. I shall call you--PICKLES!

         Click-Clack! A leather collar is snapped around Puss' neck.
         The tag reads: PICKLES.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - DAY

         Puss is carried into the room, wearing custom-knitted blue
         booties and mittens. There are cats everywhere. EVERYWHERE.
         Hundreds of them-- all of them wearing COLORFUL MITTENS.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   Brother cats! Sister kitties! Meet
                   your new roommate!

         Luna sets Puss down. The cats are sleepy and lazy and regard
         him with little interest.

                             MAMA LUNA (CONT'D)
                   Say hello, Pickles!
                                PUSS
                   Um-- Meow?

         The cats look shocked and offended.

                             THE "OHH" CAT
                       (covering his mouth)
                   Oh-hhh.

                             PUSS
                   What? Did I say something salty?
                   It's my second language.

         Puss walks into the room, a proud gato struggling to shake
         off the silly mittens.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Stupid mittens. Get off me.

         As Puss walks through the crowd of cats, he spots a cat
         wearing a cone. It looks up at Puss, revealing it has severe
         pink eye and a disgusting runny nose.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Oh no.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - BATHROOM - DAY
         Puss' back is to us. He stands on the TOILET-SEAT, using it
         like a human.

                             PUSS
                       (relieved)
                   Ahhhhh--

         Suddenly, a spray bottle enters frame and gives him a SQUIRT.
         Puss YOWLS, shocked. Mama Luna appears, gently scolding him.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   This is a person potty, Pickles.
                   That's your potty...

         Mama Luna POINTS OFF. THE CAMERA follows her gesture,
         whipping over to...

         A LONG LINE OF CATS waiting to use a LITTER BOX. The box is
         occupied by a huge PERSIAN CAT who fixes Puss with an
         unselfconscious stare. Puss approaches the box, appalled.

                             PUSS
                   So this is where dignity goes to
                   die.

         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - DAY

         Mama Luna hoists up a huge bag of kibble, tears it open with
         her teeth and dumps it into a large FEEDING TROUGH. Cats go
         WILD, stampeding toward the trough, practically knocking Puss
         over as they crowd up to eat.

         Puss sniffs the kibble and wrinkles his nose. He tries a
         little taste--

                             PUSS
                       (spitting it out)
                   Ugh! No, no, no way.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - KITCHEN - LATER

         Puss is standing on top of the stove, fussing over a pot,
         adding spices to a proper meal.

         A spray bottle enters frame and gives a corrective SQUIRT.
         Puss leaps away, yowling.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   Uh, uh, uh.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - AFTERNOON

         HIGH ANGLE: A PATCH OF SUNLIGHT on the floor. Puss walks in
         gloomily and lies down. A bunch of other cats push in around
         him, wanting to lie in the sun too. Puss stares up at the
         ceiling, crammed in like a sardine.


         EXT. MAMA LUNA'S - SUNSET/SUNRISE

         The cat weathervane spins, squeaking. TIME LAPSE: the sun
         sets, the stars wheel overhead, then a NEW DAY BEGINS.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - MORNING

         QUICK SHOTS: Mama Luna RIPS open a bag of kibble. She DUMPS
         the bag into the KIBBLE TROUGH. Cats RUSH to it.

         Puss watches, his resolve giving way to resignation.

                             PUSS
                   Meow?

         HIGH ANGLE: THE PATCH OF SUNLIGHT on the floor. Again, Puss
         lies there, crammed in by the other cats, staring at the
         ceiling.


         EXT. MAMA LUNA'S - SUNSET/SUNRISE

         Time lapse: The WEATHERVANE spins. Sunset, night, dawn,
         whipping past-- faster, faster, faster.

         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - MORNING

         Puss is squatting in the LITTER BOX, looking shamefaced and
         far from legendary. Other cats wait in line, glaring--

                                                           CUT TO:

         Feeding time at the KIBBLE TROUGH: PANNING PAST dozens of
         cats, chomping away. THE CAMERA is looking for Puss, but it
         overshoots-- that's how much he's changed.

         Puss in Boots looks up from the trough, munching. He's a
         different gato: BEARDED, unkempt, totally institutionalized.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK


         EXT. DEL MAR - NIGHT

         CLOSE ON: Puss' BOUNTY POSTER, held in someone's hands. It's
         lowered to reveal that we're near the ruins of the Governor's
         mansion.

         A HUGE BEAR is crowding the frame, nose against the ground,
         sniffing. There's a GIRL riding the bear's back. She seems
         feral, her hair set in tangled, childlike braids.

         The girl's holding a wooden staff. It looks like a shepherd's
         staff, but shepherding is Bo-Peep's game-- this thing is a
         bludgeon and it's wielded by GOLDILOCKS, sixteen and tough as
         nails. The bear she's riding: the brutal BABY BEAR.

         MAMA BEAR and PAPA BEAR follow, lumbering close behind. Baby
         GROWLS against the wind.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You got the scent?

         Goldilocks leaps down and appraises CHICKEN TRACKS in the
         earth.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   These are too small...

         HIGH ANGLE: Goldi is standing in a MASSIVE FOOTPRINT, a
         remnant of Puss' battle with the giant.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   And these are too big.
                       (noticing)
                   Ah, but these ones--!

         She's looking at PUSS' BOOTPRINTS.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   These ones are just right. Baby,
                   track that cat!

         A GRAPHIC INSERT smashes into frame. It's another BOUNTY
         POSTER (Wanted: Goldilocks and the Three Bears Crime family)
         with fierce looking images of the accused-- MAMA, PAPA, BABY
         AND GOLDI.

         Baby resumes sniffing. Goldilocks and the Three Bears head
         off into the night, hot on the trail of the famous gato.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - DAY

         Another session at the feeding trough. Mama Luna rips open a
         bag and pours the kibble out. Dozens of cats gobble it up,
         Puss in Boots among them.

         The tail of the cat next to him is wagging happily. It whacks
         Puss in the head. Several times.

                             PUSS
                   Do you mind? Trying to eat, here.
                       (catching himself)
                   I mean-- "meow-whatever."

         The cat looks up. Except it's NOT a cat-- it's DOG, a tiny,
         teacup mutt in a filthy sweater. Dog is wearing a ludicrous
         CAT DISGUISE with broom-bristle whiskers and a feather duster
         tail.

                              DOG
                   Oh, Sorry.
                       (realizing)
                   Oh! Oh, oh, you're a talking cat?!
                   I'm a talking cat! Let's talk!

                             PUSS
                       (sighs)
                   I'd rather eat.
                             DOG
                   Not a problem!

         Dog takes a bite of kibble and talks with his mouth full.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (spraying kibble)
                   We can eat and talk at the same
                   time!

                             PUSS
                   No hablo Ingl�s.

         Puss drops his head back into the trough.

                             DOG
                   Hablas Espa�ol? Yo tambi�n! De
                   donde eres? Te gusta las siestas?

         Puss lifts his head back up.

                             PUSS
                   I don't speak Spanish either.

                             DOG
                   You're funny!

                             PUSS
                       (turning away)
                   Okay. Good talk.

         Dog notices the tag on Puss' collar.

                             DOG
                   Oh hang on! Pickles? Is that your
                   name? Me, I don't have a name-- or
                   a home--

         GRAPHIC INSERT: Instead of a WANTED poster, Dog has a hand
         lettered "UNWANTED" poster that reads, DOG NEEDS HOME. It has
         little tear-off info strips on the bottom, none of them
         taken.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   So I'm no expert, but you don't
                   look like a Pickles to me.

                             PUSS
                   Well, you don't look like a cat.

         Puss heads off. Dog follows.

                             DOG
                       (whisper)
                   Okay, okay, okay. Full disclosure,
                   I'm not a cat. I'm a DOG.
                       (noticing Mama Luna)
                   Shh...

         Mama Luna strolls past. Dog poses and feigns a MEOW and a
         phony PURR.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   Oh! Pickles has a new girlfriend!
                   Okay...

         Mama passes. Dog catches up with Puss.

                             DOG
                   I live under the porch. It can get
                   a little lonely down there. It's
                   mostly controlled by the rats and
                   the centipedes, but I have my own
                   little corner.

                             PUSS
                   Congratulations.

                             DOG
                   I just come up here for the food
                   and the friends.

          Several cats HISS at him.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Mostly the food. Please! Don't tell
                   anyone! I need this!

                             PUSS
                   I won't tell. I don't care.

                             DOG
                   So, you'll keep my secret? A secret
                   between friends?

                             PUSS
                   Just a secret.

                             DOG
                   It's funny, despite all this best
                   friend bonding, you're still a
                   mystery to me, Pickles. What's your
                   story?

                                PUSS
                   My story--

         DRAMATIC MUSIC swells. Puss looks off, eyes brimming, as
         heroic images of his past rise before him.
                             DOG
                       (following Puss' gaze)
                   What are we looking at?

                                PUSS
                   --is over!

                             DOG
                       (gasps)
                   Oh, no! Wanna rub my belly?

         Dog sits back on his haunches and slowly hikes up his
         sweater, revealing a pudgy tummy.

                             PUSS
                   What's happening?

                                DOG
                   Rub!

                                PUSS
                   Hard pass.

                             DOG
                   C'mon, rub. I need the practice.
                   I'm gonna be a therapy dog someday.

                             PUSS
                   What the hell are you talking
                   about?

                             DOG
                   I'm glad you asked! When people
                   feel bad, they can rub my belly.
                   It'll make them feel better!
                       (sudden determination)
                   Rub my belly!

                                PUSS
                   No.

                             DOG
                   C'mon. RUB IT.

                             PUSS
                   No. Not happening.

                                DOG
                   RUB IT!

         Puss escapes, ascending a cat tower.

                             PUSS
                       (climbing)
                   No! Let me be clear: I don't. Want.
                   To touch. Your belly.

                             DOG
                   Okie-doke! So what do you want?

         Puss curls up to sleep.

                             PUSS
                   I want to be left alone.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.


         INT. MAMA LUNA'S - PARLOR - DAWN

         It's quiet. Sleeping cats all over the place. Mama Luna
         dozes, cozy in her armchair, practically covered in lap-cats.

         Puss In Boots is taking advantage of this rare moment of
         privacy to squat in the LITTER BOX. He sighs bitterly-- how
         the mighty have fallen.

         CAMERA ADJUST reveals that Dog is sitting beside the litter
         box, staring right at him, not blinking.

                             PUSS
                       (startled)
                   AHH! You're back!

                             DOG
                       (still not blinking)
                   I never left.

         Suddenly, a CREAKING SOUND: something heavy is walking on the
         front porch. A scary SILHOUETTE passes a window. A BIG NOSE
         sniffs under the front door. The door knob jiggles.

                             PUSS
                       (scared)
                   The wolf. He's found me.

         A suspended moment of tension, then-- BOOM! Papa Bear and
         Baby Bear BURST through the front door, smashing it into
         splinters! Startled cats race around the room, YOWLING in
         terror. Puss and Dog zip beneath a side table, peering out
         from the shadows.

         Mama Luna stands defiantly as Goldilocks enters with Mama
         Bear.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Hello, missus. We're looking for a
                   cat.

         Goldi unrolls Puss' bounty poster and holds it in front of
         Luna's eyes.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   This cat. We've got an offer for
                   him.

         From his hiding place, Puss reacts.

                             PUSS
                   What could they possibly want to
                   offer Puss in Boots?

                             DOG
                   What's a Puss in Boots?

                                PUSS
                   Seriously?

         Mama Luna pushes the bounty poster away. She's feisty!

                             MAMA LUNA
                   I told you health department
                   people, there are no cats here!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Make her talk.

         Papa Bear looms over Mama Luna, opens his terrible jaws
         and... SPEAKS in a surprisingly cheerful cockney accent.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Excuse me, my darling! We're
                   looking for the legendary Puss in
                   Boots. Have you perhaps--

         Mama Luna breaks A BROOM over Papa's head.

                             PAPA BEAR (CONT'D)
                       (totally unfazed)
                   --seen him?

                                GOLDILOCKS
                   Too soft.

         Mama Bear holds her razor-sharp claw to Luna's throat like a
         dagger.
                             MAMA BEAR
                   Out with it, you old biddy, or I'll
                   have your guts for garters!

         Mama Luna faints dead away.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Too hard! That was not JUST RIGHT!
                   Oi, Baby! Sniff him out.

                             BABY BEAR
                   You don't tell me what to do.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Listen to your sister, Baby!

                             BABY BEAR
                   She's not my sister, she's a
                   fugitive orphan!

         Papa slaps the back of Baby's head.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   She is your sister! Do as she says!

         Baby reluctantly complies, scooting his nose around the
         floor, sniffing.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Fine. But all I can smell is cat
                   pee.

         Mama Luna is back on her feet, running through scene with an
         armful of frightened cats.

                             MAMA LUNA
                   Everybody get to the safe room,
                   just like we practiced! Follow me,
                   children!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Oi! She's leggin' it!

         Papa Bear reaches out and easily snatches Luna up.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Give her the piano treatment, Papa.

         Papa crosses the room and STUFFS Mama Luna into an upright
         PIANO. Her legs stick out from the top, bicycling in the air.

                             MAMA LUNA
                       (muffled)
                   Ha! You think this is the first
                   time I've been stuffed in a piano?!

         Papa sits on the piano bench, which nearly buckles under his
         weight. He cracks his knuckles and starts to play, cutting
         loose with a jaunty music-hall tune.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Here we go!
                       (singing)
                   Roll out the barrel, we'll have a
                   barrel of fun.

         A MUSICAL INTERLUDE as the piano plays over chaotic action:
         cats yowl and stampede! They knock stuff off shelves! They
         claw their way up and down drapes!

                             PAPA BEAR (CONT'D)
                       (singing)
                   Roll out the barrel! We've got the
                   blues on the run. Zing boom
                   tararrel! Sing out a song of good
                   cheer--

         Meanwhile, Mama Bear is indulging in a bit of petty larceny,
         trying on some of Luna's hats and checking her look in a
         mirror.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Mama! Focus, please.

         Mama abandons the hats and gets back to business. Baby sniffs
         his way over to a closet and opens it. Dozens of cats tumble
         out, scrambling up his legs, hissing and clawing him
         savagely.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Ahhrrgh! There's cats everywhere!
                   There's so many cats!

         Baby stumbles, SMASHES through a window and falls into a
         flowerbed. He stands and calmly brushes himself off,
         attempting to reclaim his dignity.

                             BABY BEAR (CONT'D)
                   I'll be outside.

                             PAPA BEAR
                       (singing)
                   Now's the time to roll out the
                   barrel...

         Mama Luna pops her head out of the piano.
                             MAMA LUNA
                   My cats can play better than you!

         Papa shoves Luna's head down, closes the lid and keeps
         playing.

         PUSS AND DOG to watch from their hiding place. Puss ROLLS HIS
         EYES at the clumsy bears and their strong-arm tactics.

                             PUSS
                   Pff. Amateurs.

         Suddenly, Mama Bear reaches down, GRABS DOG and lifts him
         into the air! She presents him to Goldi.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Goldi, is this him?

                             GOLDILOCKS (O.S.)
                   That's a dog in a cat costume.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Oh yeah... Tricky little bugger!

         Mama casts Dog aside, seizes Puss by the scruff of the neck
         and yanks him from his hiding place!

                             MAMA BEAR (CONT'D)
                   How about this one? He's a ginger.

         Goldi compares the image on the bounty poster with the
         raggedy cat hanging in Mama's grasp.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Is that a joke? You think this
                   scruffy, geriatric bag of bones
                   looks like a legend? This is
                   definitely not--

         From outside:

                             BABY BEAR (O.S.)
                   Puss in Boots! I found him!


         EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

         The Three Bears and Goldi look down at Puss' grave. Baby
         gives it a SNIFF and nods sagely.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Puss in Boots: dead and buried.
                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Dead? No, no, no! He can't be!

                             BABY BEAR
                   Yup! The nose never lies.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Well, that's that, then. What say
                   we go hibernate?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   No! The map is being delivered
                   tonight and we have one chance to
                   steal it. Without it, we'll never
                   find the Wishing Star.

         Puss is peeking from behind a tree trunk, eavesdropping on
         the bears' conversation.

                             PUSS
                       (to himself)
                   The Wishing Star? It does exist!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   That star has one wish to grant.

                             PUSS
                       (to himself)
                   One wish?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Think of what that could mean for
                   us!

         Puss is thinking about what it means for him.

                             PUSS
                   Nine lives! Yes!

                             BABY BEAR
                   Well, I don't see why we needed to
                   hire Puss in Boots in the first
                   place.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Because nobody steals from Big Jack
                   Horner!

                             PUSS
                   No! Not Jack Horner!

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Don't worry, love. We'll get that
                   wish, somehow...

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Thank you, Mama.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Yeah, because I'VE got a plan! I
                   can nick a map as good as any old
                   cat!

         Goldi LAUGHS derisively.
7


                             GOLDILOCKS
                   YOU'VE got a plan?

                             BABY BEAR
                   What? I'm smart, ain't I? Ain't I
                   Papa?

         Goldi and the bears exit.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   No, you ain't well fixed for
                   brains...

         Once the bears are gone, Puss steps from cover. He paces and
         plans, his eyes full of hope for the first time in a long
         time.

                             PUSS
                   Robbing Big Jack Horner... very
                   risky... But that wish could get me
                   my lives back-- and my LIFE back.

         Puss tosses away the blue mittens.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (decisively)
                   Goodbye, Pickles!

                             DOG
                   Oh no, Pickles. You're leaving?

         Puss points to the grave.

                             PUSS
                   Perro! Start digging!

         Dog paws away, rapidly unearthing the famous costume.

                             DOG
                   Okay. But, if this Puss in Boots is
                   such a big deal, maybe we shouldn't
                   be desecrating his grave.

                             PUSS
                   I don't think he will mind, because
                   he--

         QUICK CUTS: Puss dons the familiar hat, boots, cape.

                               PUSS (CONT'D)
                   -- is me!

         Puss draws his sword heroically... only, he no longer has a
         sword, so he's left posing with his empty hand in the air.

                             DOG
                   Oh-kayee...

                             PUSS
                   Uh, normally I have a sword.
                   It's like a whole thing, you know?

                             DOG
                       (it sinks in)
                   Pickles, YOU'RE Puss in Boots?!

                             PUSS
                   Not yet. But I will be!

         With that, Puss runs off, heading toward the horizon at high
         speed.

                             DOG
                   Wait! I'll come with you!

                             PUSS
                       (already far away)
                   Sorry, Perro! Puss in Boots walks
                   alone!


         EXT. PIE FACTORY - NIGHT

         The HORNER PIE FACTORY is a gothic pile looming over a warren
         of medieval streets. Its smokestacks stand tall against the
         moon, venting pie-steam.

         Closer: Obscuring steam clears frame, revealing Puss in Boots
         riding a WATERWHEEL up to a high factory wall. He watches as:

         A WAGON approaches at full gallop.


                             GUARD (O.S.)
                   Open the gate!

         Guards open a fortified gate and the wagon enters the
         factory's inner yard.

         The SERPENT SISTERS (JAN and JO) climb down from the wagon,
         bearing an ORNATE BOX. They're cut-throat mercenary-types,
         full of swagger. One of the guards reaches for the box. Jan
         holds up a knife, backing him off.

                             JAN
                   Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hands off the
                   merchandise. We got this!

         The sisters carry the box up the factory steps as henchmen
         load up the wagon with gold. Puss watches from above, trying
         to gin up his nerve. It's now or never.

                             PUSS
                       (self-motivating)
                   Okay. Just get in, and get out.
                   Easy-peasy.

                             DOG (O.S.)
                   Lemon squeezy!

         REVEAL: Dog is standing right next to Puss, holding a gnawed-
         up stick.

                             PUSS
                       (startled)
                   Ai! What are you doing here?

                             DOG
                   I brought you a sword.

                             PUSS
                   That's not a sword, that's a stick.

                             DOG
                   It's a stick-sword.

                              PUSS
                   Go home!

                             DOG
                   My home is where my friends are.

                             PUSS
                   Again, not friends.

         Dog lifts his sweater up and sticks out his belly.

                             DOG
                   Rub for luck?

                             PUSS
                   I don't need luck for this. I am a
                   highly skilled master cat thief.
                   Watch!

         Puss jumps into a narrow steam pipe. He gets instantly stuck,
         his back half dangling helplessly. Dog slips the sword-stick
         into Puss' scabbard and gives him a helpful shove.

                             DOG
                   You got this!

         Puss shimmies his way into the factory.


         INT. PIE FACTORY - NIGHT

         The Horner Pie Company's FADED LOGO is painted on a factory
         wall. It's an illustration of Little Jack Horner, a cherubic
         seven year old, giving a thumbs-up.

         A big, HAIRY HAND enters frame, also giving a thumbs-up. The
         thumb plunges into a freshly baked pie and pulls out a plum.

         REVEAL BIG JACK HORNER, looking dramatic in clouds of pie
         steam, sucking his thumb. He's plainly the kid from the logo,
         but he's aged into a burly man-child with a petulant mouth
         and cruel eyes.

         Big Jack smacks his lips, sampling the product. Nervous
         Bakers stand by, waiting on the verdict.

                              JACK HORNER
                   I pronounce this batch...
                       (more lip-smacking)
                   Delicious!

         GRAPHIC INSERT: Another BOUNTY POSTER smashes into frame
         (Wanted: Big Jack Horner).

         Jack wipes his thumb on his smock. The plum stains look
         unnervingly like blood.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Ship `em out!

         The bakers exhale, hugely relived. They cart off the pies.

                             JAN(O.S.)
                   Mister Horner! The Serpent Sisters
                   got the goods!

         Jack looks off to see the Serpent Sisters entering with the
         box. Puss in Boots watches from an air vent as Jack hurries
         to meet them.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Is it, is it?
                       (overjoyed)
                   The map to Wishing Star! Stop
                   everything. You two come with me.
                   We must get this to the trophy
                   room.

                             JO
                   You know it took a lot of murdering
                   to get this map. It all started...

                             JACK HORNER
                       (exploding)
                   TAKE IT TO THE TROPHY ROOM!

         Puss continues inching through the ducts as Jack and the
         sisters cross the factory floor.


         INT. PIE FACTORY - TROPHY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

         Shelves stretch to the ceiling, displaying famous fairy-tale
         props: poison apples, fairy godmother wands, a cursed
         spinning wheel, a pair of glass slippers, etc.

         Puss DROPS IN through the ceiling vent. He bumps into a
         gilded cage with a gold-feathered PHOENIX perched inside. The
         Phoenix SQUAWKS, singeing Puss' hind end with a jet of
         enchanted fire.

                                PUSS
                   What the--

         Puss swats out the flames and takes cover just as Big Jack
         enters with the Serpent Sisters.

                             JAN
                       (gasps)
                   Whoa! Look at all the magic stuff!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Yes, I collect enchanted objects,
                   magical icons, bobbles, gee-gaws,
                   ladee dah and blah, blah, blah.

         The sisters track mud across a MAGIC CARPET. The carpet
         flutters in protest.

                             JO
                   Check it out, I'm walkin' on a
                   magic carpet!

         Jan eyeballs a SHIP IN A BOTTLE manned by itty bitty sailors.

                             JAN
                   Suh-weet! The shrunken ship of the
                   Lilliputians!

         A cross-bow is displayed with UNICORN HORN-TIPPED ARROWS.

                             JO
                       (disbelief)
                   Shut. Up. Are those unicorn horns?

                             JACK HORNER
                   Baby unicorn horns. Half as heavy,
                   twice as sharp.

                                JAN
                   Savage!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Bah! They're trinkets! They're
                   nothing compared to the awesome
                   power of the magic Wishing Star!
                   Speaking of which--
                       (gestures impatiently)
                   Make with the box, sister.

                             JO
                   You got it boss! Like I was saying,
                   the amount of murdering--

                             JACK HORNER
                        (exploding)
                   MAKE WITH THE BOX!!!

         The Serpent Sisters hand the box to Jack. He crosses the
         room, places the box onto a desk and thrusts a key into the
         lock.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   After so many years of searching!
                   This is my moment.

         He turns the key, unlocking the chest. Puss crouches above,
         waiting for his chance.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   With this wish, I will FINALLY
                   be... the master of ALL MAGIC.
                             JO
                       (breaking in)
                   Hey, Little Jack?

                                JACK HORNER
                   Excuse me?

         Jack re-locks the chest and turns around, fuming.

                             JO
                   Could you do the thumb-thing? Like
                   in the fairy tale?

         Jan is horrified by her sister's blunder.

                             JAN
                   Shhhhh.

                             JACK HORNER
                       (bitterly)
                   It wasn't a fairy tale, it was only
                   a nursery rhyme.

                             JO
                   Oh, yeah. The lame one.
                       (reciting)
                   "Little Jack Horner sat in a
                   corner, eating a Horner pie--"

         ON JACK (furious!) as we dissolve to:

         A FLASHBACK

         Little Jack Horner (age 8) dances and sings on the stage of a
         show-wagon while his parents hawk pies. An audience of two or
         three people watch Little Jack's performance, not very
         interested.

                             LITTLE JACK HORNER
                       (singing)
                   I stuck in my thumb, pulled out a
                   plum and said what a good boy am
                   IIII!!

         Little Jack finishes big. It's crickets. No applause.
         Nothing. Then--

                             AUDIENCE MEMBER
                       (pointing off)
                   Look! A magic puppet!

         CAMERA PANS over to find PINOCCHIO, singing and dancing on an
         adjacent stage, surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd. Geppetto
         is manning a merch stall, hawking T-shirts, posters, bobble-
         heads.

                             PINOCCHIO
                       (singing)
                   Cause I'm a real boy. No strings
                   attached!

         The crowd goes crazy, cheering, showering Pinocchio with
         money and buying up tons of merchandise.

                             PINOCCHIO (CONT'D)
                   Thank you! Thank you!

                             LITTLE JACK HORNER
                   What's impressive? I've been a boy
                   the whole time!

         He smashes a pie onto the ground, scowling.

         MATCH DISSOLVE to Big Jack Horner's scowling face as we END
         FLASHBACK.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Little Jack Horner didn't have any
                   magic. He was a pathetic, buttered
                   baker's boy.

         Jack advances on the Serpent Sisters, pulling on A PAIR OF
         GLOVES.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                       (looming)
                   Little Jack's dead. I'm BIG JACK
                   HORNER.

         As Jack attends to the sisters, Puss drops onto the desk and
         stealthily picks the locked box with a single claw. CLICK!
         Success!

                             JAN (O.S.)
                   Uh, Mister Big Jack Horner, Sir? I
                   barely know her.

                             JO (O.S.)
                   Whaddya mean? We're sisters, ya
                   goof! We got matching face tattoos!

         Puss opens the box. Within, lies the ENCHANTED MAP, carefully
         rolled and sealed, shining with supernatural power.

                             PUSS
                   Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

         Puss takes the map into hand. He doesn't notice someone
         hiding INSIDE the box. It's another cat thief, masked but
         unmistakable: KITTY SOFTPAWS!

         Kitty KICKS Puss in the face. Hard.

                             KITTY
                       (realizing)
                   Puss?

                             PUSS
                   Kitty?

                             KITTY
                   Puss!

                             PUSS
                   Kitty!

         Kitty KICKS Puss in the face again. Harder.

         GRAPHIC INSERT: Another BOUNTY POSTER smashes into frame
         (Wanted: KITTY SOFTPAWS.)

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (recovering)
                   This is my job.

                             KITTY
                   No, this is my job. I'm
                   double-crossing the bears.

         Kitty walks off with the map. Puss grabs onto one end of it
         and yanks her back.

                             PUSS
                       (pulling on the map)
                   No, I'm double-crossing the bears.
                   They tried to hire me earlier
                   today.

                             KITTY
                       (pulling it back)
                   Well, they tried to hire me two
                   weeks ago. That makes you Plan B.

         Kitty and Puss keep yanking on the map, a back and forth
         TUG-OF-WAR. Meanwhile, Jack settles up with the Serpent
         Sisters, oblivious to the cats. He takes something from a
         high shelf.

                              JACK HORNER
                   Ah, there it is. Now, about your
                   payment...
         He holds a jeweled case before the sisters' eyes and opens
         it. THE GOLDEN HAND OF KING MIDAS is nestled inside, its
         index finger stabbing toward the ceiling.

                             JAN
                   Hold up. You promised us our weight
                   in gold.

                             JACK HORNER
                   I did, didn't I? Ever hear of the
                   Midas Touch?

                             JO
                   Cool! Dibs!

         Jo greedily grabs onto the HAND. Instantly, She notices--

                             JO (CONT'D)
                   Oh no. I misjudged the situation.

         Jack turns from them, chuckling, and returns the Midas Finger
         to its place. Puss and Kitty take cover as he passes.

                             PUSS
                       (whispering)
                   This is why you don't cross Jack
                   Horner!
         Puss is plainly terrified. Kitty doesn't notice. She's
         distracted, staring at Puss' SCRUFFY BEARD. She gives it a
         sharp tug.

                             KITTY
                   What is this? Are you a pirate now?

                               PUSS
                   Shhh.

                             KITTY
                   It's like a possum crawled on your
                   face and died.

                               PUSS
                   Shhh!

                               KITTY
                   Of shame.

                             PUSS
                   Please mock me quietly.

                             KITTY
                   I hate it. It's disgusting.
                             PUSS
                   Well, I love it. It's
                   distinguished.

         SOUNDS FROM OVERHEAD: Something VERY HEAVY is squeezing its
         way through the air vents, grunting with the effort.

         The ceiling creaks, bulges then-- GIVES WAY ENTIRELY!

         Baby Bear falls into the room, bouncing down the towering
         display cases and landing on the floor in a heap.

         Rope and a grappling hook follow, clanking him on the head.
         Goldi and the other bears drop down into the room.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Great plan, Baby. Real cat-like.

         A beat tense silence. The room's full of notorious characters
         who all know each other by reputation. Jan lingers awkwardly
         in the background of this standoff.

                             JAN
                   Uhhh, can I go?

         Jack waves her off, not sparing her a glance.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Pleasure doing blah-blah.

         Jan exits with her sister, now a SOLID GOLD STATUE in a
         wheelbarrow.

         BACK TO THE STANDOFF.

         QUICK CUTS over an exchange of rapid-fire dialogue:

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Puss in Boots?

                             PUSS
                   Goldi, Bears.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Kitty Softpaws! My you have a lot
                   of nerve coming back here.

                             KITTY
                   Please, I was the best thief you
                   ever hired!

                             JACK HORNER
                   You robbed me!

                             KITTY
                   YOU set me up!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                       (to Kitty)
                   You said you were going on a
                   spiritual retreat!

                              KITTY
                   Namaste.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                       (to Puss)
                   And YOU'RE supposed to be dead.

                             PUSS
                   I got better.

         Goldi tries to get things on track.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Ugh! Just give us the map!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   And throw in a dozen pies!

                               GOLDILOCKS
                   Eh?

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Ohh, have you got any savory pies?

                             BABY BEAR
                   Yeah! What flavors you got?

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Can we get all of that in a bag to
                   go?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Wha-- Would you stop talking about
                   blooming pies?! Focus!

         Goldi grabs the bottle with the Lilliputian Ship and breaks
         it over the side of the desk. She waves the broken end
         around, flinging Lilliputians into the air.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   Hand over the map, or I'll punch
                   holes in the lot of you!

         A CREAKING SOUND rises into the air. Stressed wood and
         timbers giving way--

                               MAMA BEAR
                   Oh, bums!

         The damaged display cases TOPPLE like giant DOMINOS!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Look out! It's coming down!

         Heavy shelves crash to the floor and enchanted relics
         shatter. The air is full of blinding light and billowing
         clouds of magical smoke!

         Puss and Kitty see a chance to escape with the map. They jump
         onto the MAGIC CARPET and grab the tassels. The carpet rears
         back like a spirited horse and flies into the air.

         Puss and Kitty shoot from the trophy room, knocking Jack onto
         his back.

                             PUSS
                   Hah!


         INT. PIE FACTORY - FACTORY FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

         Kitty and Puss fly through the factory. Jack emerges from the
         trophy room with an ENCHANTED TRIDENT. There's murder in his
         eyes.

                             JACK HORNER
                   I hate talking fairy tale animals!

         Jack CHUCKS the trident. It sails with uncanny accuracy,
         pinning the magic carpet to the rafters. Kitty and Puss
         tumble toward the factory floor.

         Puss lands hard on a conveyor belt full of pies. He recovers,
         realizing that he HAS THE ENCHANTED MAP in his hand.

                             PUSS
                   Ha! Ha!

                             KITTY
                   What?! Get back here!

         Puss shouts triumphantly as Kitty passes by on another belt.

                             PUSS
                   The best thief has won!

                             KITTY
                       (waving the map)
                   You're right! She did!

         Puss blinks, slow to realize: somehow Kitty has swiped the
         map with amazing cat thief slight-of-hand. Puss never even
         saw the move.

         In his own hand he's now holding--

                             PUSS
                   Huh?

         -- HIS OWN BOOT! Kitty salutes and bounds off.

                                PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Ah! C'mon!

         BACK WITH JACK as the Three Bears BURST from the trophy room
         wall and TRAMPLE HIM. Goldi is riding Mama's back, pointing
         toward the cats.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   There! They're getting away!

         INTERCUTTING ACTION:

         Puss STUMBLES off down the conveyor belt, trying to put on
         his boot, stomping through pie crusts, splattering filling.

         Kitty BATTLES through the factory, dispatching three
         determined bakers. She pulls down the hat over one guy's
         head, knocks another into a vat of pie filling and TEARS THE
         MOUSTACHE off a third.

         Puss observes, wincing in sympathy-- that's gotta hurt.
         Distracted, he allows HIS OWN FACIAL HAIR to get caught the
         conveyor belt's cog.

                             PUSS
                   No, no, no, no!

         Kitty watches his predicament, highly amused.

                             KITTY
                       (running off)
                   Nice catching up with you, Puss!
                   Gotta go.

         Puss manages to free his beard, but the Three Bears are
         closing in. Papa Bear advances on him, snarling.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Here, Kitty, Kitty!

         Instinctively, Puss reaches for his scabbard and draws his
         weapon.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Is that a stick?

         Yep, it's a stick. Puss realizes, smiles weakly.

                             BABY BEAR (CONT'D)
                   Ha! What're you gonna do with a st--

         Puss makes the best of it, delivering a sharp swat to Baby's
         nose!

                                BABY BEAR   (CONT'D)
                   Oww!

         And another to Mama's paw.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Ouch, me knuckles!

         Ana a third to Papa's head.

                             PAPA BEAR
                       (unfazed)
                   You shouldn't-a done that, mate.

         Papa launches Puss into the air with a powerful swipe of his
         arm.
                             PUSS
                   Aaahhhhhhhgh!

         Kitty climbs to a WINDOW overlooking the factory courtyard.
         She's about to make a break for freedom, when she sees Puss
         hurtling through the air, flying right toward her!

                             KITTY
                       (rolling her eyes)
                   This idiot...

         Puss SLAMS into Kitty. The two of them crash through the
         window and plunge toward the courtyard.


         EXT. PIE FACTORY - COURTYARD - NIGHT

         The cats land in the Serpent Sisters WAGON (still parked and
         heaped with bags of gold).

                                PUSS
                   Oof!

         Dog pops up from the driver's seat, holding a sandwich.
                             DOG
                       (munching)
                   Hey Puss, I found a sandwich in
                   here! I think it's tuna fish!

                             PUSS
                       (slapping it away)
                   Drive, Perro!

                                DOG
                   Okie-doke!
2


         Dog snaps the reins, sending the horse into full GALLOP. The
         wagon tears out of the courtyard at high speed.

         Jack's henchmen ride in pursuit.

                             HENCHMAN
                   There they are!


         EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

         The wagon races through the streets, Horner's goons closing
         in on horseback, launching flaming arrows.

         Kitty sits up, lifts up a bag of gold and uses it to block an
         arrow.

                             DOG
                   Oh, cool! Another member of the
                   team!

                             PUSS/KITTY
                   We are not a team!

                             PUSS
                   Eyes on the road!

                             KITTY
                   Who is this guy?

                             DOG
                   I'm Puss' best friend.

                             PUSS
                   No, he isn't!

                             DOG
                   And his therapy dog!

                             PUSS
                   Definitely not!

                             KITTY
                   Finally! You need therapy.

         The wagon CRASHES through merchant stalls in a crowded
         marketplace.

         As they careen through the maze of narrow streets, Puss and
         Kitty renew their TUG-OF-WAR with the map.

                             PUSS
                   Give me the map! Trust me!

                             KITTY
                       (bitterly)
                   Trust you?! Like I did in Santa
                   Coloma?

                             PUSS
                   Really? Santa Coloma?

                             KITTY
                   Si! SANTA COLOMA!

         The wagon speeds from the market-place, bristling with
         flaming arrows. The cats are so busy fighting over the map
         that they barely notice.

                             PUSS
                   Mine!

                             KITTY
                   Mine!

                             PUSS
                       (high-pitched)
                   Miine!

                             KITTY
                       (higher pitched)
                   Mii-iine!

         Their words turn into screeching CAT YOWLS.

         The wagon heads for a NARROW BRIDGE, Horner's thugs still
         following close. Another fusillade of flaming arrows rains
         down, lighting the map on fire. The cats hastily blow it out.

         Puss sees a bag of gold that's been stuck with an arrow.
         Inspired, he kicks it from the back of the wagon. The bag
         breaks open on the ground, SPILLING GOLDEN LOOT everywhere.

         Villagers crowd onto the bridge, grabbing at the gold,
         blocking Horner's henchmen. Puss plays up his Robin Hood
         persona.

                             PUSS
                   Good people! Accept these golden
                   gifts from Puss in Boots!

         The crowd CHEERS. Puss strikes a pose, basking in the
         adoration.

         But then-- Puss hears a familiar WHISTLE. The Wolf appears,
         stalking through the crowd. He places two gold coins on his
         eyes, points a claw at Puss and smiles malevolently.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Speed up! Go, go, go!


         INT. PIE FACTORY - TROPHY ROOM - NIGHT

         Jack's boots crunch over broken glass. He approaches a window
         and scowls off at the retreating wagon.

                             JACK HORNER
                       (to a Henchman)
                   Assemble the Baker's Dozen!

         LOCK-AND-LOAD MONTAGE:

         Jack grabs a Mary Poppins-style satchel: his bottomless MAGIC
         NANNY-BAG.

         He hands a guard an enchanted UMBRELLA.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Careful with this!

         The umbrella lofts the baker skyward.

                             FEMALE GUARD
                   Ahhhhh!

         He gathers up fairy tale weapons from his arsenal and tosses
         them into the bag.

                             JACK HORNER
                   I'll take this! And that! Oh, and
                   these!

         Jack paws through a shelf lined with CRYSTAL BALLS. He grabs
         a bandolier belt loaded with POISON APPLES. He snatches a
         fistful of UNICORN HORNS.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Oh and these. One of those. And I
                   gotta take that! Yes! No! Yesss!!

         Jack grabs the caged PHOENIX and crams it into the bag's
         endless depths. Still more fairy tale objects go in after it.

         Finally, Jack stands before a MAGIC PUMPKIN glowing with
         sinister light. He raises a fairy godmother wand and brings
         it down, shattering the pumpkin. Magical effects flash as the
         pumpkin is transformed into a HEAVILY ARMORED TANK!
5


         EXT. PIE FACTORY - NIGHT

         The factory gates crash open. Jack's Pumpkin Tank speeds PAST
         CAMERA pulled by four HORNLESS UNICORNS. Jack stands at the
         top looking determined. Also onboard, thirteen thuggish
         henchmen armed with deadly kitchen utensils: THE BAKER'S
         DOZEN.

         Jack squints into his crystal ball and sees an image of Puss,
         Kitty and Dog galloping across the landscape. He smiles
         grimly, tracking them.

                             JACK HORNER
                   I'll get you my kitties-- and your
                   little dog, too.


         EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS

         The wagon speeds over rugged terrain. Kitty and Puss break
         the seal of the folded map and open it with anticipation.

         The map is blank.

                             KITTY
                   What? This is blank! We've been
                   ripped off! Where is the--

         Suddenly, words appear, magically drawn in glittering cursive
         script.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Oh yeah, I knew it was going to do
                   that.

                             PUSS
                       (reading)
                   "The Dark Forest is deep and far.
                   Within its bounds you'll find the
                   star "
                             KITTY
                   The Dark forest? No one goes into
                   The Dark Forest.

                             PUSS
                   Or comes out.

         The words on the map change. Kitty reads:

                              KITTY
                   "A single wish burns true and
                   bright. This map's the key, so hold
                   on tight."
6


         Hold on tight. That bit of advice inspires another round of
         tug-of-war. Kitty draws her sword.

                               KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Sueltalo.

         Puss counters, drawing his stick.

                             PUSS
                   YOU let go.

                             KITTY
                   A stick?! What happened to your
                   sword?

                              PUSS
                   Got rid of it. You know, made
                   things too easy. I needed a
                   challenge.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah, you looked pretty challenged
                   back there.

                             PUSS
                   There is no way I'm letting you
                   hold the map.

                             KITTY
                   Well, there's no way I'm letting
                   YOU hold the map!

                             DOG
                   I can hold it.

         Kitty swings her sword, pointing it at Dog. Dog doesn't
         flinch.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah, right! What's your deal
                   anyway? You run with the Chihuahua
                   Gang?

                             DOG
                   I don't think so.

                             KITTY
                   I don't believe you.

                             DOG
                       (brightly)
                   That's okay. As long as you believe
                   in yourself!

                             KITTY
                       (to Puss)
                   What? Is he deranged?

                             PUSS
                   Yup.

                             KITTY
                       (to Dog)
                   What's your name?

                             DOG
                   Oh, I've been called all kinds of
                   things. Dog, Bad Dog, Stupid Dog,
                   Hey You, You There, Get Out, Leave
                   It, Drop It, Big Rat. Small Pig.
                   Rat Face. Butt Nugget, *BLEEP* for
                   Brains...You Know, that sorta
                   thing. But I've never had a name
                   that really stuck. You know, and
                   belonged to ME.

                             PUSS
                   Is he done?

         Dog holds out his paw for a handshake.

                             DOG
                   And you are--?

                             KITTY
                   Softpaws. Kitty Softpaws.

                             DOG
                   Wow. Yeah, now that's a good name.
                   There's music in a name like that:
                   Kit-ty Soft-paws!

         Kitty gives Dog a skeptical look. Then--

                             KITTY
                   Nice try. Classic con. No one's
                   that dumb. No one's that nice. I
                   don't trust you.

                             PUSS
                   Me neither. He cannot be trusted.

                             KITTY
                   BUT! I trust him more than I trust
                   you.

         The wagon charges away from camera, Puss and Kitty still
         staring each other down, not letting go of the map.

                             PUSS
                       (sighs)
                   This trip is going to be fun.


         EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY/NIGHT

         TRAVEL MONTAGE: Various shots of the wagon traveling over
         rugged landscapes. In pursuit, Jack Horner and the fast-
         moving bear clan.

         MONTAGE ENDS as the wagon rolls over a rise in the landscape,
         framed by a storming, ominous sky. Puss, Kitty and Dog climb
         down and look off in awe. They've arrived--


         EXT. THE BORDER OF THE DARK FOREST - DAY

         A SOLID WALL of thorn-studded brambles and twisted trees.
         Hollow trunks resemble tortured faces with gasping mouths.
         It's a fairy tale nightmare come to life.

         Puss and Kitty are still holding onto the map, but they are
         fully focused on the scene before them.

         Rising mist and atmospherics. Puss looks uneasy as fog coils
         around him.

                             PUSS
                   This must be... The Dark Forest!

         Puss reaches out with his stick-sword, extending his arm into
         the wall of trees. The entire spooky tableaux SHIMMERS like a
         pond reflection rippled by a tossed stone. It's all an
         ILLUSION, some kind of magic portal...

         Puss withdraws the stick and to his horror finds that his
         HAND IS MISSING!

                                PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Oh my Gah!
                                KITTY
                   It's gone!

         But POOF! It reappears.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   It's back! Que miedo.

                             PUSS
                       (nervous chuckle)
                   Nothing to worry about.

         The three of them inch forward. Closer, closer...

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   We step through as one. Ready: One,
                   two-- AFTER YOU.

         Puss KICKS the Dog into the forest.

                             DOG
                   Ahhh!

         Thunder CRASHES. The image before them warps and sparkles.
         After a long beat of silence--

                             PUSS
                   Dog? Still alive?
                             KITTY
                   Let's go find out!

         Kitty leaps boldly forward. Puss, holding on to one end of
         the map, has no choice but to enter as well.

                             PUSS
                   Wait!

         Puss SCREAMS, tumbling through a supernatural portal full of
         kaleidoscopic light and energy.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY

         Puss keeps SCREAMING. Then he opens his eyes, blinks, and
         realizes that he's sitting on the forest floor beside Kitty
         and Dog. They're staring off in wonder.

                             PUSS
                   Whoa...

         They've arrived in THE DARK FOREST. It's a place of
         enchantment, full of technicolor trees and rivers that
         sparkle with stardust. Truly magical.

                             KITTY
                   For a dark forest, this place is
                   pretty colorful. I wish I had my
                   quincea�era here.

                              PUSS
                       (standing up)
                   The Wishing Star is in here
                   somewhere.

         Puss dusts himself off, turns to Kitty, forces a smile.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (sweetly)
                   Kitty, may I please see the map?

                             KITTY
                   No.

                             PUSS
                   Seriously? You won't let me hold it
                   for even one minute?

                             KITTY
                   Nope. Not even for one second.

                             PUSS
                   Come on, Kitty. You've got to--
         Puss lowers his head and takes off his hat, a subtle antic.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   ...TRUST ME...

         Puss looks up, launching into his classic CUTE-EYES trick,
         turning its adorable-but-mighty power on Kitty.

                             DOG
                       (noticing)
                   Wait, wait, what's going on with
                   his eyes? They're getting bigger!
                   Oh, Kitty, you gotta trust
                   him...Look at those eyes!

                             KITTY
                   Really? You call that cute?

         Kitty flashes her own CUTE-EYES at Puss. Puss staggers. It's
         a CUTE-EYES stare-off for the ages!

                             DOG
                   Oh! Look at her! Those eyes are
                   even bigger than yours! Do whatever
                   she wants, Puss!

         Puss answers back with even cuter cuteness, fluffing up his
         beard.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Ohhh, wait a second! So poofy!

         Kitty starts making biscuits with her paws.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   No! With the paws! Come on--

         Puss raises his game, striking a charming pose, raising his
         hat to his chest.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (gasps)
                   With the hat? It's ALL... SO...
                   CUTE! Cuteness overload!

         Puss and Kitty stand nose to nose, eyes shimmering. Dog
         staggers, swoons, and finally PASSES OUT, overdosed on
         cuteness.

                             PUSS
                   Can we look at the map now?

         Kitty relents. They roll Dog out of the way and spread the
         map on the ground. Stardust begins to swirl across it,
         inscribing another rhyme.

                             KITTY
                       (reading)
                   "Follow this enchanted chart, it
                   knows your path and knows your
                   heart."

         Glowing AVATARS appear at the top of the map: tiny figures
         representing Puss, Kitty, and Dog.

                             PUSS
                       (points at avatars)
                   Is that us?

         Puss touches the map. When he does, magic dust shimmers and
         sketches out a CUSTOMIZED ROUTE to the Wishing Star.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (reading the map)
                   It says we must go through the
                   Valley of Incineration, over
                   Undertaker Ridge, through the Cave
                   of Lost Souls...
         The forest around them magically readjusts, conforming to the
         map. Rocks, trees and topography shift, revealing a
         FRIGHTENING LANDSCAPE: valleys of fire, avalanche battered
         canyons, mountaintops lanced by lightning bolts...

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (aghast)
                   Really?

                             KITTY
                   Let me take a look.

         Kitty pushes Puss away and places her paw on the map. The map
         sparkles and shows a different path.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                       (reading the map)
                   What? Swamp of Infinite Sorrows.
                   Mountains of Misery, The Abyss of
                   Eternal Loneliness?

         The FOREST SHIFTS once again. A bog of simmering acid rises
         before them. Volcanos appear on the horizon, piping smoke.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   There's something wrong with this
                   map.
                             PUSS
                   I guess there's a different
                   terrible path for everyone.

                             KITTY
                   It's almost like the forest doesn't
                   want anyone to make a wish.

                             DOG
                   I don't even have a wish, but can I
                   try it?

         Dog steps onto the map. Once more, the landscape shifts, this
         time revealing a path that passes beneath a RAINBOW ARCH and
         into FLOWERING MEADOWS. Bird song and butterflies fill the
         air.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Mine says we skip through The
                   Pocket Full O'Posies, and then
                   drift down the River of Relaxation--
                   oh, that sounds fun.

                             KITTY
                   No fair! Why does he get the good
                   ones?

         BACK ON THE MAP as Dog reads:

                              DOG
                   ...Wander the Field Of Quick And
                   Easy Solutions, and arrive at the
                   star. Oh wow! That sounds
                   wonderful!

         Dog steps away.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Oh-- but this is your quest. I
                   don't wanna impose.

         Kitty and Puss push Dog back toward the map.

                             PUSS/KITTY
                   You hold the map.

                             DOG
                   Really?

         Kitty threatens Dog with her sword.

                             KITTY
                   But, don't you cross me-- or your
                   name will be Perro Muerto.

                             DOG
                   Okie-dokey.

         Suddenly, AVATARS representing Goldilocks and the Three Bears
         pop up on the map.

                             PUSS
                   Wait. Is that--?

         High in the sky, a flash of light. Goldi and the bears FALL
         through a magic portal and plunge into the forest canopy,
         SCREAMING.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   It's raining bears, time to go!

         They hurry off.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY
         WITH THE BEARS: Baby is sniffing, still following the scent.
         Goldi rides on Mama's back, "selling" the bears on the quest
         ahead.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Ohhhh, I'm telling ya. When we get
                   that wish it'll make everything
                   JUST RIGHT for all of us.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Will it make us rich? Rich enough
                   to hibernate all year round?

         She leaps over onto Papa's back.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   The richest.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Will we be like big time thieves?

         Goldi leaps onto Baby's back.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   The biggest!

         Baby chuckles with delight.

                             BABY BEAR
                   You know that suit Jack Horner
                   wears?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Yeah?

                             BABY BEAR
                   I'm gonna have one-a them.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Yeah!

                             BABY BEAR
                   Only mine will be purpler. Like,
                   twice as purpler!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   The purplest!

         Papa and Baby bear race ahead, thoroughly motivated.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Noice! Big time thieves, comin'
                   through!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   I'll race ya!

                             BABY BEAR (O.S.)
                   You can't beat me old man!

         Mama lags behind, looking doubtful.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   What kind of wish can do all that,
                   Goldi?
5


                             GOLDILOCKS
                   I can't tell ya. If you say what
                   your wish is, then it don't come
                   true. Sorry-- Birthday Wish Rules.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Oh come on, mother-daughter secret?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Mama. Just drop it, please.

         Mama senses that Goldi's holding something back.

                                MAMA BEAR
                   Oh...okay.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Eh, c'mon. We got some cats to
                   catch.

         Mama and Goldi head off.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - MEADOWS/ POCKET FULL OF POSIES - DAY

         Puss, Kitty and Dog run through a meadow, following Dog's
         easy path. Dog is full of happy energy, plowing through
         flowers and popping up here and there, Whack-A-Mole style.

                             DOG
                   Birthday wish rules? What's that
                   mean?

                             PUSS
                   It means I'm not telling you my
                   wish.

                             KITTY
                   He doesn't want to tell us because
                   it's something stupid. Like
                   conditioner for that thing on his
                   face.

                             PUSS
                   It's distinguished!

                             DOG
                   What about you, Kitty? What are you
                   gonna wish for?

         Puss gives Kitty a look. He'd like to know too.
6


                             KITTY
                   Um-- can't tell you. Birthday Wish
                   Rules. Or whatever.

                             PUSS
                   I bet your wish is something
                   stupid, like-- OOOF!

         A GIANT ROSE bursts from the ground and sends Puss tumbling.
         Kitty LAUGHS, but then ANOTHER GIANT ROSE shoots up,
         launching her skyward.

                             KITTY
                   Ahhhh!

         Puss rolls to a stop, gasping like the wind's been knocked
         out of him. Kitty lands in a stereotypical "scared cat pose".
         Dog calmly stops to smell some flowers.

                             DOG
                   This must be the Pocket Full O'
                   Posies.

         Kitty draws her sword. Puss draws his stick.

                             PUSS
                   Out of the way, demon flowers!

                             KITTY
                   It's pruning time!

         Kitty and Puss start HACKING at the flowers. Every time they
         chop one flower down, two more grow back in its place.

                             KITTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                   Muerta rosa enga�osa!

         Dog sniffs one of the flowers. It nudges Dog forward.

                             DOG
                   Awww, thank you!
         Soon, the cats are overwhelmed, sandwiched close together in
         the middle of a HUGE BOUQUET. Kitty's face is pressed right
         into Puss' beard.

                             KITTY
                   We don't have time for this!

                             PUSS
                   Perro, I thought your path was
                   supposed to be easy!

         Dog admires a giant flower and gives it a SNIFF. It gently
         lifts him up to Puss and Kitty's bouquet.

                             DOG
                   You know, I think all you have to
                   do is stop and smell the roses.

                             KITTY
                   Seriously? Ugh.

         Puss and Kitty sniff half-heartedly.

                             PUSS
                   This is stupid.

                             KITTY
                   All I smell is bull--

                             DOG
                   Shhhh. Watch.

         Dog takes a big whiff of the flowers that are trapping Puss
         and Kitty.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (exhale)
                   Ahhhhh.

         The flowers lower Puss and Kitty to the ground and release
         them.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Don't rush through it. Take your
                   time and really appreciate what's
                   right in front of you.

         Dog walks ahead, sniffing, flowers parting before him as he
         proceeds.

                               DOG (CONT'D)
                   Gracias.
         Puss and Kitty trudge along behind him.

                             KITTY
                   Ugh, his path is so corny.

                             PUSS
                   And cheesy.

                               KITTY
                   And lame.

                             PUSS
                   And weird, like him.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah. Why are you so ridiculous,
                   Dog? What's your story?

                             DOG
                   My story? Oh! It's actually a very
                   funny story!

         Dog struggles to keep a straight face. He knows this one's
         gonna kill.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Back when I was a pup, me and my
                   littermates lived with a family. A
                   family full of pranksters who liked
                   to play hide-and-seek. And I was
                   always IT. Pick on the little guy,
                   am I right?

         Dog starts cracking up, barely getting it out.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   They tried putting me in a packing
                   crate, a dumpster... no matter how
                   hard they tried, I'd ALWAYS find
                   them.

         Puss and Kitty exchange a glance. This story doesn't seem
         very funny.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   So one day, they get creative and
                   they put me in a sock-- with a rock
                   in it! And then they throw me in a
                   river!

         Dog snorts with laughter.
                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   I gnawed a hole in the sock and I
                   swam to the surface! Never found
                   them or my littermates, so-- I
                   guess I'm still it! Ha, ha, ha!

                             KITTY
                   Wow. That is the saddest funny
                   story I've ever heard.

                             DOG
                   Well, joke's on them. That sock
                   they put me in? I grew into it!

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   So I got a great story and a free
                   sweater out of it. Win-win!

                             KITTY
                   Dude, you didn't win! You of all
                   people should have a wish!

                             DOG
                   I already have a comfy sweater and
                   two best friends. I've got
                   everything I could wish for-- no
                   magic required.

         Puss and Kitty take that in-- then shrug and start sniffing
         flowers. WIDE as FLOWERS PART to reveal a clear path forward.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (big sniff)
                   Oh, lovely.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - MEADOWS - DAY

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears travel through the meadow that
         the cats and Dog passed through earlier.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oh, we're getting really close! I
                   can smell two cats, a dog, and--
                       (sniff-sniff)
                   -- pie?

         The bears look over their shoulders. A massive dust cloud is
         rising into the sky. It's Jack Horner's tank, barreling
         toward them.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Well, if it isn't the idiots who
                   tried to steal from me!

                             BABY BEAR
                       (proudly)
                   Hey, he remembers us!

         Jack reaches into his nanny-bag and attempts to draw a sword
         from it. He yanks on the hilt but the sword is stuck.

                              JACK HORNER
                       (pulling)
                   Behold, Excalib-- Excalib--
                   Excalibur!

         With a mighty effort, Jack pulls out the fabled SWORD IN THE
         STONE-- its blade still sunk in a heavy boulder.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Yeah, I couldn't get this rock off
                   of it, but it's still pretty cool,
                   right?

                             MAMA BEAR
                   He's gaining on us!

         The tank draws up alongside of the bears. Jack holds the
         sword like a baseball bat, lining up his shot.

                             JACK HORNER
                       (muttering)
                   Ok-- a little left. That's it!

                                GOLDILOCKS
                   Go faster!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   He's up my back door!

         Jack takes a massive swing, clubbing Goldi and the bears off
         the path. SLO-MO: Mama cradles Goldi, protecting her as they
         tumble down a rocky slope.

                             MAMA BEAR
                       (slo-mo voice)
                   Goldi!

         Jack continues on, laughing maniacally.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - POCKET FULL O' POSIES - DAY

         The pumpkin tank grinds ahead, mowing through flowers,
         closing in on the Pocket Full O' Posies. Suddenly, GIGANTIC
         ROSES shoot from the earth, blocking the way. The tank
         shudders to a stop.

         Jack, frustrated, barks orders.
                             JACK HORNER
                   Well? Start chopping!

                             BAKER #12
                   On it! You don't have to tell me
                   twice.

         The bakers leap to the forest floor and start HACKING away at
         the flowers with their razor-sharp kitchen utensils.

         Unnoticed, GIANT ROSES turn toward the intruders, looking
         menacing. Other flowers slink up like lions stalking prey
         through the tall grass.

                             BAKER #12 (CONT'D)
                       (wielding a cleaver)
                   I'm gonna chop the heck outta this
                   ficus-lyrata-

         Suddenly, Baker Number Twelve is gobbled up by a giant
         CARNIVEROUS ROSE. It CHOMPS, chews, spits out bones.

                                BAKER #4
                   Jerry! No!

         It spits out the baker's CLEAVER too. The blade sinks into
         the tank RIGHT NEXT TO JACK'S HEAD!

         Chaos and SCREAMS as murderous flowers attack the crew.
                             BAKER #8
                   Avenge me Jack! Die! Die! Die!

                                JACK HORNER
                   Nope!

         Jack grabs his nanny-bag and takes cover on the side of the
         tank.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Time to bring out the big guns!

         Jack reaches deep into the bag. He withdraws a SPINNING
         WHEEL, throws it aside. Next, a LIVING BROOM with little
         waving arms. He tosses it away.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                       (searching)
                   Guess I overpacked.

         Back to digging through the bag. He pulls out a tiny bottle
         labeled DRINK ME and a cookie with a tag that reads, EAT ME.

                              JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Ooh, magic snacks. Save those for
                   later.
                       (then)
                   Ah, pay-dirt!

         Jack pulls out a jar containing some sort of WINGED INSECT. A
         magic glow bathes Jack's face as he unscrews the lid and
         empties the jar into his open palm.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Alright Magical Locust. Defoliate!
                   Fly and feast! Eat those flowers!

         The insect looks up at Jack, blinking. This is ETHICAL BUG, a
         copyright-free cricket with kind eyes and a charming stammer.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   I'm not a magic locust. Why, I'm
                   not a locust at all.

                             JACK HORNER
                   What are you, then? Some sort of
                   demon grasshopper? A deadly fairy?
                   Put a spell on the forest, then.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   I don't cast spells.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Well, what DO you do?

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   I-- I judge you. I sit on your
                   shoulder and judge your actions and
                   the quality of your character.
                       (jumps on Jack's shoulder)
                   I'm your conscience!

                             JACK HORNER
                   I really did overpack.

         The SCREAMS and mayhem continue. Jack starts digging through
         the nanny-bag again. A baker grabs onto the tank, holding on
         for dear life as a GIANT FLOWER tries to pull him away.

                             BAKER #5
                   Help me, Jack! Help!

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?
                   You're losing a lot of men!

                             JACK HORNER
                       (conspiratorially)
                   I'm not really stressing about the
                   manpower. I've got a bottomless bag
                   of magic weapons. These babies are
                   gonna get me that wish even after
                   this whole team is dead and gone.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Now, now, Jack as your conscience -

         Jack withdraws the PHOENIX from the bag. Ethical Bug looks
         seriously impressed.

                             ETHICAL BUG (CONT'D)
                       (gasps)
                   Oh, my word! It's the noble
                   PHOENIX. She's a symbol of rebirth
                   and the eternal circle of--

         FWOOOSH! Jack violently stretches the neck of the Phoenix,
         takes aim, and SHOOTS it like a flamethrower. The forest
         ignites!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

                   I really have my work cut out for
                   me on this one...
         Jack sprays fire everywhere. Some of his own men are caught
         in the blaze!

                               BAKERS
                   Ahhhhhhh!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Don't be near where I'm flame-
                   throwing!


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - RIVER - DAY

         On what seems to be a starry night sky-- until the image
         begins to ripple and a hollow log floats into frame.

         We're actually looking at a HIGH ANGLE on a river brewing
         with motes of stardust. Puss, Kitty, and Dog are drifting on
         it, using the hollow log as a boat.

         Puss is staring down at - but not touching - the map, which
         lays open on the deck.

         CLOSE ON THE MAP: The Avatars of Dog and the cats are getting
         closer to the star. Jack Horner's avatar is stuck in the
         POCKET FULL OF POSIES location, not moving.

                             PUSS
                   Do your job, demon flowers...

         Puss' eyes shift to the star on the map.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                       (sotto)
                   Soon...

         Puss scratches his beard. It's itchy. VERY itchy.

         At the other end of the log, Dog makes EFFORT NOISES,
         struggling to master the CUTE EYES trick.

                             DOG
                   Okay Kitty, I think I've got it
                   now.

         Dog turns his face to Kitty. It's hideous. Big veiny eyes, a
         strained smile.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Trust... meeee.....

                             KITTY
                   Easy, easy, you're going to give
                   yourself a hernia. Here, one more
                   time. Like this.

         Kitty demonstrates, fixing Dog with her hypnotic cute-eye
         gaze.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   ... TRUST ME...

                             DOG
                       (melting)
                   Awwwww!
                       (shakes it off)
                   But of course, I trust you and
                   Puss, even without the eyes.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah? Big mistake.

                             DOG
                   Whaddya mean? You're my friends.

                             KITTY
                   You know what trust gets you? A
                   sock, a rock, and a swim in the
                   river.
                             DOG
                   But-- you have to trust SOMEBODY,
                   right?

                             KITTY
                   Not me. Whenever I've let my guard
                   down I`ve been double-crossed,
                   declawed, played and betrayed.

         Kitty shoots a bitter glance toward Puss.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Never again. I'm a solo act.
                   I keep my secrets and I play my
                   cards close. That's how you get a
                   winning hand.

         Kitty puts her paw on Dog's shoulder.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Take it from me. Never trust
                   anyone.

         Kitty holds up Dog's sweater-vest, expertly swiped with her
         cat thief skills. Dog double-takes. He never even saw her
         make the move. Kitty tosses it back to him.
                             DOG
                   What? Wait that's amazing! Oh,
                   you're good.

         Meanwhile, Puss continues to scratch his beard. It's making
         him nuts! He approaches Kitty.

                             PUSS
                   Kitty, I've been thinking...

                             KITTY
                   Thinking about what?

                              PUSS
                   My beautiful beard. It's very
                   distinguished, yes, but it does
                   deprive the world a good look at--
                        (with reverence)
                   THE FACE. So, if it will make you
                   happy, I could be convinced
                   to--

                             KITTY
                   I've gotten used to it.
                             PUSS
                   Wait, what?

                             KITTY
                   The beard. Keep it.

                             PUSS
                   Ah, well, um, you see--
                       (breaking down)
                   Kitty please! Get this itchy thing
                   off me! It's like a fever on my
                   face!

         He launches into another round of frenzied scratching.

                             KITTY
                   Hold on, is the great Puss in Boots
                   asking for help?

                             PUSS
                   S�, help! You were right, the beard
                   is disgusting.

                             KITTY
                   And?

                             PUSS
                   And it's like a possum crawled on
                   my face.

                             KITTY
                   And?

                             PUSS
                   And died of shame.

         SCHHI-ING! Kitty draws a TINY ANKLE KNIFE from her boot.

                             KITTY
                   Okay, okay, possum face.
                   I won't make you beg.


         EXT. DARK FOREST - STREAM - MOMENTS LATER

         Kitty is standing behind Puss, shaving his beard-- none too
         gently.

                             PUSS
                   Hey! Slow down. Ow! Go with the
                   grain! You gotta go with the grain!

                             KITTY
                   I know what I'm doing. I'm a master
                   of the blade.
                       (winks)
                   Right, perrito?

         Dog laughs. Puss' beard is cut into a silly shape.

                             PUSS
                   What. What's funny? Nothing should
                   be funny.

                             KITTY
                   Shh. �C�llate!

         TIME CUT: Kitty is finishing the job properly, trimming
         around Puss' throat. Their eyes connect, an intimate moment.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   There's the handsome face I
                   remember. The face I haven't seen
                   since--

         She gives Puss a little nick. Deliberately.

                             PUSS
                   Ai!

                             KITTY
                   --Santa Coloma.
                             DOG
                   Ahh, yes! Santa Coloma!

                             KITTY
                   You had that coming.

          Kitty hands the tiny ankle knife to Puss.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Here. You can have my gatito blade.

                             PUSS
                   Um-- Thank you?

                             KITTY
                   Better than a stick.

         True enough. Puss slips the knife into his belt and CHUCKS
         the stick toward the shore.

                             PUSS
                   Vaya con Dios, stick-sword.

         Dog ZEROES IN on the flying stick. It's irresistible. It's
         instinct. He's got to have it! Dog BOUNDS ONTO THE SHORE,
         chasing it. He charges into a wall of foliage and disappears.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Perro, what are you doing!?


         EXT. DARK FOREST - CONTINUOUS

         Puss and Kitty step onto shore, calling after Dog.

                             PUSS
                       (calling out)
                   Perro! Where did that crazy dog go?

                             KITTY
                   I think you like him.

                             PUSS
                   No, no I don't.

                             KITTY
                   I think you're ready to name him.

                             PUSS
                   No, I just need his easy path to
                   get my wish.

                             KITTY
                   You mean my wish.

                             JACK HORNER (O.S.)
                   You mean MY WISH!

         Jack Horner's tank PLOWS through the tree line. Horner's
         standing on top with Dog in his grasp and Ethical Bug on his
         shoulder. Dog has the stick in his mouth.

                             DOG
                       (stick in mouth)
                   Sorry!

         The Baker's Dozen jump off from the tank, brandishing weapons
         and looking scary as hell.

                             BAKER #6
                       (psychotic)
                   Hahahahahahahahahah.

                             BAKER #7
                       (bestial)
                    Grrrrrrrrr.

         Puss clutches the map, terrified. Kitty draws her sword.

                             PUSS
                   The Baker's Dozen.

                             KITTY
                       (re: Dog)
                   Let him go!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Oh, I don't know, I might keep him.
                       (to Dog)
                   Would you like a treat?

         Jack reaches into his nanny bag, searching.

                             KITTY
                   Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

                             JACK HORNER
                   It's not a granny bag. It is a
                   magic nanny-bag.

         Jack pulls out a crossbow loaded with a unicorn horn. He
         points it squarely at Dog.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Now: make with the map, or we'll
                   see what a unicorn horn really
                   does.

                              ETHICAL BUG
                       (gasp)
                   You're not going to shoot a puppy
                   are you Jack?

                             JACK HORNER
                   Yeah, in the face. Why?

                               BAKER #13 (O.S.)
                   Ahhhhh!

         WHAM! A baker flies in from nowhere and slams into the side
         of Jack's tank.

                               JACK HORNER
                   What the!

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears appear, looking thrashed,
         trashed and thoroughly pissed. Baby holds another struggling
         baker above his head.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Give us the map, or the baker-man
                   gets it!

                               BABY BEAR
                   Yeah!

                             JACK HORNER
                   I don't even have the map, Little
                   Bo Creep.

         Baby chucks the baker. He SLAMS into the side of the tank.
         Jack is jolted by the impact, dropping Dog.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Stop throwing my men at me!

         Dog makes a break for it, scampering across the forest floor.
         Jack's henchmen lunge for him.

         Baby Bear points at Puss in Boots from the top of the canyon.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Puss in Boots has the map!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Let's get him!

         Goldi and the Bears charge toward Puss! The Baker's Dozen
         spring into action as well! The battle is joined!

                             KITTY
                       (to Puss)
                   I've got a plan. First one to the
                   dog gets the wish.

         Kitty charges right into the fray, letting lose with a full-
         throated WAR CRY. She's in her element. Puss, decidedly, is
         NOT. He stands there, blinking...

                             PUSS
                   What? Ah come on!

         BACK AND FORTH ACTION as Kitty, Goldi and the bears brawl
         with the bakers.

         Jack raises his crossbow and draws a bead on Puss.

                             JACK HORNER
                       (mutters)
                   Steady...

         TELESCOPIC SNIPER VIEW: Puss in the crossbow's sights.

         Jack fires, but a CLUMSY BAKER jumps in the way at the last
         moment. The unicorn horn sticks him right in the butt and he
         EXPLODES into a cloud of magic glitter. Jack LAUGHS!

                             PUSS
                   What?

                             JACK HORNER
                   So that's what it does. Cool!

                             ETHICAL BUG
                       (judgey)
                   No! Not cool!

         Jack lines up another shot. This time he's careful, slowly
         squeezing the trigger and-- MISSING AGAIN. He hits ANOTHER
         one of his bakers.

                             BAKER #11
                   Ah you shot me J--

         Another glittering explosion!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Ah, the sight's off!

         Puss staggers as glitter rains down. Another baker seizes
         Puss and lifts him into the air.

                             BAKER #7
                   I got him, Mister Horner!

         Thunk! That guy gets hit with a unicorn horn, too.

                                JACK HORNER
                   My bad.

                                PUSS
                   Oh no.

         Baker Number SEVEN EXPLODES. The concussive blast knocks Puss
         into the air. The map flies out of his grip. Everything
         lapses into dreamlike SLO-MO as Puss struggles to his feet,
         dazed, a high-pitched RINGING in his ears.

         The ringing sound resolves into a haunting WHISTLE as Puss
         turns to see the WOLF, standing on the river's far bank.

         The Wolf locks eyes with Puss and draws his sickles. Puss'
         fur stands on end. The beat of his heart drumming on the
         soundtrack, accelerating as--

         HE PANICS, turns, runs away. Dog notices and runs after him.

                                DOG
                   Puss wait!

                                KITTY
                   Perro?

         Suddenly, Goldi charges in, riding Papa Bear. She KNOCKS    the
         distracted KITTY DOWN with a blow from her staff.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Thanks for the map, Softpaws!

         Goldi snatches the map from the forest floor and lets out a
         triumphant BEAR-LIKE ROAR.

         The forest SHIFTS once more, adjusting from Dog's path to
         Goldi's. Kitty, Jack Horner, and the bears are separated from
         each other, standing on separate prongs of land.

                             JACK HORNER
                   No, no, no!

                              KITTY
                   No!

         Kitty watches as Goldilocks and the Bears disappear into the
         distance with the prize.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oi! You've just been crimed by The
                   Three Bears Crime Family!

                              MAMA BEAR
                   Oh yeah!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   So long, ya plonkers!


         Kitty turns around looking for Puss and Dog.

                             KITTY
                   Voy a hacer alfombras de ba�o de
                   todos ustedes!
                       (exploding)
                   Puss! Where are you?!


         EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

         WITH PUSS: he's running, taking big, desperate gulps of air,
         the sound of his heartbeat still thumping on the soundtrack.

         WITH DOG: in pursuit. The forest is dense, full of shadows
         and creepy vibes, but he keeps moving, clearing a screen of
         foliage and seeing--

                             DOG
                   Puss? Puss?

         PUSS, sprawled upon the forest floor, wild eyed, breathing
         hard. He's having a full-on PANIC ATTACK. Dog runs to his
         side.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Puss! Puss, what's wrong?

         But Puss can't answer. Instinctively, Dog lies down beside
         him.

         Dog rests his head on Puss' chest, just like a real-world
         therapy dog.

         Puss begins to pet Dog's head. It does seem to help. Puss
         begins to breathe more easily, continuing to pet Dog until
         the moment of panic passes.

                             PUSS
                   Thank you, perrito.

                             DOG
                   What's going on with you, Puss?

                             PUSS
                   I am down to my last life. And I am
                   afraid.

                             DOG
                   Well-- it's okay to be afraid.

                             PUSS
                   No! Not for Puss in Boots. I am
                   supposed to be a fearless hero, a
                   legend-- but without lives to
                   spare, I am nothing.

         Puss sits up, casting a wary eye around the forest.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   I need that wish to get my lives
                   back.

                             DOG
                   You should tell Kitty, she would
                   understand.

                             PUSS
                   No. She cannot hear of this.

         Meanwhile, Kitty is pushing her way through the forest, good
         and mad.

                             KITTY
                   �Ad�nde fueron ese idiota y su
                   perro?

         She sees Puss and Dog and is about to call out, when she
         overhears:

                             PUSS
                   Kitty will never trust me again.
                   Not after Santa Coloma.

                             DOG
                   But that's just one bad heist-

                             PUSS
                   Santa Coloma wasn't a heist,
                   perrito. It was a church...

         FLASHBACK VIGNETTE:

         Puss stands on a hill overlooking a RUSTIC SPANISH CHURCH.

                             PUSS (V.O.)
                   With a priest... and guests... and
                   Kitty. Everything but me. I ran
                   away then, too.

         Church bells ring as Puss exits the scene.

         END FLASHBACK

                                DOG
                   Oh.
                          (it sinks in)
                   Ohh.
                       (it truly sinks in)
                   Ohhh! You left her at the altar?

                             PUSS
                   It was wrong, I know.

         Kitty, still keeping her distance, looks on from the forest.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   I am ashamed. I just wish I hadn't
                   hurt her so badly.
                       (sighs)
                   I regret that day...

                             DOG
                   So maybe you should tell that to
                   Kitty. Might make you feel better.
                   Might make her feel better too...

         Kitty looks moved. She withdraws into the forest and then
         makes a big show of stepping back out, making lots of noise.

                             KITTY
                   Puss? Dog? Oh, there you two are!
                   What happened back there?

                             PUSS
                   Kitty...I lost the map. I messed
                   up.

                             KITTY
                       (waving it off)
                   We'll get it back. We've been in
                   worse pickles.

                             PUSS
                   Who told you that name?!

                                KITTY
                   What name?

                             PUSS
                   Oh-- um-- nothing.
                       (recovering)
                   The bears! We have to find them
                   before they find the star!


         EXT. DARK FOREST - MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

         CLOSE ON THE MAP: THE WISHING STAR in the center, pulsing
         with ethereal light.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                       (excited)
                   Oh, we are SO CLOSE!

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears are making good time. Goldi is
         leading the way, reading the map. Papa and Baby Bear jog
         behind her, happy and upbeat.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   It's finally happening.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   I can taste that wish now. And you
                   know what it tastes like?

                                BABY BEAR
                   Pies?
                                PAPA BEAR
                   Pies!

                             PAPA BEAR / BABY BEAR
                       (singing)
                   Who ate all the pies?!

         Goldi joins in, singing along.

                             BABY BEAR/PAPA BEAR/GOLDI
                       (singing)
                   Who ate all the pies?
                             (MORE)

                             BABY BEAR/PAPA BEAR/GOLDI (CONT'D)
                   We did, we did, we did, we did, we
                   ate all the pies!

         The Bears push into a forest clearing, still chattering.
         Goldi LAUGHS and opens the map again.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oh! It's gonna be wicked.

                              PAPA BEAR
                   Yeah! Imagine us: a BIG TIME crime
                   syndicate!

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Not a big time crime syndicate,
                   love. A big time crime FAMILY.
                   Isn't that right, Goldi?
                       (no answer)
                   Goldi?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   What--

         Suddenly, the images on the map begin to shift. The stardust
         churns and vibrates.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Hey! Look, the map's going all
                   fizzly!

         The stardust vacuums into nothingness. The map is blank!

                             BABY BEAR
                   What'd you do?! Give it me!

         Baby snatches the map from Goldi.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Hey!

         She immediately pounces on him, attacking like a wild thing.
         She pins Baby to the ground, leaning into him with her staff.

                             BABY BEAR
                   No, no, no, no. Ah! Goldi! No
                   biting! Ow!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You're the smash, I'm the grab. I
                   hold the map, you got it?

                             BABY BEAR
                       (squealing)
                   Okay!

         Goldilocks grabs the map back. Another rhyme appears.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                       (reading)
                   "To find your wish, adjust your
                   view. What you seek may be right in
                   front of you." Well that's a load
                   of rubbish. What's that supposed to
                   mean?

         Baby points. Trees part, revealing A WINTER SNOWSCAPE. Smoke
         rises from the chimney of a classic FAIRY-TALE COTTAGE. The
         bears are delighted.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Right in front of us...

                             MAMA BEAR
                   It looks like our cabin back home!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You really think our cabin is in
                   the middle of The Dark Forest?

         Papa holds up a warning paw.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Baby, give it the old sniff test.

         Baby Bear SNIFFS the air, suspicious and hyper-alert. Then--

                             BABY BEAR
                   Something's cooking.

         Papa and Baby look at each other.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Oh, ho, ho, ho!

         They run off towards the cabin.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   No!


         INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

                             GOLDILOCKS (O.S.)
                   Don't open that door!

         Wham! The bears open the door and enter, smiling broadly.

                             BABY BEAR
                   We are home! Hello, door.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Oh, don't go inside...

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Maybe just a quick pop in.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Hello chairs!

         It's rustic and super cozy: overstuffed chairs, comfortable
         looking beds, a fire in the hearth. On a rough-hewn table,
         bowls of porridge have been left to cool.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   What say we hibernate?

          Baby sniffs out a cabinet full of HONEY JARS.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Hello, Honey!

         There is something dreamlike about this place... something
         hypnotic, bewitching. Temptations: Papa sinks into a comfy
         reclining chair.

                              PAPA BEAR
                   Hello my old friend. I have missed
                   you so....

         He trails off and starts SNORING. Mama sniffs porridge on the
         table.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Look, Goldi! Porridge!
                       (sniff, sniff)
                   And it's made just the way you like
                   it.

         Baby Bear is sitting at the table... eating honey... getting
         sleepy...

                             BABY BEAR
                   No matter how you make it, she
                   doesn't like it.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Stop it, all of you.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Maybe our wishes have been granted.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Just stop! It's not our wish
                   granted, it's an obstacle. It's the
                   forest playing tricks!

         Baby Bear BABBLES himself to sleep, spilling honey
         everywhere.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   This isn't real. None of this is--

         Goldilocks spots a children's book on the table: A COLLECTION
         OF FAIRYTALES. Goldi reaches for the book and opens it.
         There's a bookplate pasted on the inner cover: Property of
         the CRYING TEARS ORPHANAGE.
                             MAMA BEAR
                       (noticing)
                   Aw, that was your favorite book.
                   You used to stare at it for hours.

         A frontispiece engraving shows an idealized fairy tale
         family: two human parents and a little girl standing by a
         castle. The engraving of the little girl has Goldi's
         distinctive braids drawn upon it in crayon.

         Goldi turns the page. More engravings of happy family scenes.
         Scribbled in the margins, a child's drawings of Goldilocks
         and the upright fairy-tale family.

         A little girl is HUMMING from O.S.

         Goldilocks looks up to see a shimmering vision of herself as
         a child (LITTLE GOLDI), sitting at the table, looking at the
         book.

         Little Goldi carries away a stardust version of the book.
         Goldilocks follows her, LEAVING THE MAP BEHIND on the table.
         She watches as the glowing figure jumps onto one of three
         beds.
                               LITTLE GOLDI
                   Too hard.

         Little Goldi leaps to the next bed. She's swallowed up in the
         mattress.

                             LITTLE GOLDI (CONT'D)
                   Oof. Too soft.

         Little Goldi climbs into the third bed, snuggles up with her
         book and falls asleep.

                             LITTLE GOLDI (CONT'D)
                   Just right.

         Mama Bear comes up behind Goldilocks as she watches this
         incarnation of the past.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   This was it.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   What was it, Mama?

                             MAMA BEAR
                   The day a little orphan girl broke
                   into our cabin and stole our
                   hearts. The day when our world
                   became just right.

         ON GOLDI as Mama's words land.


         EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

         Dog is staring up into a tree. Puss and Kitty have climbed to
         an astonishing height, vanishing into the forest canopy.

                             DOG
                       (calling up)
                   How's it going? Can you see
                   anything up there?

         WITH PUSS AND KITTY, ascending. They're using branches like
         the rungs of a ladder-- an extremely tall and terrifying
         ladder.

                             PUSS
                       (calling down)
                   Not yet, Perrit--

         Puss SLIPS.
                               PUSS (CONT'D)
                   --OH!

         Puss holds desperately onto a branch, swinging over a
         terrible drop.

                               KITTY
                   You okay?

                             PUSS
                       (covering)
                   S�, I am good... so good.

         The branch BREAKS! Puss falls, but Kitty makes a lightning
         fast move and grabs him by the hand.

                             KITTY
                   If you wanted to hold my hand, all
                   you had to is ask.

         Puss hangs there. Kitty's not pulling him up.

                             PUSS
                   Um... just... feel free to pull me
                   up whenever you get a chance.

                             KITTY
                   I was just remembering the last
                   time I offered you my hand. Only,
                   that time I believe you had cold
                   feet.

         Puss smiles weakly. Kitty finally pulls him back up and turns
         her attention back to the climb.

                             PUSS
                   Kitty, about that day... Puss in
                   Boots is not supposed to be afraid,
                   but outside that church in Santa
                   Coloma-- that was the first time I
                   ever felt fear. So I ran.

         Puss struggles with this confession, but continues.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   It was a mistake, Kitty.

         The two cats stand there looking at each other. They've
         dropped the swagger and the moment is real.

                                KITTY
                   It's okay.

                             PUSS
                   No, no-- it was cowardly.

                                KITTY
                   It's okay.

                             PUSS
                   You alone at the altar...

                                KITTY
                   Puss--

                             PUSS
                   In your beautiful, poofy wedding
                   dress.

                             KITTY
                   Puss, it's okay. I didn't show up
                   either.

                             PUSS
                   Wait, what?

         Kitty climbs off. Puss scrambles up after her.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   What do you mean you didn't show
                   up?
                             KITTY
                   Well, I knew I could never compete
                   with your one true love.

                             PUSS
                   Who?

                             KITTY
                   Yourself! "The legend".

                             PUSS
                   Oh.

                             KITTY
                   I wasn't going to show up for that
                   guy.

         Kitty lifts the brim of Puss' hat and looks in his eyes.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   But, you don't seem like that guy
                   anymore.

         Kitty playfully yanks Puss' hat down over his face and climbs
         off. Puss is left behind on the branch to work it out.

                             DOG (O.S.)
                   Everything okay up there?

         Puss looks down. They've climbed so high that Dog is just a
         tiny black dot, far below.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   I'm giving you a Thumbs-Up, just so
                   you know.

         WITH KITTY near the top of the tree. She's staring off as
         Puss clambers up to join her. Kitty points into the distance.

                             KITTY
                   Puss. Look.

         Magical snow flurries and chimney smoke rise from a distant
         tree line.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY

         Jack Horner is on foot, gazing into his CRYSTAL BALL;
         reflected in it, an image of Puss and Kitty in the tree.
         Ethical Bug is perched on Jack's shoulder.

                             JACK HORNER
                   What do you think, bug? Do I wait
                   for the cats to steal the map and
                   then kill them? Or do I just kill
                   everybody all at once?

         Ethical Bug is appalled.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   You know, I'm starting to think you
                   don't appreciate the value of a
                   life.

                             JACK HORNER
                   What? No! I mean, I love THESE
                   guys.

         REVEAL: Jack's remaining bakers have formed a HUMAN BRIDGE
         across a deep canyon. Jack is treading on their backs, making
         his way across.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Flex those glutes! I need a solid
                   surface!
                             ETHICAL BUG
                       (sotto, to himself)
                   There's good in all people...
                   there's good in all people...
                       (to Jack)
                   You know, Jack, maybe we need to
                   dig a little deeper. Tell me about
                   your childhood.

         Jack SIGHS and looks thoughtful.

                             JACK HORNER
                   You know I never had much as a kid.
                   Just loving parents, stability, a
                   mansion and a thriving baked goods
                   enterprise for me to inherit... you
                   know, useless crap like that.

         Ethical Bug face palms.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   But, once I get my wish, I'll
                   finally have the one thing that
                   will make me happy.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Oh, well what's that?
                             JACK HORNER
                   All of the magic in the world. For
                   me. And no one else gets any. Is
                   that so much?

         Jack holds up the crystal ball for Ethical Bug to see.
         Inside, we see an image of Jack standing on top of the world,
         LAUGHING maniacally as all of the magic flows into him.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Yes!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Agree to disagree.

         Jack reaches solid ground. He turns, looks back to the far
         side of the canyon and gestures.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Alright! Bring it over!

         The unicorns draw JACK'S TANK over the human bridge. The
         bakers groan as it rolls over their backs.
         The unicorns reach the edge of the canyon, but Jack's men can
         no longer bear the tank's terrible weight. The human bridge
         COLLAPSES! The tank and the unfortunate bakers plunge into
         the deep divide.

         Jack and Ethical Bug watch as the tank EXPLODES on the canyon
         floor. A single, surviving baker holds onto the cliff edge
         for dear life.

                             BAKER #2
                   Help?

                              ETHICAL BUG
                    Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

                              JACK HORNER
                    Well, you know what they say: Can't
                    bake a pie without losing a dozen
                    men.

         Jack chuckles. Ethical Bug finally loses it.

                              ETHICAL BUG
                    That was horrible! Your wish is
                    horrible. YOU'RE horrible! You're--
                    you're an irredeemable monster!

                              JACK HORNER
                        (mocking)
                    Wha-wha-what took you so long?
                    Idiot.

         Annoyed, Jack Horner flicks Ethical Bug off his shoulder.
         Ethical Bug SCREAMS, falling into the chasm.

                                 ETHICAL BUG
                    Ohhhhhhhh!

         Jack turns his attention to his last surviving baker. She's
         clinging to the edge of the cliff, hanging on for dear life.

                              JACK HORNER
                    You're not chatty are you?

                              BAKER #2
                        (shaking her head)
                    Uh uh.


         EXT.   BEAR COTTAGE - DAY

         The cats and Dog approach the cottage warily, like commandos
         on a mission behind the lines.

                              KITTY
                        (to Puss)
                    Okay, you take the window, I'll
                    take the chimney.

                              DOG
                    What do I take?

                              PUSS
                    You take it easy, Perrito. We need
                    you to stay here and, um...

                             KITTY
                   And guard our rear.

                             PUSS
                   Yeah, yeah!

                             DOG
                   On your six! Got your rears
                   eyeballed and covered! Hands in,
                   crew!

         DOWN SHOT: three paws overlap.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Ready-- Go TEAM FRIENDSHIP!
                             PUSS
                       (hating it)
                   Team Friendship? I did not agree to
                   this.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah. Do better. Try harder.

                             DOG
                   Well, just a placeholder name, you
                   know. I'll workshop it, okay? Go
                   get `em, tiger!

         Dog SLAPS Puss' butt like a motivating coach.

                             PUSS
                   Hey! Take it easy!

         Dog keeps workshopping team names as Puss and Kitty spring
         into action.

         ON THE MOVE, approaching the cottage:

                             KITTY
                   Ready to get our wish back?
                               PUSS
                   Our wish?

                             KITTY
                   Well, I've been thinking. Maybe--
                   if you play your cards right-- we
                   could share the wish.

         Kitty leaps off, leaving Puss behind, conflicted.

                             PUSS
                   Share the wish...

         INT. COTTAGE - DAY

         Baby's SNORING, his head resting on the table beside the map.
         Mama and Goldilocks are still looking at glowing visions of
         the past.

         IN THE BACKGROUND: Puss and Kitty infiltrate the cottage,
         executing stealthy, acrobatic moves, keeping it quiet.

         Puss leaps onto a hanging lamp and swings, unnoticed. Beneath
         him: the table, Baby, and the MAP.

         PUSS DROPS onto the table. High tension as Puss tip-toes
         through spilled honey and SNATCHES THE MAP.

         The CREAK of the swinging lamp gets Goldi's attention. She
         turns and notices--

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   It's gone! Wake up! Someone's
                   nicked the map!

         Papa wakes, startled.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   What's all this-- what's all this
                   bother about?!

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Oi! Did you not hear her?! THE MAP
                   IS MISSING!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Somebody took it!

         Goldi KICKS over a chair, revealing Puss clinging to the
         bottom of the seat, holding the map.

                              PUSS
                   Hola...

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oi! You criming us when we just
                   crimed you? No crime-backs!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You're dead cat meat.

                             PUSS
                   Okay, okay, okay. It's all...
                   YOURS!

         Puss tosses the map high into the air. It's grabbed by Kitty,
         who's standing on a shelf full of bric-a-brac and keepsakes.

         The bears close in on her, snarling. Kitty leaps to a higher
         perch.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

                             KITTY
                   Really? Let's see what the map has
                   to say...

         Kitty opens the map and stares at it deliberately, intensely.
         A RUMBLING SOUND fills the air as the map's imagery changes
         and the forest outside responds in kind.

         Baby notices pots of honey floating past in the air.

         Since Goldi isn't holding the map anymore, the COTTAGE ITSELF
         begins to drift apart, separating into individual pieces as
         the forest conforms to Kitty's path.

                                GOLDILOCKS
                   No!

                                MAMA BEAR
                   Our cabin!

                                BABY BEAR
                   My honey!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   What the Dickens?!

         OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE: The mountaintop has begun to make a
         slow, turntable spin as the forest conforms to Kitty's path.
         Dog watches, alarmed.

                                DOG
                   Uh-oh.

         He rushes toward the cabin to help his team.

         BACK INSIDE: The cottage itself is beginning to come apart,
         separating into individual pieces and drifting away, zero-
         gravity style.

         The fireplace breaks into separate stones. Flaming logs hover
         from the hearth. Shingles rise from the rooftop like birds in
         flight.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Oh no you don't!

         Goldilocks throws her staff like a javelin, knocking the map
         from Kitty's hand.

         The staff's forked head sticks into a ceiling beam, pinning
         the map in place-- just as the entire roof floats skyward!

         Beneath the map, a myriad of floating debris: all of the
         cabin's component parts, funneling toward the clouds. Goldi
         ascends the floating bits, going for the map. Puss and Kitty
         race after her, pursued by the bears.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   We're coming, Gold---Oh!

         Baby climbs up Papa's shoulders to try to get to Goldi first.

                             BABY BEAR
                   I'll get it. I'll get it!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Oh get off me you big lump!

                             BABY BEAR
                   Hold still!

         Dog streaks in, jumping up over Baby Bear, and across
         hovering honey pots.

                             DOG
                   Hold on! I'm coming teaaammm!

         Dog loses control, crashing into Goldi. The honey pot
         swallows Goldi's face.

         She SCREAMS as she and Dog plummet.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

         The Bears surround the cats on a floating table.

         Kitty extends a paw toward Puss.

                             KITTY
                   Shall we dance?

                                PUSS
                   Huh?

                                KITTY
                   I'll lead.

         The cats clasp hands and lock eyes. They begin to DANCE THEIR
         WAY UP toward the map. They ascend higher and higher, passing
         Goldilocks and the bears.
00


         As Kitty gives Puss a low dip, Puss kicks a bowl of PORRIDGE
         into Mama's face.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Ah! Too hot!

         Kitty and Puss spin. Kitty kicks another porridge bowl into
         Baby's face. Baby hollers and falls away.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Ah! Too cold, brain freeze!

         Puss expertly twirls Kitty, who launches a third bowl at Papa
         Bear. Papa's knocked back into his floating RECLINER CHAIR,
         happily tucking into the tasty porridge.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Ahhh, that is just righhhhht!

         The map is still floating   above Puss and Kitty, but there's
         no remaining objects they   can use to reach it. They share a
         knowing smile and tap out   a flamenco beat, heel-to-heel,
         stomping skyward, dancing   through the very air.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Eh? What the--?

         Finally, The cats reach the map and pull it free. They each
         hold an end of it, their momentum causing them to spin as the
         background goes soft focus and the scene gets VERY ROMANTIC.

         BUT-- the moment is interrupted when the map UNFURLS,
         obscuring Kitty's view. The map redraws itself again, and the
         forest landscape violently conforms to it. (Their next
         destination: Mountains of Misery.)

         The pieces of the cottage thump to earth. So do Puss, Kitty
         and the bears.

         The mountaintop SPLITS and divides them. The cats and the
         bears end up on two separate peaks, rapidly moving apart.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   No!

         Goldilocks and the bears glare at Puss and Kitty angrily.
         Goldilocks is holding Dog, hard-petting him.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   Oi! Forget something?

         Puss and Kitty gasp as the bears recede, VANISHING from
         sight. They're stunned, feeling the weight of their failure
         and the loss of their friend.
01


                             KITTY
                   They got Perrito!

                              PUSS
                   Don't worry, we can track them--
                   with this!

         Puss grabs the map from Kitty. He opens it, starlight
         dazzling in his eyes.

                             KITTY
                   Wait! Stop!

         ON THE MAP: The CAVE OF SHATTERED SOULS appears beside Puss
         and Kitty's AVATARS.

         ON PUSS AND KITTY: HUGE SPARS OF CRYSTAL shoot up from the
         earth! Boulders stack up magically, forming a canopy of
         stone.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Puss, watch out!

         Before Puss can react, a massive CRYSTAL CAVE has formed
         around him.

                             PUSS
                   Kitty!

                             KITTY
                   Puss!


         INT. CRYSTAL CAVE - DAY

         Puss is separated from Kitty by thick crystal. He presses the
         map against the wall for her to see.

                             PUSS
                   Look!
         The map shows the avatars of the Bears and Dog nearby.

                             KITTY
                   There! There they are. Just down
                   there.

                             PUSS
                   You get go Perrito. I'll find a way
                   out of here.

         Kitty nods, holds her paw up against Puss', then RUNS OFF
         into the forest.
02


         INT. CRYSTAL CAVE - DAY

         Puss walks though the cave, holding the map. Crystal pillars
         tower above him, catching reflections. Puss sees multiple
         images of himself, vanishing into infinity. UNEARTHLY VOICES
         ECHO faintly.

                             ECHOING VOICE
                   Puss...

         Puss stops. Did he really hear that?


         INT. CRYSTAL CAVE - CHAMBER OF REFLECTION - CONTINUOUS

         Puss enters a vast crystal chamber and gazes at his
         reflection in a pillar. The reflection is much larger than
         life.

                             SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   Hey, good lookin'!

         The reflection WINKS and tips his hat!

                             PUSS
                   Ohmygah! What is that?!

         Puss yelps in fright and backpedals-- right into another
         pillar. A second jumbo-sized PUSS REFLECTION is looking down
         at him, tossing dice in its paw.

                             GAMBLER PUSS
                   Why so jumpy, amigo?

         Puss is surrounded by crystal columns. Within each, stands
         one of EIGHT DISTINCTIVE PUSS FIGURES. The figures laugh,
         play music and dance as the real-world Puss stands
         speechlessly before them.

         [These are the PUSS FIGURES: Gambler Puss, Guitarist Puss,
         Vanity Puss, Dancing Puss, Burly Puss, Swordsman Puss,
         Pamplona Puss, Tipsy Puss. ]

                             PUSS
                   Whoa... what's happening?

                             PAMPLONA PUSS
                       (mouth full)
                   Hello, Puss. Gazpacho?

         Pamplona Puss tries to hand over a bowl of Gazpacho. It just
         clinks against the crystal.
03


                             GAMBLER PUSS
                   Long time no see!

         GAMBLER PUSS removes his hat and gives a sweeping bow.
         Playing cards fall from his hat.

         VANITY PUSS dramatically turns toward camera. His crystal
         column has frosted glass look-- very Telenovela.

                             VANITY PUSS
                   Always a pleasure to see me!

          Guitarist Puss plays a flamenco flourish.

                             GUITARIST PUSS
                       (singing)
                   Hola, Number Nine!

                             BURLY PUSS
                       (pumping iron)
                   It's a proper party now that all
                   nine of us are here.

                             ALL FORMER LIVES
                   Yeah! / Si Fiesta! / Hahah!

         Tipsy Puss leans into the crystal, breathing heavily on the
         glass.

                             TIPSY PUSS
                   You know what? I love you guys!

                             PUSS
                   So, you are my-- my former lives?

                             VANITY PUSS
                       (gazing into hand mirror)
                   Reflections of the good old days.

                             PUSS
                       (unsure)
                   Okay?

                             BURLY PUSS
                   Back when we were larger than life.

                               SWORDSMAN PUSS(O.S.)
                   A legend!

                               DANCING PUSS
                   We dance!

                               GUTARIST PUSS
                   We sing!
04


                             BURLY PUSS
                   We are strong--

                             ALL FORMER LIVES
                   LIKE THE BULL!

         The real Puss in Boots smiles, impressed. Guitarist Puss
         strums away, launching into a familiar number.

                              GUITARIST PUSS
                   N�mero nueve, you remember this
                   one?
                        (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?

                             ALL REFLECTIONS
                       (singing)
                   Who is your favorite fearless hero?


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - DAY

         Kitty sneaks over a ridge as we hear the bears chattering off-
         screen.

         WITH THE BEARS: They're hard at work, bending branches,
         cinching vines, preparing to build, set and spring a
         monumental TRAP.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Well that's it. Game over, innit?
                   Them cats stole the stolen map we
                   stole and we ended up with didley
                   squat. Nothing!

         Mama attaches a vine to a swarming beehive.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Well, maybe we could be happy
                   without a wish.

         Baby bends a tree limb counter-weighted with rocks.

                             BABY BEAR
                   What are we doing? They ain't
                   coming back. Goodbye, purple
                   trousers.

         Goldi sets Dog down on a stump.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Oh, they'll come back--
05


         REVEAL: The stump is a sensitive trigger, poised in the
         middle of the trap-- and DOG is THE BAIT!

                               GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   For him!

                             DOG
                   You're darn tootin'! Puss and Kitty
                   always rescue me when I'm
                   kidnapped... which happens a lot...
                   Cause we're a TEAM.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Aw, that's lovely.

                             DOG
                   Yep! Team FRIENDSHIP.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Ugh no, that's a crap name.

                             DOG
                   Well, we're still workshopping it.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Them cats ain't gonna risk their
                   lives for this daft little pup.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You're just saying that because you
                   want to eat him.

                               BABY BEAR
                   I do not.

         Baby smiles at Dog, showing his huge chompers.

                             BABY BEAR (CONT'D)
                   I just want to pet him with my
                   teeth.
         WITH KITTY: As the bears chatter, she grabs a pinecone,
         assessing its weight. Seems just about right...

         BACK WITH THE BEARS

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Stop thinking about your belly,
                   Baby. In fact, stop thinking
                   PERIOD. You'll just hurt yourself,
                   you muppet.

                             DOG
                   Ha, ha! Muppet.
06


                             BABY BEAR
                   And why should I listen to a
                   porridge-stealing orphan like you?
                   You're not even a bear.

                             DOG
                   Zing!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Hah! I'm more of a bear than you
                   are.

                             DOG
                   She got you!

                             BABY BEAR
                   You're nothing but a low-rent
                   Cinderella.

                             DOG
                   Oooooh!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Well, that's rich coming from you,
                   Baby. Cause you know what you are?

                             DOG
                       (having a blast)
                   Wait for it...

         Goldi delivers an epic putdown full of rhythm and attitude.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You're a daft, fat, slow-thinking,
                   no-reading, lyme-diseased-flea-
                   ridden-dingleberry-bear!

                             DOG
                   Boom!

                             BABY BEAR
                       (sullen)
                   I haven't got dingleberries!

         Papa gives Baby a sympathetic pat.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   No, you do. You do have `em.

                             DOG
                   Dingleberries!

         Dog LAUGHS hysterically. Baby brandishes a giant claw like a
         switchblade and holds it to his throat.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oi! You shut up, you little mutt,
                   or I'll cut you from pooper to
                   snooter.

                             DOG
                   Ooh, I'm in the mix now!

         Dog is eager to join in and try his hand at roasting the
         bears.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Okay, okay, here we go: you're ALL
                   a bunch of knuckle-dragging, honey-
                   scrounging, grub-munching...
         Goldi and Baby are shocked at Dog's outburst (much of which
         will be tastefully *bleeped*.)

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Oafish *bleep* weed, mangey, butt
                   *bleep*-ing, *bleep* chompin',
                   *bleep* nuggets--

         Papa Bear's mouth is agape. Mama Bear is stunned. Such
         language!

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   *Bleep* *bleep* *bleep* and YOUR
                   snooter!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Ha, ha. I like the cut of his jib.

                             DOG
                   Ah, this is great. Razzin' and
                   ribbin' and barbin' and poopin' and
                   snootin'. Wish I had a family like
                   this.

         Dog turns to Goldi.
                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Speaking from one orphan to
                   another, Goldi... you won the
                   orphan lottery.

         Mama looks to Goldi and smiles.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   I like his jib as well, Goldi.
                   Let's keep him.
08


         SUPRISE REVEAL: Mama and the others look back to see that Dog
         has VANISHED. His place on the stump has been filled by a
         crude, smiling DOG-DOLL fashioned from a pinecone.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Wha--?

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Huh? Where'd he go?

         On the pinecone, a note reading: "YOU'VE BEEN CRIMED--
         KITTY."

                             BABY BEAR
                   Gah! We said no crime backs!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   No, Baby, wait!

         Baby Bear kicks the pinecone in frustration, inadvertently
         SPRINGING THE TRAP! Rocks drop, vine ropes tighten and
         branches SNAP into place as Goldi and the Bears are snared
         up. The BEEHIVE drops to shatter on Baby's head, releasing a
         swarm of angry bees.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oww! Not the bees!


         INT. CRYSTAL CAVE - CHAMBER OF REFLECTION - DAY

         Back with Puss and the EIGHT LIVES, dancing and singing. Puss
         hits a triumphant high note, finishing big.

                             PUSS
                       (singing)
                   The legend will never die!

          The others lives CHEER and LAUGH.

                             SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   Bravo! Ha, ha!

                             BURLY PUSS
                   The voice of an angel!

                             GUITARIST PUSS
                   One more number!

                             PUSS
                   No, no, sorry, fellas. This has
                   been fun, but-- could you tell me
                   how to get out of here? I've got to
                   get back to Dog and Kitty.
09


         Detuning guitar sound as the MUSIC STOPS. The lives blink at
         Puss.

                             BURLY PUSS
                   Whoa! I thought you were going to
                   get the wish. You got the map. You
                   don't need them.

                             SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   Yeah! Get those lives back. Become
                   the legend again. Town to town.

                             TIPSY PUSS
                   Party to party.

         IMAGES appear   within the walls of crystal, illuminating these
         words. We see   scenes of: Puss standing before adoring crowds;
         Puss riding a   horse, framed by a spectacular sunset; Puss
         holding court   in a crowded tavern...

                             VANITY PUSS
                   Puss in Boots walks alone!

         MORE IMAGES within the crystal walls: A scene of Puss riding
         alone; Puss, by himself in a tavern after everyone else has
         gone home; Puss alone beside a campfire, staring into the
         flames....

                             PUSS
                       (sotto)
                   Yeah... Puss in Boots walks alone.

         Finally, Puss has his epiphany.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Was the legend so big there was no
                   room for anyone else?

         A FINAL IMAGE: Puss alone on the hill in Santa Coloma,
         overlooking the church.
                             SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   The legend is STILL big, gato. It's
                   YOU that got small.

                             BURLY PUSS
                   Yeah, you changed man.

                             GAMBLER PUSS
                   I hear he's best friends with a Dog
                   now.
10


                              SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   And he doesn't even have a sword!
                       (laughs)
                   Some hero.

                             BURLY PUSS
                   You have become a scaredy cat! We
                   should call him "Wuss in Boots."

                             ALL LIVES
                   Ha, ha, ha!

                             TIPSY PUSS
                   No, no, no, no! Didn't you hear?
                   His new name is "Pickles!"

         The reflected lives LAUGH MOCKINGLY and high-five each other

                             GAMBLER PUSS
                   So lame! Ha, ha, ha!

                             VANITY PUSS
                   Ha, ha! Where's your litter box,
                   Pickles?

                             PUSS
                   You know what, you guys are
                   jerks... which is VERY conflicting
                   for me. I'll find my own way out!
                   Adios!

                             PAMPLONA PUSS
                   Oh? You think you're better than
                   us? Without us, you will always
                   live a life of--

                             WOLF (O.S.)
                   FEAR.

         THE WOLF'S IMAGE appears in the crystal walls, multiplied a
         thousand times over, a monster in a mirror maze.

                             PUSS
                   You!

                             WOLF
                   I do love the smell of fear.
                       (sniff)
                   It's INTOXICATING.

                             TIPSY PUSS
                   It is?
11


         The Wolf draws his sickles and shatters Tipsy's column with a
         single blow. SMASH!

                             WOLF
                   Sorry to crash this party with your
                   past lives-- or past deaths, as I
                   like to call them.

         PAMPLONA PUSS spits out his gazpacho. The Wolf smashes his
         reflection.

         He holds up the sickles, displaying eight notches on the
         blades.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   I was there to witness all of them.
                   Each frivolous end. But you didn't
                   even notice me. Because Puss in
                   Boots laughs in the face of death.
                   Right?

         SMASH! SMASH! The Wolf shatters DANCING PUSS and GUITARIST
         PUSS.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   But you're not laughing now.

         He tips over Burly Puss' crystal column. It explodes against
         the cave floor.

                             PUSS
                   You are no bounty hunter! You are--

         SMASH! The Wolf takes out VANITY PUSS.

                             WOLF
                   DEATH. And I don't mean it
                   metaphorically or rhetorically, or
                   poetically or theoretically or in
                   any other fancy way.
         The Wolf looms over Puss.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   I'm DEATH STRAIGHT-UP. And I've
                   come for you, Puss in Boots.

                             PUSS
                   But-- I'm still alive.

                             WOLF
                   You know, I'm not a cat person. I
                   find the very idea of nine lives
                   absurd.
                             (MORE)
12

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   And you didn't value any of them.
                   So why don't I do us both a favor
                   and take this last one now?

                             GAMBLER PUSS
                   That's cheating!

                             WOLF
                   Shhh. Don't tell.

         The Wolf tosses a sickle over his shoulder and SMASHES
         Gambler Puss into tiny shards.

                             SWORDSMAN PUSS
                   Run Puss in Boots! Make the wish!

         The Wolf shatters the last crystal column. No more former
         lives left.

                             WOLF
                   Go ahead, run for it. Makes it more
                   fun for me.

         Puss does. He runs.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST    - NIGHT

         Kitty is running too, carrying Dog, approaching the cave.


         INT. CRYSTAL CAVE - NIGHT

         Puss rushes through the maze of crystal, the Wolf's mocking
         laughter close behind. Finally, he emerges from the cave and
         BOLTS into the night.


         EXT. DARK FOREST - MOUNTAINTOP - CONTINUOUS

         Kitty and Dog reach a ridge looking down at the cave. They
         see Puss rush out and head into the forest with the map.

                                DOG
                   Hey, Puss!

         Kitty waves. Puss sees her, but, consumed with fear, he keeps
         running.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Puss! Puss, we're here!

         Kitty's smile fades as Puss leaves her and Dog behind.
13


                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (to Kitty)
                   Where-- where's he going?


         EXT. STAR CANYON - NIGHT

         Puss reaches a forest clearing and GASPS.

         He stands on the brim of a canyon punched deep into the
         earth, staring down at THE WISHING STAR. It's MASSIVE,
         shimmering with ethereal power.

                              PUSS
                   Whoa.

         EXT. THE WISHING STAR - NIGHT

         The surface of the star. Pure silver. Puss walks across it,
         kicking up stardust.

         He reaches the center of the star, stops and looks around
         uncertainly. The map begins to glow. The star begins to
         "power up," rising up through the canyon.


         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears trudge through the forest,
         exhausted.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   That's the third time we've passed
                   that same rock, Baby.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Oh, not again!

                             BABY BEAR
                   What do you want me to do?! I've
                   lost the scent!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   You only have one job. The one
                   thing that makes you mildly useful
                   is your nose, and apparently you
                   can't even use that!

                              MAMA BEAR
                   Goldi...

         Baby gets right into Goldi's face, the frustration running
         high.
14


                             BABY BEAR
                   I'm starting to think this wish
                   isn't what you promised us.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Leave off, Baby.

                             BABY BEAR
                   So what is it, eh? What's your Just
                   Right? What's so blasted important
                   that you've got us stranded in this
                   haunted forest?!

         Goldi finally snaps.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   I'm getting a family, that's what!
                   A proper family. Then, everything
                   will be JUST RIGHT!

         Baby is shocked. He slumps to the ground and sits there,
         blinking.

                             BABY BEAR
                   So-- your Just Right is getting rid
                   of us?

         Papa speaks softly, terribly hurt.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Well, I guess some people just
                   stick around until the porridge is
                   gone. Eh, Goldi?

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Come on... you didn't think I would
                   actually stay? I'm not a bear.

         A RUMBLE in the distance. A towering beam of silver light
         appears above the tree line. It could only be the Wishing
         Star. Goldi looks at it, transfixed. Mama approaches.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   I was always afraid it was too good
                   to last. And whether you think
                   we're your family or not, if this
                   is something that will make you
                   happy, we'll get you that wish.
                       (solemnly)
                   Come on, boys.

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears head for the beam of
         starlight.

         EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DIFFERENT LOCATION - NIGHT

         Jack Horner emerges from the forest with the last baker. He
         spots the light on the horizon and casts away his crystal
         ball.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Oh, what a good boy am I.


         EXT. THE WISING STAR - NIGHT

         Puss unfolds the enchanted map. Another incantation appears
         on it, shimmering.

                             PUSS
                       (reading)
                   "Star light, star bright,
                   First star I see tonight,
                   I wish--"

                             KITTY (O.S.)
                   I can't believe I fell for it
                   again.

         Kitty is standing with Dog at the star's edge.

                             PUSS
                   Kitty, you don't understand...

                             KITTY
                   Don't understand what? That you've
                   been playing me this whole time?

                             PUSS
                   I need this wish.

                             KITTY
                   Oh yeah? You want to know what my
                   wish was? Someone, ANYONE, I could
                   trust. In my whole life I've never
                   had that.
                       (sighs)
                   I thought I finally found that
                   someone-- without a wish. I thought
                   it was you.

         Kitty shakes her head, bitterly disappointed.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   But you're still running. Still the
                   same old Puss in Boots.
16


                             PUSS
                   But I'm not! I'm not Puss in Boots!
                   I'm on my last life! I need to get
                   my lives back! Without them I am
                   not...I am not...

                             KITTY
                   What? The legend? I still can't
                   compete with your one true love.

         Kitty turns on her heel and walks off.

                             KITTY (CONT'D)
                   Go on. Get your lives back, Puss in
                   Boots. Just keep them out of mine.
                             PUSS
                       (calling after)
                   Kitty, death is after me!

         Kitty hesitates, looks back. Then--

                             JACK HORNER (O.S.)
                   I've been called a lot of things.
                   But never "death." I like it.

         Jack hops down onto the star, holding his magic nanny-bag.
         His last baker accompanies him.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   That's MY WISH.

         Mama Bear jumps down onto a different point of the star.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Oi! That's Goldi's wish!

         Goldilocks vaults onto the star, followed by Papa and Baby
         Bear.

         They're all here, standing on the five points of the Wishing
         Star: the world's greatest fairy tale thieves, converging at
         last on the ultimate enchanted prize, the legendary ONE WISH.

         FAST CUTTING CLOSE UPS: EYES darting back and forth, ala The
         Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. A moment of unbearable suspense.

         DRAMATIC DOWN SHOT: Everyone CHARGES toward the center of the
         star, right at Puss!

         It's a back and forth melee'. Goldi launches herself at Puss,
         swinging her staff. Kitty leaps to Puss' defense and parries
         the blow.
17


                              PAPA BEAR
                   Grab it!

                             JACK HORNER (O.S.)
                   Move! Outta my way!

         In the scuffle, Puss drops the map. It blows across the
         surface of the star.

                             BABY BEAR
                   I've got it! I've got it!

         Dog swoops in and trips Baby before he can grab the map.

                             BABY BEAR (CONT'D)
                   Don't got it!
                             JACK HORNER
                   That's mine!

         Jack pulls a WIZARD'S STAFF from his bag and shoots bolts of
         rapid-fire magic.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Bang! Bang! Bang!

         Kitty somersaults, dodging the indiscriminate fire. Jack
         accidentally blasts his own baker, knocking her to the star's
         edge.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Oh, come on! You walked into that
                   one!

         The Wishing Star continues to ascend, its magic getting
         stronger. UNBOUND MAGIC swirls at its edges, drawing things
         toward it: including the unfortunate baker-- she distorts,
         unraveling as she's pulled though the air.

                             BAKER #2
                   Mister Horner! I need your help!
                             JACK HORNER
                       (spotting the map)
                   Duly noted, but a little busy at
                   the moment. Pew! Pew!

                             BAKER #2
                   Mister Horner!

         BZZZZRRT! The baker dissolves into a swarm of magical sparks!
18


         Jack scrambles for the map, but before he can get to it, Mama
         Bear blocks the way. Jack points his staff at her, lining up
         a shot.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Ooh, it's bear season!

         Baby Bear lunges in, knocking Jack back. Baby stands over
         him, slamming his fist into his palm.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oi! I'm gonna bust you up, plum-
                   thumb! And then I'm going to wear
                   your clothes!

                             JACK HORNER
                   That was weird.

         Jack zaps Baby, lifting him off his feet. Baby is drawn
         through the space, caught in the magnetic tug of star magic.

                                MAMA BEAR
                   Baby!

                             BABY BEAR
                   Mama, help!

                                MAMA BEAR
                   I got you!

                                BABY BEAR
                   Papa!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Son! I'm coming! Got you!

         Papa and Mama Bear grab onto Baby's feet, trying to rescue
         him. It's no good-- the entire bear family is being drawn
         into danger, linked like a daisy-chain!

                                BABY BEAR
                   Help!

                                MAMA BEAR (O.S.)
                   Hold on!

         MEANWHILE: Goldilocks stands before the map. This is the
         opportunity she's been waiting a lifetime for. She reaches
         for it, but then--

                             BABY BEAR (O.S.)
                   Something's happening! Help me! No,
                   no, no!
19


         --she looks over her shoulder. Across the star, she sees the
         BEARS IN PERIL.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Hang on, son!

                             PAPA BEAR
                   I can't stop it!

         Baby's paw starts to slip from Mama's grasp.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Mama I'm slipping. I'm
                   slippinnnggg!

         Things are looking grim. Baby is warping, distorting, about
         to be pulled into the magic wall, when-- GOLDILOCKS COMES TO
         THE RESCUE, snaring Baby Bear with her staff and pulling him
         to safety.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Like I told you, Baby. You're the
                   smash, I'm the grab.

                               BABY BEAR
                   Yes! Yes!

         Goldilocks and the bears collapse in a big, furry heap.

         BACK WITH JACK: Since Goldi has abandoned the map, he's able
         to grab it. Puss is too far away to stop him--

                               PUSS
                   No!

         But Kitty isn't! She makes a spectacular leap and kicks Jack
         HARD. He staggers back, losing his WIZARDS STAFF.

         Undeterred, Jack pulls out POISON APPLE GRENADES from his
         nanny-bag.

                             JACK HORNER
                   Hey, Softpaws! How do you like
                   THESE apples?!

         He chucks the apple-grenades at Kitty. She expertly dodges
         them, avoiding explosions and billowing, toxic clouds of bad
         magic.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Die! Blow up already!!

         Jack keeps tossing apples. Finally, Kitty makes an amazing
         MID-AIR catch, snatching the last of them in her paws.
20


                                KITTY
                   Soft-paws.

                                JACK HORNER
                          (rolling his eyes)
                   Ugh.

         She throws the apple back at Jack. It explodes! Jack stumbles
         and falls to his knees.

         Shaken, Jack seems to speak with great solemnity...

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Okay, okay... you know, maybe it's
                   time to bury the...HATCHET! Ha ha!
         Jack whips a HATCHET out of his bag. But before he can use
         it, Kitty delivers a spinning kick that sends him tumbling
         backwards into the bag's endless depths.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                       (falling)
                   Ahh, I shouldn't have telegraphed
                   it....

         Kitty shuts the bag with her foot.

         The map is FLOATING AWAY, borne on celestial winds. Dog jumps
         into the air and catches it. He slides to a stop in front of
         Puss and hands him the map.

                             DOG
                   Yeah, I dunno what to do with this.
                   But, if you think you need those
                   lives...

                             PUSS
                       (taking it)
                   Thank you, Perrito.

                             DOG
                   You know, I've only ever had one
                   life-- but sharing it with you and
                   Kitty has made it pretty special.
                   Maybe one life is enough...

         That resonates with Puss. But, before he can respond, a
         WHISTLE rises from nowhere, from everywhere.

                             PAPA BEAR
                   What is that?

         The Wolf steps through a curtain of starlight. He looks
         bigger and stronger than ever.
21


                             DOG
                   Who's that?

                             PUSS
                   He's here for me.

         The Wolf STRIKES the star with his sickles, creating screens
         of magic that rise, isolating Puss. Kitty's eyes widen. She
         and Dog are cut off from him.

                             KITTY
                   Puss!

         It's one on one. The Wolf stalks forward, death incarnate,
         savoring the moment.

                             WOLF
                   I've enjoyed the chase, gato.
                   But I think we've reached the end
                   now, you and I.

         He clashes his blades together, the sound ringing out across
         the star.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   You gonna take the coward's way
                   out? Run away to more lives? Or are
                   you gonna fight?

         The Wolf tosses something onto the ground: PUSS' SWORD.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Pick it up.

         Puss looks down at the incantation on the map, considering.

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Go on. Pick it up!

         Once again, the sound of Puss' heartbeat plays over moments
         from his life. But now they are scenes of the RECENT PAST,
         happy and impactful moments with Kitty and Dog.

         MONTAGE IMAGES: Meeting Dog, reuniting with Kitty in Horner's
         office, the CUTE-EYE battle, smelling roses with Dog, dancing
         with Kitty...

                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   What's the matter? Lives flashing
                   before your eyes?

                             PUSS
                   No, just one. I'm done running.
22


         Puss drops the map, picks up his sword and accepts the
         challenge. He faces down the Wolf with no lives to spare.

                               PUSS (CONT'D)
                     Fear me, if you dare.

                               WOLF
                     This is going to be fun.

         After a series of furious exchanges, Puss manages to knock
         the Wolf back.

                               WOLF (CONT'D)
                     Bien. Muy bien.

         The Wolf connects his sickles into one menacing, TWO-HEADED
         SCYTHE. He spins the weapon adroitly and ATTACKS. The fight
         rages back and forth. Finally, a slashing move sends Puss'
         sword flying.

                               WOLF (CONT'D)
                     Tsk, tsk. You really gotta stop
                     losing that.

         Kitty and Dog look on from outside, alarmed, as--

         The Wolf CHARGES. Puss pulls out Kitty's dagger, and blocks a
         savage blow. And another!

                               PUSS
                     Say hello to my gatito blade!

         Then, he   dives through the Wolf's legs and retrieves his
         sword at   last. Puss deftly cuts the Wolf's weapon into
         separate   halves. The Wolf stumbles as his sickles clatter
         onto the   star's surface.

                               PUSS (CONT'D)
                     Pick it up.

         The Wolf is shocked. How can this be?
                               PUSS (CONT'D)
                     I know I can never defeat you,
                     lobo. But I will never stop
                     fighting for this life.

         The Wolf takes up his weapons and steps slowly toward Puss.
         He gets very close and leans in, fixing Puss with a
         penetrating gaze. Then--
23


                             WOLF
                   Grrr...Porque diablos fui a jugar
                   con mi comida! Arggggghh! You're
                   ruining this for me!

         The Wolf leans in for another look, just to make sure. No
         doubt about it, this is a changed gato.

                              WOLF (CONT'D)
                   I came here for an arrogant little
                   legend who thought he was immortal,
                       (sigh)
                   But I don't see him anymore.

         The Wolf spins his sickles like a gunslinger, holsters them
         and turns away.
                             WOLF (CONT'D)
                   Live your life, Puss in Boots. Live
                   it well.
                       (looking back)
                   You know we will meet again, right?

                             PUSS
                       (tipping his hat)
                   Si hasta la muerte.

         The Wolf steps through the curtain of light and vanishes. As
         the light ebbs, Kitty rushes up to Puss.

                             KITTY
                   You know, when you said death was
                   after you, I thought you were being
                   melodramatic.

         Puss hands the map to Kitty.

                             PUSS
                   The wish is yours. You deserve
                   someone you can trust.
                             KITTY
                   I don't need it. I've got what I've
                   wished for.
                       (smiles)
                   No magic required.

                             JACK HORNER (O.S.)
                   Oh, magic snacks!

         CLOSE on the nanny bag. We hear the sound of loud, deliberate
         chewing, punctuated with a resounding BELCH. A cookie wrapper
         lofts out of the bag. It reads: EAT ME.
24


         A GIANT-SIZED Jack Horner rises from the tiny bag, like a
         wicked genie from a lamp.

                                BABY BEAR
                   Uh oh.

                             PUSS
                   Holy frijoles.

                             JACK HORNER
                   I was worried for a second I'd come
                   out naked, but my clothes grew too!
                   Cool!

         Jack stretches out one massive hand, snatches the map and
         holds it high.

                                JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Thank you!

         The map is tiny in his hands, the size of a playing card.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   The LAST WISH. It's mine!

         Jack chuckles as the incantation sparkles to life.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                       (reading)
                   "Star light, star bright, first
                   star I see tonight. I wish I may, I
                   wish--"

                             DOG (O.S.)
                   Se�or Horner!

         Jack lowers the map, distracted. Dog is gazing up at him.

                                JACK HORNER
                   What?
                             DOG
                   Please, don't make that wish!
                   Please!

         One of dog's eyes is twitching, getting bigger.

                             DOG (CONT'D)
                       (straining)
                   Pleeease!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Wha--? What are you doing?
25


                                DOG
                   Plee-ease!

                             JACK HORNER
                   Seriously. Are you having a hernia
                   or something?

         And bigger--

                             DOG
                   Pleee-eeeeease!!!!

         DOG HAS DONE IT! He's mastered the feline CUTE-EYES trick.
         His eyes are big, dewy and totally adorable. Jack seems
         profoundly moved...

                             JACK HORNER
                   They're such pools of
                   vulnerability. It's so cute-- how
                   you think that would work on me.
                   Don't you know I'm dead inside? By
                   the way, your nose is bleeding.

         Dog wipes his nose, shrugging it off.

                             DOG
                   Oh, I was just buying some time for
                   TEAM FRIENDSHIP!

                                JACK HORNER
                   Team what?

         Jack looks off and sees-- Puss and Kitty, perched on
         Goldilocks' staff. Goldi spins the staff at high speed,
         launching the cats into the air. They soar heroically, swords
         catching starlight.

         FFFFT! Puss and Kitty bury their blades right under Jack's
         giant thumbnail!

                             PUSS/KITTY
                   The Spanish Splinter!

                                JACK HORNER
                   Ahhhhhgh!

         Jack drops the map and flings the cats aside! As the map
         flutters down, Puss, Kitty and Goldi grab it. They lock eyes
         and then, together, they deliberately RIP THE MAP into
         pieces!

         VERY HIGH ANGLE: The STAR ITSELF RIPS just like the map, a
         jagged crack splintering down its center. Raw energy surges
         as its surface BUCKLES!
26


                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   What have you done?! No!

         The STAR IS COLLAPSING, folding in on itself, burning with
         imploding enchantments. Jack scurries after the pieces of the
         map, trying to put them back together.

                             JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   The map! My wish!

         Goldi and the bears claw up a nearly vertical splinter of the
         star.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Go, go, go!
         Puss, Kitty and Dog follow them, making a final, desperate
         leap to the canyon's edge. The bears lend an assist, pulling
         them to safety.

         The Wishing Star is slipping back into the canyon, which
         brims with molten silvery, star-stuff.

         Jack gathers up the fragments of the map. They knit magically
         back together.

                                JACK HORNER
                   It's mine.

         Jack LAUGHS, but then realizes that there's ONE MISSING PIECE-
         - and a GAPING HOLE in the center of the map.

                                JACK HORNER (CONT'D)
                   Huh?

                             ETHICAL BUG (O.S.)
                   You looking for something?

         REVEAL: ETHICAL BUG is soaring through the air on the back of
         the NOBLE PHOENIX. In his hand, the MISSING PIECE.
                             ETHICAL BUG (CONT'D)
                   Consider this my resignation,
                   mister!

         Bug tosses the last scrap and the Phoenix SCORCHES IT. Jack
         CRIES OUT. His foot breaks through the shattered surface of
         the star.

                              JACK HORNER
                   Oh! What did I do to deserve
                   this?
                       (beat)
                   I mean, what specifically?
27


         As Jack sinks away forever, he flashes a final, monumental
         THUMBS-DOWN.

         VERY WIDE as the star EXPLODES, funneling enchanted power
         into the heavens. The COSMOS SHINE with silver light.
         Millions of shooting stars scatter across the sky. It's
         magical. Beautiful. Breathtaking.

         Puss and Kitty stare up at the most romantic night sky in
         history. The FALLING STARS streak across the heavens like
         silver rain, reflecting in their eyes.

                             KITTY
                   I hate to say it, but-- should we
                   make a wish?

                             PUSS
                   Kitty, one life spent with you is
                   all that I could wish for.

         Dog joins Puss and Kitty as they watch the celestial display.

         WITH GOLDI AND THE BEARS

                             BABY BEAR
                   You saved my life, sis.
                       (sobbing)
                   You was gonna make the wish, but
                   you didn't make the wish `cause you
                   wanted to save your family.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Shhh...

                             BABY BEAR
                       (totally breaking down)
                   ... and then I-- I was really
                   scared...

         Goldi pinches Baby's cheeks.

                              GOLDILOCKS
                   Oi don't get so blubbery about it.
                   Whose porridge would I eat
                   otherwise?

                             MAMA BEAR
                   I'm sorry you didn't get your wish,
                   Goldi-love.

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   But I did, Mama. I did get my wish.
                   Everything is Just Right.
28


         Papa and Baby join Mama and Goldi for a group hug, a sweet
         familial moment.

                             MAMA BEAR
                   Oh, now you've made me cry.

                              GOLDILOCKS
                   Now-- what say we all go home and
                   hibernate?

                             PAPA BEAR
                   Goldi, you're a chip off the old
                   block, you are!

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Well, what can I say? I won the
                   orphan lottery.

         Goldi climbs up on Mama Bear's shoulders. She gives a wink to
         Dog and a nod of respect to her former rivals.

                             GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                   Softpaws. Boots.

                             PUSS
                   Goldi.

                             KITTY
                   Bears.

         As the bears head off--

                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Hey Baby, you got any ideas for our
                   next job?

                             BABY BEAR
                   Oh! Remember that pie factory? I
                   suspect that they might be
                   experiencing a leadership vacuum...
                             MAMA BEAR
                   Ooo! A family business! How
                   exciting!

         Ethical Bug floats in, landing on Baby's nose.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Now's a good time to talk about
                   ethical business practices...

                             BABY BEAR
                   Ah! There's a talking cockroach on
                   my nose! Get it off! Get it off!
29


                             GOLDILOCKS
                   Hold still.

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Now wait just a second.

         Goldi tries to swat the bug, but ends up BOPPING Baby hard on
         the nose.

                             BABY BEAR
                   Owww!

                             ETHICAL BUG
                   Hey! Hang on a minute--

         Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Ethical Bug disappear into
         the forest, chattering chaotically.

         BACK WITH THE CATS AND DOG:

                             PUSS
                   Hey, Perrito, about that name.
                   Let's pick one out for you.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah! What about Chiquito?

                             PUSS
                   Chomper! What do you think,
                   Perrito? Chomper, no?

                             KITTY
                   I've got it! I got it! How about
                   Jeff!

                             PUSS
                   Jeff? He doesn't have a Jeff face.

         Dog laughs.

                             DOG
                   You know, if it's the same to you,
                   I think I'll just stick with
                   Perrito. I kinda like it, since
                   that's what my friends call me.

                             KITTY
                       (smiles)
                   Then Perrito it shall be.

         PAN UP as the three of them look happily to a sky filled with
         stars and a future full of promise.

                             PUSS (O.S.)
                   You know to be honest, Chomper is
                   pretty good...

                             DOG (O.S.)
                   Yeah, but no.

                             PUSS (O.S.)
                   Well, we'll keep workshopping it.

         As a final star streaks across the sky, we--

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.


         EXT. DEL MAR - DOCKS - DAY

         DOCKSIDE in the village where the movie started. The Governor
         is walking toward us, carrying the same suitcases he had
         earlier. An entourage trails him, bearing more luggage.

                             GOVERNOR
                   I want this vacation to be perfect.
                   Did you remember to pack my
                   captain's hat?

                             ASSISTANT
                   Yes, Governor. And your captain's
                   shoes, your captain's coat and your
                   captain's pajamas.

                             GOVERNOR
                   And what about-- MY BOAT?

         REVERSE: VERY WIDE. An giant empty spot on the dock as the
         Governor's ship sails away!

         The image of a bounty poster SMASH CUTS onto the screen. It
         has engravings of Puss, Kitty and Dog and reads, WANTED: TEAM
         FRIENDSHIP.

                             GOVERNOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                   PUSS IN BOOOOTS!!!!


         EXT. THE HIGH SEAS - EVENING

         The governor's galleon crests a giant wave. ON DECK: Dog
         balances on top of the ship's wheel, setting a course. He's
         wearing one of the Governor's powdered wigs and nibbling on a
         sandwich.

                              PUSS (O.S.)
                   Perrito!
31


         CLOSE ON: The TEAM FRIENDSHIP poster, pinned to the ship's
         mast with a knife. Puss pulls the poster free.

                             PUSS (CONT'D)
                   Team Friendship? We did not agree
                   to this!

         WIDER TO REVEAL: Puss and Kitty, also wearing SILLY WIGS.

                             KITTY
                   Yeah, it makes us look ridiculous!

                             DOG
                   Too late now! It's official!

         A seagull dive-bombs Dog, stealing his sandwich.
                             DOG (CONT'D)
                   Ah! Seagull!

         Dog loses control of the wheel, clinging to it as it makes a
         360 spin and the deck tilts wildly. Puss and Kitty lose their
         wigs as Puss tumbles into Kitty's arms. They gaze
         romantically into each other's eyes.

                             KITTY
                       (still gazing)
                   Steady as she goes, Perrito.

                             DOG
                   Okie doke! Where are we headed,
                   anyways?

         Puss and Kitty join Dog at the helm.

                             PUSS
                   Off to find new adventures. And to
                   see some old friends...

         A BEAUTY SHOT as the Galleon sails toward emerald shores.
         Signage propped up in the verdant hills reads: FAR, FAR,
         AWAY.

                                    THE END
