                              FERRARI






    SUPER:                       1957


1   EXT. FARMHOUSE. CASTELVETRO. MORNING                       1

    Dawn over the Emilia. Still air... the flutter of ducks
    rising off water. No sun as yet, just a bleak blue light,
    streaking the East. A long way away the howl of a steam train
    heading out across the flat Emilian plain towards Modena.


2   INT. LINA'S BEDROOM. CASTELVETRO. MORNING.                 2

    ENZO FERRARI wakes. He's in his 50s. In the distance he hears
    the Naples/Milan Sleeper clatter over the points at
    Castelfranco... He looks at his watch. Beside him is LINA
    LARDI. She's 15 years younger with auburn hair. She stirs. He
    untangles their limbs and slides out, letting her sleep.


3   INT. THE HALLWAY. CASTELVETRO. MORNING.                    3

    Dressed, he creeps past the boy's room. Its door open, his
    son, PIERO LARDI, is asleep. He steps in, sits on the side of
    the bed.

    FERRARI tucks in the covers around him, like a cocoon. He
    brushes aside his hair and kisses his forehead. Walls have
    news paper clippings, as many bicycle racing as motor sports.
    Then FERRARI is down the stairs. At the bottom he puts on his
    shoes.


4   EXT. FARMHOUSE. CASTELVETRO. MORNING.                      4

    He opens the door of his old Peugeot 403.

    He disengages the handbrake and shoves the car, so it will
    freewheel down the incline towards the farm gates. So as not
    to wake the family with its starting. He slips aboard.


5   INT. THE PEUGEOT. MORNING.                                 5

    FERRARI draws the door shut. As he passes the gatepost, he
    turns the car into the road. It gathers speed. Only now, he
    flicks on the ignition, pulls out the choke, shifts from
    neutral into second gear and releases the clutch, bumping the
    engine into life.
                                                                2.


    The revs climb. He slips into third.

    A turn approaches. His right toe caresses the brake while his
    right heel blips the throttle while his left touches the
    clutch and he's shifted into neutral, revs the engine,
    declutching again, upshifting into second -- all so fluidly
    in a third of a second that it sounds like three ascending
    notes on a scale.

    He's a large man, adroitly driving the old Peugeot with the
    skill of the racer he once was and still is.

    He accelerates down the straight road ahead to town.

    Meanwhile--


6   INT. PLATFORM. MODENA STATION. THE NIGHT TRAIN. MORNING.         6

    It shudders to a stop. An opera company disembarks. The
    SINGERS clutch their fur collared coats and hats against the
    morning cold. The ORCHESTRA carry their instruments.

    From the next carriage -- an overnight bag drops onto the
    platform. From the bag hangs a pair of racing goggles. A man
    dismounts: squat, wide-shouldered. He picks up the bag. He is
    race car driver JEAN BEHRA.

    The GUARD blows his whistle. There is a hiss of superheated
    steam, a roar from the engine. From the last carriage a
    second, younger man steps onto the platform. He too carries a
    small bag from which hang two pairs of racing goggles.
    Unshaven and wild-looking in a leather jacket and jeans, he
    resembles Marlon Brando in THE WILD ONE. He is Alfonso Cabeza
    de Vaca y Leighton, Marquis de Portago... better known as FON
    DE PORTAGO.

    He begins to walk up the platform following the others.


7   INT. FERRARI'S HOUSE IN MODENA, FERRARI BEDROOM. MORNING.        7

    The phone rings by a bed. It has not been slept in. It is
    Ferrari's. The door to the room opens. A sleepy woman of
    about forty-seven with steely eyes and a wiry lissome body
    picks it up. This is LAURA FERRARI. She is Ferrari's wife.

                        LAURA
              Yes?


8   INT. STATION OFFICE. MODENA. MORNING.                            8

    The PORTER, as if a spy conveying an important secret --
                                                                3.


                         PORTER
               Please inform Signor Ferrari that
               Jean Behra has just arrived on the
               overnight from Milan.

     He bows to the telephone.

                         PORTER (CONT'D)
               Thank you, most excellent and
               gracious Signora.


9    INT. FERRARI'S HOUSE IN MODENA, BEDROOM. MORNING.               9

     LAURA stares down at Enzo's empty bed, hangs up.

     The phone rings again. She picks it up. This time it is
     Ferrari's chief engineer, CARLO CHITI.

                         CHITI (V.O.)
               Laura? It's Chiti. Is he there?

                         LAURA
               He's taking a shower.

                         CHITI (V.O.)
               Give him a message, please -- Jean
               Behra is in town.


10   EXT. FORECOURT. MODENA STATION. MORNING.                    10

     The mysteriously important BEHRA stands by the curb. A
     Maserati convertible pulls up. He stamps out his cigarette.
     OMER ORSI - one of Maserati's owners - greets him with a
     handshake and he piles in --

     As they drive off the last of the OPERA COMPANY board an
     upright old coach.

                          TENOR
                   (bitterly)
               You will notice that -- for stars
               of the racing world -- there is a
               heroes' welcome. For us, not even a
               porter.

     As the coach takes off, we're left with FON DE PORTAGO. There
     is no taxi. The bells for 7 a.m. mass begin to ring.
                                                              4.


11   EXT. INTERSECTION. VITTORIO EMANUELE. MORNING.               11

     DE PORTAGO enters and carries his bag down the middle of the
     deserted Corso. A small Peugeot scoots past him and comes to
     a halt at a red light. DE PORTAGO recognizes the driver.

     FERRARI checks his watch. He's late.

                         DE PORTAGO
               Signor Ferrari!

     DE PORTAGO runs towards the car.

     FERRARI glances at the approaching Spaniard.

                         DE PORTAGO (CONT'D)
               May I present myself. I am Alfonso
               de Portago.

     The light turns to green. FERRARI accelerates away--

     DE PORTAGO slows to a walk. One look has confirmed everything
     he had heard about the man. He'd be a bastard to work for.

     He starts across a deserted intersection towards the Corso
     Vittoria Emanuelle.


12   EXT. THE PIAZZA GARIBALDI. MODENA. MORNING.                  12

     The church bells are still ringing. A FLOWER WOMAN puts out
     her wares on the corner. A nearby news kiosk opens its
     shutters. FERRARI arrives in front of his house in the old
     Peugeot.

     The bus from the station has pulled up in front of the Opera
     House a few doors down. A SMALL WELCOMING COMMITTEE of
     patrons and workers has assembled to greet them.

     One of them is GIACOMO "MINO" CUOGHI. A short, dapper
     attorney, a very bright and confident man, with a limp from
     childhood polio. He's FERRARI'S school friend and business
     counselor.

     A cry goes up from the STAGEHANDS among the welcoming
     committee.

                         STAGEHAND
               Hey, it's Ferrari.

     There is a spontaneous burst of applause, their backs to the
     opera singers, which FERRARI acknowledges as he gets out of
     the car.
                                                                5.


                          CUOGHI
                   (shouts)
               Good morning, Enzo! Your friends
               are back.

     He indicates the OPERA SINGERS...

                         FERRARI
               This time, I hope in tune.

                         TENOR
               More in tune than your cars in
               Monaco last week.

     Laughter... FERRARI smiles at the retort. He crosses the
     cobble-stoned inner apron.

                         CUOGHI
               Enzo, we have to talk...

                           FERRARI
               That bad?

                         CUOGHI
               I will come by later.

     FERRARI opens the door to his house, a large burgher's
     mansion, built in the Northern Italian style.


13   INT. LAURA'S SUITE. FERRARI'S HOUSE. MORNING.                13

     LAURA hears the front door slam and FERRARI's footsteps on
     the stone stairs.

     She sits on her bed. Frozen anger registers on her face. She
     hears him pass her door. She gets up, crosses to the bureau,
     pulls open a drawer. Inside is a pistol.

     His door closes.


14   INT. FERRARI'S SUITE, LARGO GARIBALDI. MORNING.              14

     The phone is ringing. FERRARI ignores it. He crosses to the
     shower, turns it on, comes back into the room. He opens the
     shutters, letting in the morning light and the sound of the
     bells...

     He picks up the phone. It is CARLO CHITI again.
                                                                 6.


15   INT. CHITI'S DINING ROOM. MODENA. MORNING.                   15

                         CHITI
               Behra's in town. Anyone tell you?
               The Orsi boys collected him at the
               station. Did she tell you? The word
               is he's going to challenge our
               record.


16   INT. FERRARI'S SUITE. LAURA IN THE DOORWAY. MORNING.         16

     LAURA stands there. She has the handgun at her side.

                         FERRARI
               Is the 801 ready?

                         CHITI
               There's the workers mass at nine.
               After that.

                          FERRARI
               I'll call Castellotti.
                   (hangs up, to Laura)
               Behra's here.

     FERRARI glances over his shoulder. He dials the long distance
     operator. Behind him is LAURA and the handgun. He didn't see
     it.

                         LAURA
               Really? So many phone calls. I
               thought Frank Sinatra came to town.

     FERRARI asks the operator for the Medici Hotel, Florence.

                          LAURA (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
               What do I tell them?
                   (singsong)
               Excuse me, please. My husband isn't
               here. He is out whoring. Grazie.
               Buongiorno!

     The hotel comes on the line.

                         FERRARI
               Signor Castellotti, please.

                         LAURA
               I don't give a damn who you screw,
               Enzo, or how many. The rule is that
               you have to be here before the maid
               arrives with the morning coffee.
               That was the agreement. Was it not?
                    6A.


          FERRARI
Laura, please!
                                                              7.


     LAURA's gestures include her had with the gun. She's
     interrupted by the arrival of the maid.

                         ALDA
               Buongiorno, Signora,
               Commendatore...

     ALDA pushes into the room carrying a tray with two espressos
     on it. She skirts LAURA, pushes aside the gun and places the
     tray on the table on which the phone rests.

     At this moment CASTELLOTTI comes on the line.

                         FERRARI
               Castellotti!


17   INT. A BEDROOM. THE MEDICI HOTEL. MORNING.                17

     Castellotti is in bed with his girlfriend, CECILLIA MANZINI.

                         CASTELLOTTI
               Enzo. Do you know what time it is?


18   INT. FERRARI'S SUITE. MORNING.                            18

                         FERRARI
               Can you be at the Modena Autodrome
               by eleven? Bring your lucky gloves.

                          CASTELLOTTI
                   (confused)
               What gloves?

                         FERRARI
               The gloves that will beat Behra who
               has come to steal from you our
               record.

                         ALDA
               Will that be all, Signora?

                         CASTELLOTTI
               I'll be there.

                         LAURA
               That will be all.
                                                               8.


     LAURA raises the gun.   ALDA exits.

     FERRARI puts down the phone.

                         FERRARI
               Laura, the car broke.

     The gun FIRES. Laura moved it slightly right. FERRARI dodges
     sideways.


19   EXT. PANORAMIC VIEW OF MODENA.                               19

     The bells of the Ghirlandia mask the sound of the shot.


20   INT. FERRARI HOUSE. FOYER. MORNING.                          20

     ALDA presents GIUSEPPE �- Ferrari's older driver -- with a
     glass of coffee.

                         ALDA
               Buongiorno, Giuseppe.

                         GIUSEPPE
               What's going on in there?

     He takes his coffee. There is a second shot.

                         ALDA
               Her gentleness, the Signora, is
               trying to shoot Il Commendatore...


21   INT. FERRARI'S SUITE. MORNING.                               21

     Then, LAURA lowers the gun and exits.

     FERRARI, a little shaken, regains his balance.


22   INT. FOYER. THE FERRARI HOUSE. MORNING.                      22

     LAURA makes her way to her suite, her robe swirling around
     her. Giuseppe, staring up at her.

                         LAURA
               Buongiorno, Giuseppe.

     LAURA sweeps through the foyer. To Giuseppe --

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               I let him live--
                                     8A.


FERRARI appears and shouts at her.
                                                            9.


                    FERRARI
          That gun was given to you for your
          protection.

ADALGISA FERRARI, Ferrari's ancient mother in black, appears
with her cane--

Before she disappears around the corner to the kitchen --

                    LAURA
          And, talk to Cuoghi. You're going
          broke--

She slams shut a door O.S.

FERRARI looks down at GIUSEPPE.

                    FERRARI
          Yes, I heard about Behra.

                    ADALGISA
          I knew it would come to this.

We SEE her now, a tough old woman with piercing eyes.

                    FERRARI
          Mama.

                    ADALGISA
          You give her a gun, she'll use it.

                    FERRARI
          She carries the pay roll for the
          factory around in that handbag.

                    ADALGISA
          I'd rearm Germany before I gave to
          that woman a gun.

FERRARI starts back to his room.

                    FERRARI
          Giuseppe will take you and Laura to
          the cemetery this morning.

ADALGISA continues as FERRARI leaves --

                    ADALGISA
          And don't forget the Workers Mass.
          Unless you want to pay high wages
          next year --

As he turns towards his rooms --
                                                              10.


                         FERRARI
               Be nice to Laura.

     LAURA returns. She has a bunch of flowers in her hand.

                         ADALGISA
               Good morning.

                         LAURA
               No one was hurt, okay?     So don't
               make a fuss.

                         ADALGISA
               What? What have I said?


23   INT. LAURA' S APARTMENT. FERRARI HOUSE. MORNING.           23

     From the window LAURA watches FERRARI cross the square below
     to the flower seller to buy a bouquet of yellow flowers.
     She's torn between her norms, anger and concern for him.


25   EXT. MODENA. STREET. DAY.                                  25

     A convoy of the Maserati transporter cars and vans rumbles
     through the masonry streets. It is the Maserati Works team.
     In the last car sit ADOLFO and OMER ORSI and BEHRA.

     Reveal, now, FERRARI, who crosses the cobbled street
     diagonally towards the Barber's, glancing after the convoy.


26   INT. BARBER'S. LARGO GARIBALDI. DAY.                       26

     As FERRARI enters there are greetings from several MEN
     reading their newspapers.

                         BARBER
               Morning, Commendatore...

     He ushers FERRARI into the empty seat. MATTEO, turns the page
     of his newspaper.

                         MATTEO
               Did you see who was in that car? It
               was Jean Behra.

                         FERRARI
               Don't panic, Matteo. If they take
               the record, we shall take it back.
                                                        11.


MATTEO's skeptical LAUGH. FERRARI looks through the mirror at
him.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          So, how did our football team do
          yesterday, Matteo?

                    MATTEO
          You know damn well. We lost.

                    FERRARI
          One long catalogue of disaster,
          it's been. How long since you took
          over?

MATTEO looks up sharply.

                    MATTEO
          And what about Le Mans? Jaguar one,
          two and three. What's that?

                     FERRARI
              (dismissive)
          From my mistakes I learn, whereas
          the mistakes you make, you repeat.
          Week after week. When you play
          Bologna, I hope you win.

Ferrari warms to his theme.

                     FERRARI (CONT'D)
              (searches for a suitable
               threat)
          Otherwise, I may relocate my
          factory to Bologna so my drivers
          will not be dispirited by living in
          a city whose football team dwells
          in the perpetual twilight of
          failure...

Laughter. FERRARI closes his eyes.

                    MATTEO
          The Modena Football Club is the
          pride of Emilia.

All the newspapers come down in protest. Matteo is defiant,
the object of everyone's scorn.
                                                             12.


24   EXT. THE CEMETERY. SAN CATALDO. DAY.                         24

     FERRARI walks with a bouquet of yellow flowers across the
     central courtyard of the cemetery.

     It is vast, enclosed on four sides by high walls. Built into
     the walls are elaborate mausoleums containing drawers which
     house the dust of Modena's families. It is monumental because
     death is monumentally remembered in Modena.


54   INT. THE FERRARI MAUSOLEUM. DAY.                             54

     FERRARI pulls up a chair to face a photograph and the
     engraved name "Alfredo Ferrari," who is buried in the wall.

     Dino died two years ago from muscular dystrophy. FERRARI sets
     in a vase in front of Dino's vault the yellow flowers--

                          FERRARI
               Cuoghi wants to meet. That means
               bad news--

     He leans forward, conversational, confiding--

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
               Your mother missed on purpose. One
               day she won't. Then I'll be in here
               with you.
                   (pause)
               Again, I'm hearing voices in my
               sleep. My brother and father. I see
               their faces, too. Also, now,
               Campari and Borzacchini, my good
               friends who died on the same day at
               Monza twenty-four years ago this
               week on that evil afternoon.
                   (pause)
               Ghosts.
                   (pause)
               There was a time I loved your
               mother beyond reason..
                   (beat)
               She was a different creature then
               But so was I.
                   (beat)
               And I see you, too. Every moment I
               close my eyes. That face, your
               face, I want to see.

     FERRARI kisses his hand and touches Dino's picture and his
     name.
                                                                 13.


                            FERRARI (CONT'D)
                  Okay. I go to deal with today.


A24     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE CEMETERY. DAY.                    A24

        FERRARI's getting into the Peugeot to drive away as the Fiat
        sedan pulls in. He nods to Laura and Giuseppe.

        LAURA ignores him and briskly exits into the cemetery.
        Giuseppe shrugs. FERRARI leaves.

        ADALGISA, slower-paced, extricates herself from the sedan,
        helped by GIUSEPPE. As they walk slowly towards the entry--

                            ADALGISA
                  Did I tell you of my son, Alfredo,
                  Enzo's older brother?

                            GIUSEPPE
                  Many times Signora.

        They walk for a few moments in silence.

                            ADALGISA
                  A tragedy, I lost him in the Great
                  War.

                            GIUSEPPE
                  Yes, Signora.

                            ADALGISA
                  Let me tell you...the wrong son
                  died.

        GIUSEPPE slows to a stop. ADALGISA sails on.


A25     INT. THE FERRARI MAUSOLEUM. SAN CATALDO. DAY.             A25

        Now LAURA stands with her flowers in front of Dino's tomb.
        The exhortation, which is to grace the roof, is traced in
        charcoal -- "Ad majorem ultra vitam."

        A small candle burns on the ground at LAURA'S feet. She
        stands there, immobile, grieving, melting...then she places
        her flowers in a separate vase adjacent to Enzo's.

        Meanwhile--


27-31   OMITTED                                                  27-31
                                                                14.


32   INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO CHURCH. MODENA. DAY.              32

     (MM ONLY: perhaps delay Ferrari's entry till just before
     Communion begins with the start of the music)

     FERRARI makes his way to the second or third row and slips in
     beside LAURA. Next to her is ADALGISA, then CUOGHI and
     RANCATI, a journalist, CHITI, Ferrari's Chief Engineer, and
     TAVONI, his assistant sit to the east, one row in front of
     FERRARI.

     The High Mass for all the MECHANICS AND WORKERS of the racing
     equipes of Modena is in full swing. The church is packed with
     TRADES UNIONS and COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS.

     About three quarters through the ceremony the PRIEST at the
     altar consecrates the Host with a Latin prayer and raises the
     wafer above the altar with two hands. One ALTAR BOY chimes a
     bell.

     Then, the PRIEST lowers the Host to the altar and raises the
     chalice of wine over his head with prayer and as the ALTAR
     BOY rings a bell --


33   EXT. THE PITS. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY.                   33

     The ROAR of the Maserati 250F engine as BEHRA revs it to
     bring fluids up to the correct temperature.

     With a great SHRIEK of rubber, Behra pilots the Maserati
     single-seater out of the pits. The acceleration and the smoke
     drifting from its tires demonstrate the power at Behra's
     disposal.

     ADOLFO and OMER ORSI, the men who own MASERATI, watch the
     Maserati pull away. The impression they make is of opulence
     in sleekness.


34   INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO CHURCH. MODENA. DAY.              34

     At the start of Communion the CHOIR launches into `Ave
     Verum', but although they are at full bore the sound of the
     Maserati can be picked up beyond the upper register: a series
     of screaming howls.

     FERRARI surreptitiously slides his stopwatch out of his
     pocket. He adjusts it to zero. His stopwatch is almost a
     physical appendage and is burnished with use. Further down
     the benches, TAVONI and CHITI remove theirs...
                                                               14A.


35   EXT. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY.                             35

     BEHRA begins to put the Maserati 250 through its paces. The
     car is all curves and squat purpose. As the Ave Verum wells
     up over the roar of its engine, it lends to the speeding car
     an aura of exultation.

     He tears by the pits, brakes and dinks through a little
     chicane, accelerating towards a long left hander.

     As it comes around this time, approaching the start/finish
     line, the engine howl increases, a MECHANIC points a revolver
     into the air.
                                                                15.


36   INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO CHURCH. MODENA. DAY.              36

     In the church the distant scream of the Maserati engine is
     heard. Stopwatches appear from pockets.

     And as the music rises at the end of Communion --


37   EXT. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY.                             37

     -- BEHRA blurs past the start-line. And the gun is FIRED--


38   INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO CHURCH. MODENA. DAY.              38

     At least forty stopwatches START. Their ticking works its way
     furiously into the Ave Verum.

     FERRARI concentrates on his pocket watch, without any attempt
     to pretend otherwise.


39   EXT. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY.                             39

     The ORSIS, like hooded crows, stare at their watches.

     BEHRA winds the 250 through the pasture racing at Turn #2.

     -- BEHRA's eyes, behind the oil-spattered goggles, are devoid
     of emotion. He measures his line for the corner--

     Against exultant sacred music, he and the Maserati are a
     picture of profane purpose, speed and noise.

     BEHRA enters the turn like Nuvolari. He takes an early apex,
     inducing the rear to drift out precisely so the 250 is aimed
     towards the long back straight. As the rear wheels regain
     full traction, he rockets forwards --


40   OMITTED                                                      40

42    INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO CHURCH, MODENA. DAY.           42

      The PRIEST addresses the crowded church--

                           PRIEST
                If Jesus had lived today, and not
                2,000 years ago, he would have been
                born in a small town like Modena.
                He would have been -- not a
                carpenter -- but a craftsman in
                metal. Like yourselves...
                    (beat)
                So a God who understood, as a
                carpenter, the perfection of the
                adze, appreciates as an engineer,
                the precision of your lathe, the
                nature of metal. How it can be
                forged, shaped and hammered by your
                skills into an engine holding
                inside it fire to make power to
                speed us through the world.
                    (beat)
                Which is why we give thanks to Him
                today.

      The PRIEST raises his hand to deliver the Final Blessing to
      the congregation --


42A   EXT. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY. (WAS SC. 41)            42A

      Out of Turn #4, Behra has red-lined the tachometer, rocketing
      towards the finish line.

      -- BEHRA flashes by the pits. ORSI fires the second gunshot.
      The MASERATI TEAM stopwatches shut the time away. Fixed
      forever. A new lap record that beats Ferrari's and--


42B   INT. PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGO. MODENA. DAY                   42B

      -- the stopwatches in church declare the same.

      [MM ONLY: B CAM see Chiti upset. Tavoni. But...]

      -- FERRARI'S blank stare -- which we will come to recognize
      often in defeat -- is what overtakes his face.

      -- Meanwhile the PRIEST's hand crosses his chest.
                                                            16A.

43   EXT. PIAZZA PARROCCHIA SAN BIAGIO. MODENA. DAY.              43

     FERRARI and his CLOSEST AIDES surge out of the church into
     the small cobblestone forecourt --

                         CHITI
               -- one thirty two point seven.

                          TAVONI
               I had one thirty two point nine.

                         ONLOOKER
               Signor Ferrari, a Maserati --

                         FERRARI
               Only for the moment.

                         ONLOOKER
               When do you propose to take it
               back?

                            FERRARI
               Right now.

     A small group - FERRARI and his AIDES - moves off with
     purpose.


44   EXT. THE AUTODROME. MODENA. DAY.                             44

     The Ferrari factory van is already in the pit area. Out of
     its back rolls Ferrari's 801 Monoposto. Lower than the
     Maserati and longer, it is a mean-looking machine.

     Arriving behind it is a 1957 Cadillac, a cabin cruiser with
     fins.

     CASTELLOTTI slides out, carrying his goggles and gloves. He
     escorts his beautiful girlfriend, CECILLIA. Together, they
     make their way towards FERRARI.

     In the pits, MECHANICS have the hood off the red 801 and are
     fine-tuning the engine. Its twelve cylinders vibrate in the
     morning air.

     CHITI tweaks the accelerator cable.

     Separating from FERRARI, CASTELLOTTI hoists himself into the
     cockpit, REVS THE ENGINE, checks instruments. The ROAR and
     sharp crack threaten to fracture cement--

                         FERRARI
               Until the tires warm up, take it
               easy, then put your foot down.
               She'll do 1:30 if given a chance.

     CASTELLOTTI nods cheerfully.

                          CASTELLOTTI
                   (impatient, SHOUTS)
               Look after Cecillia will you?

     FERRARI is distracted by this irrelevance but gives the woman
     a quick glance.

     CASTELLOTTI looks at BEHRA in the Maserati pits, and salutes
     him. BEHRA nods back.
                                                           18.


CASTELLOTTI accelerates out of the pit.

CECILLIA gives CASTELLOTTI a half-hearted wave, but doubts if
he saw it. She turns to see FERRARI, his hands hunched in his
long coat, studying her.

                     FERRARI
          Cecillia Manzini?
              (she nods; he places her)
          I knew your mother.

                     CECILLIA
          Did you?

But she already knew that. She looks away. Silence between
them. Interrupted by --

                    DE PORTAGO (V.O.)
          Signor Ferrari?

FERRARI's attention is taken by the scruffy DE PORTAGO in the
leather jacket with the formal demeanor--

                    DE PORTAGO
          I am Alfonso de Portago.

                    FERRARI
          We met on the Largo Garibaldi?

                    DE PORTAGO
          Yes sir. I was seeking to introduce
          myself --

                     FERRARI
          The light, it turned green --
              (shrugs)
          You bought one of my cars last year
          and won Tour de France.

                    DE PORTAGO
          Yes. Now, I'm looking for a works
          drive.

                    FERRARI
          I don't need another driver,
          Portago. But, if someone drops
          out --

FERRARI's eyes go back to the track as the 801 approaches and
rips by with shattering sound. DE PORTAGO nods and steps
back. The interview he sought is at an end.

FERRARI clocks the 801 as it speeds past the line. CHITI
chalks a time on board -- 1.41.
                                                          19.


It is later --

A chill mood has overtaken the pit area. The sky has become
overcast. CASTELLOTTI roars past again -- and again FERRARI
clocks the time, but it is slow...

                    CHITI
          How's he doing?

                       FERRARI
          He's slow.

We follow CASTELLOTTI round the track, past the sheep, across
the airstrip, down towards the houses, a left-hander taking
him alongside the Via Emilia, and then another back towards
the front straight and the pits.

The 801 flashes by... Again the time is two seconds short.

This time, DE PORTAGO walks onto the track, across from
FERRARI. He stoops to scrape up fresh liquid with his
forefinger. Still hot. He has FERRARI's eye.

                       FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Oil?

                    DE PORTAGO
          Brake fluid.

Almost immediately we HEAR the SHRIEK of rubber, brakes
locking, more SHRIEKING. They look round.

At the far end of the field...

ON CASTELLOTTI'S face for the briefest moment of surprise. No
brakes.

PAST LEFT FRONT TIRE OF 801 skidding, tire turned left,
RACING towards a concrete barrier which protects the corner
of the chicane. Completely CARTWHEELING, it hurtles into the
only piece of concrete on that side of the track -- a World
War II bunker that's become a stand with seats and a railing.
With colossal force outlying parts break away: wings, wheels
flying in all directions. CASTELLOTTI catapulted into the
air.

None of this can be seen from the spectators' viewpoint, only
the smoke now rising beyond the curve. There is a moment's
silence. Then the ENTIRE PIT STAFF runs across the concrete
track and the field;� towards it, their leather boots
thudding on the hard surface.

Behind FERRARI and CECILLIA, a WWII ambulance with its wheezy
siren lurches into motion.
                                                       19A.


As it passes CECILLIA it stops long enough to pull her and
CHITI on board, then it accelerates up the track towards the
black smoke.

DE PORTAGO stands transfixed, looking at the smoke.
                                                                20.

                  De Portago?

       DE PORTAGO turns to look at him.

                            FERRARI (CONT'D)

       A single light on. FERRARI is half-dressed. He has the
       Italian coffee pot apart and is looking for coffee.

       LINA appears in the kitchen.

                            LINA
                  Here, let me.

                            FERRARI
                  I woke you --

                               LINA
                  I was up.

                            FERRARI
                  Did I wake the boy?

       LINA shakes her head. The coffee has begun to DRIP through.
       They stand, wait, a moment, then--

                             LINA
                  I knew you wouldn't be able to
                  sleep.
                      (at his look)
                  -- you haven't said a word.

                            FERRARI
                  What is there to say? Newspapers,
                  the radio, they say it all--

                               LINA

                         LINA (CONT'D)
               Was he your friend, the young
               Castellotti? Was it the car's
               fault, his fault?

     FERRARI turns to her--

                         LINA (CONT'D)
               Will you miss him?

                         FERRARI
               Does that bring the boy back? Why
               do you push things like that?

                         LINA
               Why do you think? Because I know
               they matter to you.

                         FERRARI
               To me? Twenty four years ago this
               week I lost my friends. Borzacchini
               and Campari, scraped like dead
               animals across the concrete at
               Monza in metal I made. And, I knew
               then it was, Enzo, build a wall...

     NOTE: either "scraped" + "metal I made" play here or in
     Mausoleum, not both.

     FERRARI sees the coffee's ready. He fills a cup for her, and
     one for himself.

                         LINA
               Or?

                          FERRARI
                   (shrugs)
               Or, Enzo, go do something else.

     They remain standing, sipping their coffee, side by side.

     Then he covers her hand, which she wraps around his arm and
     turns to look at her, now, pulling her close. She knows
     turmoil goes on within him, behind the words. They weather it
     together, standing there.

                         LINA
               When you grieve for one, you grieve
               for them all.

46   INT. DINING ROOM. LARGO GARIBALDI. DAY.                   46

     ADALGISA sits at the table, reading the morning newspapers.

                         ADALGISA
               'Ferrari is an industrial Saturn
               devouring his own children... First
               Tornaco, now Castellotti...
                                                             22.


     FERRARI, dressed for the day ahead, has entered with a tray
     of coffee. She looks up with hostile eyes--

                         ADALGISA (CONT'D)
               If you continue killing the
               nation's heroes, we will have to go
               to America and live among
               foreigners.

     FERRARI puts her coffee on the table.

                         FERRARI
               I did not kill Castellotti.

                         ADALGISA
               The papers blame you.

                         FERRARI
               It wasn't me. If anyone... it was
               his mother.

     ADALGISA is taken aback.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               It's true. He was engaged to
               Cecillia Manzini. His mother wanted
               him to marry a woman with more
               class. As a result of the weight
               she put on his shoulders, he became
               distracted. He lost his
               concentration, crashed and died.

     ADALGISA looks out the window to the sky.

                         ADALGISA
               He blames the mother!

                         FERRARI
               What I am saying is, when a mother
               interferes in this business, death
               usually follows.

     Satisfied that he's sufficiently wound up his mother, FERRARI
     turns to go.

        LAURA's talking to CARLO, her accountant. She watches Ferrari
        in the square.

                            LAURA (CONT'D)
                  Call Chiti. I need a report on the

        She crosses into her adjoining office, a dark room dominated
        by a picture of Dino with a black shroud over the frame. A
        tenor voice, practicing, floats in the air from the opera
        house next door.

                            LAURA (CONT'D)
                  And call the lawyers... These
                  journos have gone too far in their

                            CARLO

55      INT. THE MODENA RAILWAY STATION. CASTELLOTTI'S CASKET. DAY.
                                                                  55

        It's draped in black.

        It's at the front of a funeral cortege. Following the casket
        is Castellotti's mother, a dignified older woman with a
        silver topped cane, supported by her aristocratic family.

        The distant view of the cortege is the PERSPECTIVE of--

        FERRARI -- here after all. Hidden by steel pillars and
        luggage trolleys near the station bar, separated by three
        platforms from the cortege. He's there ti make his own
        farewell to Castellotti.

        CASTELLOTTI'S casket is preceded by a slow-marching BAND.

        CASTELLOTTI'S CORTEGE is not a proletarian affair. He was a
        child of the glittering Roman aristocracy. Mourners are in
        black silk, leather, extravagantly coiffured. All quite alien
        to the stolid burghers of Modena watching it proceed.
                                                         24.


Now, FERRARI sees CECILLIA in a black dress and long veil.
She's at the end of the cortege, devastated by grief -- but
her sensuality undeniable in black.

A WELL-DRESSED MAN -- turns back from the CASTELLOTTI FAMILY
and makes a small, discreet gesture to CECILLIA to stop.

FERRARI's POV: CECILLIA AND WELL-DRESSED MAN

The MAN intercepts her. We're some distance away, so their
exchange isn't entirely clear. Its meaning is. With great
charm --

                     WELL-DRESSED MAN
           The Castellotti Family think it
           best that you don't make the
           journey to Rome...

As if she'd been struck --

                     CECILLIA
           Scusi?

                     WELL-DRESSED MAN
           Don't you agree?

She stares at him. Then, surprised at herself, she nods yes.
The victim of a thousand years of class subordination.

                     WELL-DRESSED MAN (CONT'D)
           There is also the matter of several
           pieces of...

NOISES of the train preparing to leave now prevent our
hearing all the words...

Ferrari watches. The pantomime is clear: CECILLIA removes a
gold watch/bracelet from her wrist, a necklace, a pendant...
hands them to him. After which he touches his hand to the
brim of his hat, turns and joins the others on the train.

CECILLIA is frozen, motionless -- until she senses someone
watching.

CECILLIA'S POV: FERRARI

He is across the tracks, motionless.

CECILLIA

Her gaze rests on him a moment. Then she turns, walks back
through the STEAM of the departing Funeral Train... out of
the station.
                                                              25.

      He finds the right room number, KNOCKS. A moment.

                Who is it?

                             FERRARI
                Ferrari.

      A moment. The door opens. Blonde CECILLIA still wears the
      veil, but pushed back. She looks briefly to find his eyes,
      then away.

                             CECILLIA
                Come in.


57    INT. HOTEL ROOM. CECILLIA'S ROOM. EVENING                    57

      Her raw grief replaced by anger, CECILLIA is both edgy and
      without navigation...no plans for tomorrow or the years to
      come.

                          CECILLIA
                Would you like some wine?

      Doesn't wait for an answer; pours two glasses. We HEAR the
      RATTLE of early air-conditioning. Abruptly--

                          CECILLIA (CONT'D)
                You were at the station.

                          FERRARI
                To see him off.

                          CECILLIA
                Why were you not with the cortege?

                          FERRARI
                I don't like ceremonies.

                          CECILLIA
                Maybe you don't grieve--

                          FERRARI
                Maybe you don't know anything about
                me.

      She drinks half her wine--
                                                        26.


                    CECILLIA
          They took the jewelry. Did you see?
          A ring, a bracelet, even a little
          enamel pendant cost 20 lire he gave
          me.

                    FERRARI
          ...Why did you give it back?

                    CECILLIA
          They are who they are.

                    FERRARI
          Do they have the right?

                    CECILLIA
          How would I know? His family goes
          back to ancient Rome!

                    FERRARI
          Yes. And they're all a tight-assed
          bunch.

Her first smile. She raises her glass. He raises his.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Here's to Castellotti.

                    CECILLIA
          A pain in the ass, but I loved him.
          We had so much fun.

They drink, she looks away. For all her toughness, she seems
lost within.

He spots the half-packed case on the bed.

                    FERRARI
          Where are you going?

                    CECILLIA
          I can't pay the hotel bill.

                    FERRARI
          What will you do?

                    CECILLIA
          I don't know.

                    FERRARI
          In our eyes you were married to
          him, so you're due what we extend
          to next of kin. And we'll help you
          into something.

          In the meantime have them send to
          us the hotel bill.

CECILLIA is unprepared for his generosity. After a pause--
                                                             27.

               Newspapers say I distracted him, I

                         FERRARI
               They say I killed him too. But we
               both know who's responsible.

                         CECILLIA
               His mother?

                            FERRARI
               Of course.

     She smiles, then the bittersweet tears begin.

     He kisses her paternally, turns away to leave.

     FERRARI - leaving - feels her touch on his shoulder. He turns
     back. She folds into his arms. She doesn't want to be alone.

                         CECILLIA
                   (low)
               I don't want to be alone.

     His hand reaches for the zipper on the back of her long black
     dress--

     Rain pours down.

     The gates of the factory swing open. There is a low roll of
     thunder split by the shriek of a downshifting V12. A mud
     plastered sports car roars in with its top down and temporary
     plates.

     The rain-drenched gatekeeper keeps open the gates for the
     humble Peugeot. It bowls in and comes to a halt.

     FERRARI gets out of the Peugeot. GIUSEPPE runs over with a

     FERRARI leans into the DRIVER, half-drowned behind the wheel.

                         FERRARI
               Why is the damn top down?

                         TEST DRIVER
               I didn't want to get it wet.

     The rain is pouring down, monsoon-style.

                         FERRARI
               It belongs to King Hussein. Get it
               inside! Make sure the cockpit's dry
               before you hand it over --

                          TEST DRIVER
                   (cheerfully)
               Yes, sir, Commendatore.

     The car accelerates away, heading for the Finishing Shop.

     The King sticks his head out of the gatehouse.

                            HUSSEIN
               Ferrari!!

     FERRARI holds his hands out in
     greetings/supplication/apology, interpret them as you may.

     TAVONI holds open the door to the office block. He follows
     FERRARI inside.

     As FERRARI enters --
                                                             29.


                          FERRARI
               Stall the King and tell them to get
               a move on in the shop.
                   (beat)
               Cuoghi, is he inside?

64   INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. DAY.                               64

     FERRARI enters; CUOGHI rises. He's snappy, dapper and short.
     He and Ferrari have been friends since school.

     The room is starkly functional with no hint of paperwork. The
     huge desk is bare except for a photograph of Dino and a vase
     of fresh flowers.

                              FERRARI
                     (nods)
               So?

                         CUOGHI
               You're going broke. Laura's right.

                              FERRARI
               How?

                         CUOGHI
               "How?" You spend more than you
               make. That's how.

                         FERRARI
               The production cars pay for the
               racing.

                         CUOGHI
               I could run Portugal on what you
               spend on racing. How many
               production cars did you make last
               year?

                         FERRARI
               One hundred forty, one hundred
               fifty...

                         CUOGHI
               Ninety eight.

                         FERRARI
               One hundred, ninety eight.
                                                30.


                    CUOGHI
          No. Ninety. Eight.

FERRARI pauses.

                    FERRARI
          So, what do I do?

                    CUOGHI
          Find a partner.

                    FERRARI
          I have a partner. My wife. She is
          very mean with money.

                    CUOGHI
          A real partner. Like Agnelli at
          Fiat or Henry Ford, someone who has
          capital to pump in.

FERRARI doesn't like the idea.

                    FERRARI
          Impossible. With money they want
          control. I must have total control.

                    CUOGHI
          The right partner would help with
          the production cars -- while you
          remain the boss and do as you like
          with the racing.

                    FERRARI
          It sounds too simple.

                     CUOGHI
          It is not simple. It is impossible.
          Because you are too small to
          negotiate those terms. You have to
          increase production to four hundred
          customer cars a year. Then, maybe,
          you're attractive and can
          negotiate.

                    FERRARI
          How do we make, nevermind how do we
          sell, four hundred customer cars a
          year?

CUOGHI goes to the window.
                                                             31.


65   CUOGHI'S POV. THE YARD. FACTORY GATE. MARANELLO. DAY.     65

     He sees HUSSEIN standing at the window of Reception, looking
     determined.

                         CUOGHI (V.O.)
               Jaguar took the first three places
               at Le Mans. Now their order books
               are full. You win on Sunday; you
               sell on Monday.

                         FERRARI (V.O.)

               Last year we won 5 out of 8 Grand
               Prix. So--?

                         CUOGHI (V.O.)
               Do customers buy single seat Grand
               Prix cars or sports cars?


66   INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. MARANELLO. DAY.                    66

     CUOGHI turns away from the window to FERRARI.

                         CUOGHI
               They buy sports cars. Win the Mille
               Miglia. Italy's sports car race.
               You can sell as many as you can
               build. You already have kings
               waiting in line...

     Meanwhile...


67   INT. OUTER OFFICE. MARANELLO. DAY.                        67

     DE PORTAGO enters. TOMMASO looks up at him. Marlon Brando in
     a scruffy leather jacket. He hands him a card with regal
     formality.

                         DE PORTAGO
               I am Alfonso de Portago, I have an
               appointment with Signor Ferrari.

     Meanwhile...


68   INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. FACTORY. MARANELLO. DAY.           68

                         FERRARI
               Jaguar races to sell cars. I sell
               cars only to be racing. We are
               different organisms.
                                                           32.


                         CUOGHI
               Survive or you are no organism.

                         FERRARI
               I have a choice?

                          CUOGHI
                   (quietly)
               Win the Mille Miglia, Enzo. Attract
               real finance...

     CUOGHI collects his gloves and hat.

                          CUOGHI (CONT'D)
               The world's changing. Racing's on
               television. Advertising. Sponsors.
               That means more competitors....
               which means more technology, more
               development which means you need
               money. Lots of it.
                   (beat)
               You seize the future, Enzo. Or you
               are out of business.

     And CUOGHI is out the door before FERRARI replies--


69   INT. OUTER OFFICE. DAY.                                 69

     CUOGHI crosses through.

                         DE PORTAGO (V.O.)
               Signor Ferrari?

     FERRARI, following Cuoghi, sees DE PORTAGO.

                          TOMMASO
                   (impressed)
               This is Don Alfonso de Cabeza Vaca,
               the 11th Marquis de Portago.

                         FERRARI
               I know who it is. Cuoghi--

                          DE PORTAGO
                   (affronted)
               Hey, Ferrari--

     He follows FERRARI who's following CUOGHI.
                                                             33.


70   EXT. OFFICE BLOCK ALLEYWAY TO YARD. DAY.                  70

     Before FERRARI can ask--

                          CUOGHI
                   (turns...)
               One more thing. How did Laura get
               her hands on the freehold to the
               plant?

                         FERRARI
               The Nazis were about to arrest me.
               I put it in her name along with
               half the shares. We built it
               together.

                         CUOGHI
               Get it back. If you face up to
               Agnelli or Ford, you have to hold
               all the cards.

                          FERRARI
               Easier said than done.
                   (Cuoghi continues down)
               One more thing --

     As they exit and enter the yard--


71   EXT. THE YARD. DAY.                                       71

                           HUSSEIN
               Ferrari!

     HUSSEIN and Two Aides enter from Reception across the yard.

                         FERRARI
               Your majesty.

     As they start across the yard, CUOGHI laughs, referring to
     Ferrari's customer base of kings, and, getting into his car -
     -

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                   (to Cuoghi)
               If I'm in bad shape, what of
               Maserati?

                         CUOGHI
               Worse. I give them six months.
               They've gone to the French for
               finance. And they, too, will try to
               prove themselves at the Mille
               Miglia.
                         (MORE)
                                     33A.

          CUOGHI (CONT'D)
Everyone's eye will be on it. Only
one team will win. Make sure it's
you.
                                                             34.


     He drives away, DE PORTAGO enters.

                           DE PORTAGO
                Ferrari!

                          FERRARI
                Your Highness --

                          DE PORTAGO
                Which Highness?

     FERRARI points at HUSSEIN.

                           FERRARI
                That Highness.
                    (to de Portago)
                You. Get out to the track.

     FERRARI turns to HUSSEIN.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Your majesty, come this way.

                          HUSSEIN
                I hope you got my measurements
                right. Last time my feet could
                barely touch the pedals.

74   EXT. APRON. AUTODROME TEST TRACK. LATER. DAY.                74

     TAVONI and his MECHANICS are clocking DE PORTAGO driving laps
     in an 801. FERRARI joins them. The rain has stopped but the
     track is still wet.

     DE PORTAGO in the red 801 single seater races past, TAVONI
     thumbs his stopwatch, FERRARI looks at the lap time. The
     result meets with an understated approval.

                          FERRARI
                How long's he been going like this?

                          TAVONI
                One warm up lap, then ever since.
                                                       34A.


DE PORTAGO brakes on the wet for a left hander, feels the car
understeer and plane to the right. He steers into it, regains
traction, turns in and is through the left turn.
                                                           35.


FERRARI from the far side of the track hears the engine
howling up through the gears. Nearer, he hears the click of a
camera. He turns --

-- a LITHE BLONDE, the film star LINDA CHRISTIAN, sits on the
hood of a two-seater, taking photos of the 801 through a long
lens.

Sensing that she's being watched, she gives FERRARI an
interrogative stare. He doesn't react. She carefully snaps
him and nods before returning to frame the fast approaching
DE PORTAGO.

FERRARI admires her boldness. The 801 roars past, feet from
them. In a swirl of mist and spray FERRARI looks at his
watch. To TAVONI--

                    FERRARI
          He reminds me of Varzi.

TAVONI gives him a quick look. Varzi got through a lot of
cars.

The Ferrari comes in. DE PORTAGO gets out. He is given a
towel and wipes the rain from his neck and face.

FERRARI approaches--

                    DE PORTAGO
          Well, how did I do?

                    FERRARI
          You drive like Varzi...

                    DE PORTAGO
          Does that mean I'm hired?

                    FERRARI
          Your duties will include testing
          and road racing.

                    DE PORTAGO
          The Mille Miglia?

FERRARI nods.

                    FERRARI
          You'll drive a works 250. Not the
          most powerful car in the race, but
          reliable and it goes like hell
          round corners, so I will expect you
          to be in the points.

DE PORTAGO nods. FERRARI moves closer--
                                                                36.


                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Actresses--

      He points at the LITHE BLONDE.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                I have admiration, but keep them
                away from the paddock. They
                distract photographers. I want
                their attention on my cars. You
                understand?

      DE PORTAGO nods.

A76   INT. THE CAVALINO RESTAURANT. MARANELLO.                   A76

      A crowd of factory workers, drivers and engineers mill around
      the entrance. The confusion is made worse by a cluster of
      kids with autograph books, waiting to pounce on their
      favorite drivers. One is PIERO. FERRARI, DE PORTAGO and
      TAVONI pull up and get out.

      FERRARI catches sight of COLLINS talking to a mechanic.

                           FERRARI
                Peter--

      COLLINS waits, surrounded by kids, shouting "me, me, me" as
      he signs autographs

      FERRARI puts an arm roughly around COLLINS. His affection for
      Collins is special. Collins spent many nights at Dino
      Ferrari's bedside when he was failing. After Dino died,
      Ferrari gave him Dino's house in Maranello.

                           COLLINS
                Hi Fon--

                           FERRARI
                    (to Collins)
                Look after our new driver. He's wet
                and hungry.

                           PIERO
                Papa.

      FERRARI looks down at PIERO holding up his autograph book.

                          PIERO (CONT'D)
                Get his autograph.
                                                            36A.


                         FERRARI
               Whose? Collins?

                         PIERO
               De Portago's.

     FERRARI takes the book from his son. DE PORTAGO and COLLINS
     have already disappeared into the restaurant.

     He looks down but the small boy has vanished.

     FERRARI works the crowded room. He is specific about to whom
     he talks. With locals it's in Modenese dialect. We SEE the
     more animated gestures.

     Food is plentiful, bowls of pasta, huge trolleys of boiled
     meats, Lambrusco foaming into sturdy tumblers, the early
     cherries...

     In the background COLLINS leads DE PORTAGO into a private
     room.

77   INT. PRIVATE ROOM. CAVALINO RESTAURANT. DAY.                 77

     COLLINS, steering DE PORTAGO, introduces him around the table
     of YOUNG MEN--

                         COLLINS
               Fon, meet Mike Hawthorn, the future
               World Champion. Olivier Gendebien,
               the best sports car driver in the
               world. Taruffi, the oldest. Chiti,
               the best engineer but always
               anxious. And Bizzarini, working on
               a project we are not allowed to
               discuss.

     He turns to DE PORTAGO.

                         DE PORTAGO
               Arrivaderci Maserati.
                                                                 37.


        They all laugh.

        FERRARI enters and works the crowded room. He is quite
        specific about to whom he talks. With locals it's in Modenese
        dialect.

        At which point a great trolley of boiled meats is brought
        into the private room.

                            HAWTHORN (O.S.)
                  So, de Portago, why come to this
                  neck of the woods when everyone
                  knows the future of chassis
                  technology with rear engines is in
                  England?

        Everybody protests.

        FERRARI enters and takes his place at the side of the table.
        He never sits at the head.

        FERRARI has heard it all before, dismisses the English and
        their mid-engined Coopers as 'Garagistes' and proclaims the
        supremacy of the front-engined racing car.

                            FERRARI
                  The ox must pull the cart. What we
                  need is more power. You hear that,
                  Chiti?

        DE PORTAGO, happy to be in the middle of this group of
        raucous men, listens to every word.


78-81   OMITTED                                                  78-81


82      EXT. FRONT OF CASTELVETRO FARM. LATE AFTERNOON.             82

        FERRARI is confronted by the orchard in full bloom.

        LINA clings to a ladder, snipping off the unwanted shoots.
        Where she has been working, the grass is carpeted with
        blossoms. FERRARI lifts her down from the ladder and kisses
        her perfunctorily. Her free hand encircles his neck and she
        takes off his dark glasses. He pulls her to him and rotates,
        leaning his back against the tree trunk. He relaxes with the
        relief of someone who has had to structure responses for far
        too long.

        She laughs.

                            FERRARI
                  What's so funny?
                                                                38.


                          LINA
                I wondered when you'd be back.

                          FERRARI
                How can I stay away? It's the
                cherries.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Where's Piero?

                           LINA
                On his way home from school.
                    (beat)
                He asked me yesterday.

                          FERRARI
                What?

                          LINA
                Am I Piero Lardi or Piero Ferrari?

      They look at each other -- a shared distress. They enter the
      house.


83    EXT. A ROAD. THE FARM. CASTEVETRO. LATE AFTERNOON.           83

      PIERO on a green bicycle, up the driveway, sees the Peugeot
      and jumps off the bike and races towards the house: Ferrari
      must be here.

      PIERO runs up the drive.


A84   INT. KITCHEN. THE FARM. CASTELVETRO. LATE AFTERNOON         A84

      LINA, in an apron with a towel, is making tortellini, she
      hears the door. She enters the hallway. Piero runs by her
      into the dining room.


84    INT. DINING ROOM. THE FARM CASTELVETRO. LATE AFTERNOON.      84

      FERRARI is in his shirt and suspenders at the table, looking
      over two blueprints of an engine. PIERO bursts in --

                          PIERO
                Papa, have you got it?

                           FERRARI
                    (remembers)
                The autograph. No, he hasn't had a
                proper picture taken yet.
                  38A.


          LINA
What autograph?
                                                        39.


                    PIERO
          De Portago. From Spain.

                     FERRARI
              (to Lina, over his
               shoulder)
          He's going to drive for me.

PIERO suddenly hugs FERRARI. Done impulsively, without self
consciousness.

We SEE FERRARI's surprise and pleasure... and something more
complicated.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Why do you like him so much?

                    PIERO
          He drives like Varsi. I'm going to
          be a driver -- like you!

                    FERRARI
          No, no, not like me. I only won two
          races.

Back to his blueprints, FERRARI compares a sharp curve inside
an intake manifold with a new blueprint and draws a circle
around a shallower curve. Initials it. PIERO rests his chin
on his small fist.

                     FERRARI (CONT'D)
              (initiates)
          This is much better.

                    PIERO
          Why?

                    FERRARI
          Okay. Pretend you're inside this
          engine. You are tiny, like an ant.
          Right here. Look up. What do you
          see?

                    PIERO
          A big tunnel.

LINA returns with crockery and a salad bowl, but hesitates,
observing from the doorway.

                    FERRARI
          Like a pipe, yes? Pretend water
          races through. And, when it hits
          the side?
                                     39A.


          PIERO
Some will splash sideways.

          FERRARI
But if we make the curve more,
gentle, more slippery. Like water,
fuel and air will move faster.
          (MORE)
                                                         40.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          And that is all an engine does:
          moves fuel in, sparks it into
          rapidly expanding gases, moves old
          gases out, new fuel in. Faster it
          can do that, the more power you can
          make.

During the above LINA comes forward with the salad and
settings.

                     PIERO
              (looking over the re-drawn
               galleries)
          It looks better.

                     FERRARI
              (pleased by the insight)
          In all life, when a thing works
          better, usually it is more
          beautiful to the eye.

PIERO picks up his backpack and heads upstairs:

LINA comes from behind and kisses the top of his head.

                    LINA
          Will we have supper together?

                    FERRARI
          I'll sit with you and Piero... I
          have business.

                    LINA
          Will you come back after?

                    FERRARI
          It depends. I'll try.

                    LINA
          Depends on what?

                    FERRARI
          How the business with her goes.

That kind of answer turns her mood. She sets out the last
crockery noisily-- He gets up. She has to move around him
briskly.

                    LINA
          I'm too easy.

                    FERRARI
          What do you mean?
                                      41.


          LINA
Too modern. I should give you lots
of shit like a normal Italian
woman.

          FERRARI
I prefer you like you are.

           LINA
Oh, I'm sure you do.
    (beat)
What I should become is the
mistress: "Oh, Enzo! I feel so bad.
Give me a fur coat and a diamond
bracelet..."
    (unspoken "now")
    (shouts upstairs)
Piero!
    (to Enzo, curt)
Sit down.
    (she laughs)
Don't worry, I don't plan to change
who I am.

             FERRARI
    (sits)
Thank you.

          LINA
"Thank you?" For nothing. It's not
for you.

          FERRARI
Do you know what is the hardest
part of my life with you?

          LINA
Zero. There is none.

             FERRARI
There is.

             LINA
What?

           FERRARI
Being away.
    (beat)
While with me? What do the English
say? A piece of pie?

          LINA
Cake, Enzo. And, you're not.
                                                             42.


85   INT. DINING ROOM. LARGO GARIBALDI. EVENING.                 85

     FERRARI opens a bottle of Lambrusco. LAURA at the far end of
     the table is scanning the figures left by Cuoghi. She looks
     different, a touch of makeup.

     FERRARI pours the Lambrusco, foaming into his glass -- then
     crosses to the other end of the table to pour a glass for
     LAURA. It's done with the patience of long routine and with a
     certain formality.

     The maid, ALDA, ladles raviolini into two soup dishes, hands
     them to FERRARI, who places one by LAURA and takes the other
     to his end of the table.

     Next door, the orchestra is rehearsing the overture to La
     Traviata.

                         FERRARI
               Thank you, Alda.

     ALDA nods and leaves.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               I saw Cuoghi today. He says our
               days are numbered unless we find a
               partner.

     LAURA looks up.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               One of the big companies, Fiat --
               or Ford.

                         LAURA
               You've never had a boss. You won't
               like it.

     FERRARI doesn't contest this.

                         FERRARI
               In order to attract this partner he
               says we have to expand. He's
               talking about building four hundred
               cars a year.

                         LAURA
               And how do we sell 400 cars a year?

                         FERRARI
               We have to win the Mille Miglia.
               Then orders for sports cars will
               follow.
                                                43.


                    LAURA
          This man knows contract law. What
          does he know about motor racing?
          The Mille Miglia. A thousand miles
          across regular roads with sheep and
          dogs. Anything can happen.

He looks at her, says nothing.

                       LAURA (CONT'D)
          What else?

                    FERRARI
          You should assign me control of
          your stock in the company and the
          freehold.

                    LAURA
          Because Henry Ford won't deal with
          a woman?

                    FERRARI
          No. Because if it comes to a deal,
          it will be hard and fast. I have to
          have all the cards in my hand.

                    LAURA
          Half the cards are in my hand.

                    FERRARI
          What do I say? Mr. Ford we have a
          deal, but, first it must wait until
          I ask my wife for permission.

                       LAURA
          Yes.

LAURA thinks further... eventually looks up.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          Okay, so you can deal, I'll give
          you power of attorney over my
          stock.

FERRARI nods, relieved.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          In return for half a million
          dollars.

She goes back to the raviolini.

                    FERRARI
          I don't have half a million!
                                                         44.


                    LAURA
          You will if you make a deal.

It's FERRARI's turn to consider--

                    FERRARI
          Okay, I will give you a cheque.
          Post dated.

                    LAURA
          Not post dated.

                    FERRARI
          I will give you a cheque on
          condition that you promise me you
          will not cash it until and unless
          the deal goes through.

LAURA is not too happy about this.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Is that reasonable?

LAURA looks at him, still unsure.

He gets up from the table, comes down to her end.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Is that reasonable? We need this.

She stands up. Face to face. Glaring. Inches from him.

Then, she smiles. The "la donna buffa" he met 30 years ago is
suddenly in the room.

                    LAURA
          One other condition.

                    FERRARI
          What?

                    LAURA
          I want my gun back.

FERRARI laughs.

Their mouths meet in a passionate kiss. He grabs her and
lifts her onto the table. Her legs wrap around him. She claws
at his back. There's something primal, almost savage to the
two of them together.
                                                             45.


86   INT. LAURA'S APPARTMENT/BEDROOM. NIGHT.                   86

     Both of them are on the bed, half-clothed.

     She's smoking. FERRARI, untrousered, looks for his glasses.

                         LAURA
               Did you sign de Portago?

                            FERRARI
               Yes.

                         LAURA
               I'll draw up a contract.

                         FERRARI
               And I need money for Cecillia
               Manzini.

                            LAURA
               How much?

                         FERRARI
               Twenty-five thousand.

     This brings LAURA up short. He finds his glasses. She looks
     at him.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               She's broke -- her mother told me.

                            LAURA
               Poor girl.

     LAURA's eyes are blazing.

                         LAURA (CONT'D)
               Her mother? Have you been screwing
               her mother?

                         FERRARI
               What? Are you crazy. I want 25,000
               dollars, in cash!

                         LAURA
               You've been screwing the mother and
               the daughter!

                         FERRARI
               We have obligations to that family!

                         LAURA
               So sympathetic!
                         45A.


And it starts again...
                                                             46.


88   INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. MARANELLO FACTORY. DAY.            88

     FERRARI reads a newspaper.

     TAVONI is going through a box file of journalists in
     preparation for a forthcoming press conference, attaching
     reporters' file cards to specific press clippings attacking
     Ferrari, blaming him for Castellotti's death.

     In contrast, FERRARI is distracted by...

                         FERRARI
               He's dating Linda Christian.

                         TAVONI
               Who is?

                         FERRARI
               De Portago. That blonde who follows
               him around. Tyrone Power left Rita
               Hayworth for her. She left Tyrone
               Power for De Portago.

     FERRARI lays the newspaper down or shows it briefly to Tavoni
     or none of those.

                         TAVONI
               What are you reading, Commendatore?

                         FERRARI
               'Rome Merry Go Round'.

                         TAVONI
               Want me to talk to Fon?

                          FERRARI
               How do you talk to him? He's got a
               permanent erection. I don't know
               how he manages to get around the
               circuit without breaking it off.
                   (he looks up)
               What's on the schedule after the
               press conference?

                          TAVONI
                   (itemizing)
               A photo call. Chiti's outside.
                   (he hands Enzo a dyno
                    report)
               This evening is the opera.

                         FERRARI
               Send in Chiti.
                                               46A.


FERRARI looks up.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          I've got two words for you, Chiti.
          More. Power.
                                                                47.


     CHITI looks at TAVONI, who shakes his head.

     Defeated, CHITI withdraws as...

                         TAVONI
               Next year we will have the new
               engine.

                          FERRARI
                   (snaps)
               Next year? We need it next week in
               Rouen.

                          TOMMASO
                   (enters; taps watch)
               Commendatore -- the Press
               Conference.

                         TAVONI
               Here's who will be there.

     TAVONI gestures towards the clipped articles now in front of
     FERRARI.

     FERRARI'S focus, now, looking forward to this...

                         TAVONI (CONT'D)
               I will exclude Di Massimo and
               Fusaro. They're the worst.

                         FERRARI
               No, no. I want them there.

     ...for FERRARI's premeditated and undisclosed intention.


89   EXT. THE YARD. FERRARI FACTORY. DAY.                         89

     FERRARI enters from the office block as a red 315 MM (Mille
     Miglia) race car, fresh from a test in the mountains, roars
     into the yard. Grey-haired TARUFFI -- veteran of a thousand
     races -- climbs out. He is known as The Fox.

                         FERRARI
               So, what do you think?

     TARUFFI frowns.

                         TARUFFI
               There's no ashtray.

                         FERRARI
               Are you a prima donna?
                                      47A.


          TARUFFI
You tried flicking ash out of a car
at two hundred kilometers an hour?

          FERRARI
I'm offering you a brand new car,
which has the edge on the Maserati.
                                                        48.


                    TARUFFI
          Bullshit. The Maserati is faster.
          And it has an ashtray--

                    FERRARI
          If I put in an ashtray, will you
          drive it in the Mille Miglia?

TARUFFI nods.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Good. And don't ask me for a
          navigator. You know every
          kilometer. You've raced it sixteen
          times.

He's drowned out as two red 335 MM sports racers also thunder
into the yard, muddied after their morning run.

DE PORTAGO and COLLINS lever themselves out, exhilarated.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Get all these cleaned up before the
          photo-call.

FERRARI indicates DE PORTAGO's car.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          How'd she handle?

                    DE PORTAGO
          Good.

                    FERRARI
          This is not "how was lunch? Good?"
          I want to know brake wear. I want
          steering, suspension, gear ratios,
          final drive. If it's to run in the
          Mille Miglia, it's got to be one
          hundred percent.

He moves on leaving DE PORTAGO hot and humiliated.

On the far side of the yard, a bunch of auto-journalists --
in a designated space -- see FERRARI approach and applaud. An
explosive mixture of enthusiasts and rumor mongers. FERRARI's
eye catches one of the worst offenders. He smiles --

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Di Massimo? I am not "an assassin"

                    DI MASSIMO
          It was a figure of speech,
          Commendatore.
                                                             49.


                         FERRARI
               Out!

     FERRARI didn't want them excluded in advance so that he could
     eject them himself.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               Fusaro, you said I was Saturn
               devouring his young children.

                         FUSARO
               I was merely quoting the Vatican,
               Commendatore.

                         FERRARI
               You, too, out. And you, Moretti. A
               'widowmaker'? For the record
               Castellotti was not married. Okay?
               Out!

     The three men leave and the rest, visibly chastened, don't
     want to be evicted. FERRARI's eyes pan along their ranks.
     They flinch.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               When we win, I can't see my cars
               for shots of starlets' asses. When
               we lose, you're a lynch mob. It's
               enough to make the Pope weep.

     There is uproar. FERRARI has to shout.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               Pay attention. This is the line up
               for the French Grand Prix at Rouen
               and for the Mille Miglia the
               following week.


90   INT. THE BANK. MODENA. DAY.                                  90

                         COSETTI
               Twenty three, twenty four, twenty
               five...

     LAURA sits in the BANK MANAGER's office. The Bank Manager,
     COSETTI, finishes counting the 50,000 dollars, in lire and
     pushes it across to her.

                         COSETTI (CONT'D)
               How do you want me to itemize this?

     LAURA begins to stuff the wads of notes into her bag.
                                                      49A.


COSETTI has open one of four large Ferrari ledgers.
                                                              50.


                          LAURA
                As a bequest to Signora Manzini to
                buy a property.

     He nods.

                          LAURA (CONT'D)
                She will have the use of it, but
                we'll retain the freehold.

                          COSETTI
                The same arrangement as in
                Castelvetro...

                          LAURA
                Castelvetro?

     COSETTI adopts a look of confusion.

                          LAURA (CONT'D)
                We have a property in Castelfranco.

                          COSETTI
                Yes, yes. I'm sorry -- I got the
                towns confused --

     LAURA starts to close her bag, but instead extends over his
     desk and glances at an upside down entry in the ledger.

                          LAURA
                I'll also need a banker's order,
                for a new driver. His name is de
                Portago.

                          COSETTI
                How do you spell that?

                          LAURA
                d .. e .... P ... o ... r ...

     COSETTI leans forward and writes down the name. It had been a
     narrow escape.


91   EXT. BANK. MODENA. DAY.                                    91

     LAURA walks towards the Alfa. GIUSEPPE opens the door.

                          LAURA
                Castelvetro.

     GIUSEPPE nearly has a heart attack but recovers.
                                                               51.


                          GIUSEPPE
                As her gentleness the Signora
                commands...


92    EXT. THE YARD. PRESS CONFERENCE. FERRARI FACTORY. DAY.     92

                          FERRARI
                Next. Let me introduce my Spring
                Team for the Mille Miglia.

      Journalists and photographers now at the five Ferraris
      destined for the Mille Miglia. The drivers, COLLINS, VON
      TRIPS, GENDEBIEN, TARUFFI and DE PORTAGO stand beside them.


      FERRARI introduces DE PORTAGO proudly to the photographers.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                This is de Portago, Castellotti's
                replacement. He drives like
                Varzi...

                           JOURNALIST
                    (to de Portago)
                Hey Fon, is it true about Linda
                Christian? She's your girlfriend?

      The subject diverting from his race cars, Ferrari's
      expression turns dark.


93    EXT. CASTELVETRO. DAY.                                     93

      The Fiat drives through the village and exits down a country
      road.


93A   INT. FIAT - ON LAURA                                      93A

      She glances at the note in her hand.


93B   INT. FIAT - OVER GIUSEPPE                                 93B

                          GIUSEPPE
                Where to now?

                          LAURA
                Keep going...

                          GIUSEPPE
                As the Signora wishes...
                                                     51A.


Instinctively he speeds up past a driveway.

                      LAURA
           Stop.

He does.

                      LAURA (CONT'D)
           Go back.

GIUSEPPE begins to sweat. He reverses the car.

                     LAURA (CONT'D)
           Turn right.

Giuseppe turns up the poplar-lined Lardi driveway.
                                                                52.


94   EXT. THE YARD. MARANELLO. DAY.                               94

                         FERRARI
               This is my old friend Taruffi, last
               time he was second, this time he
               will be first.

     He puts his arm round TARUFFI for the cameras.

     FERRARI now arm in arm with PETER COLLINS.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               Peter Collins... Future World
               Champion.

     FERRARI with his arm round VON TRIPS.

                         FERRARI (CONT'D)
               Taffy Von Trips -- a tiger.


95   EXT. LARDI FARM. DRIVEWAY. DAY.                              95

     The Fiat drives uphill between the rows of poplar trees. It
     feels boldly invasive.

                         LAURA
               Stop.

     She gets out.

     What has attracted LAURA's attention is a green boys bike.


97   LAURA'S FLASHBACK. EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD. DAY. (*OPTIONAL*)     97

     On a yellow bike, twelve year old DINO freewheels down the
     road, his legs splayed wide off the pedals -- thrilled,
     shouting.

     A younger FERRARI in equally high spirits, follows.

     Then, the bike starts to tip, but FERRARI swoops Dino off the
     bike, rescuing him. DINO laughs. LAURA smiles. Charismatic.
     She takes FERRARI's arm. The three of them...


96   EXT. THE YARD. MARANELLO. DAY.                               96

     Meanwhile, FERRARI has his arm round GENDEBIEN.
                                      52A.


          FERRARI
This is Olivier Gendebien, the
fastest driver of road cars in the
World. He will be driving ________.
                                                                53.


      HEADS TURN towards the open gate. LINDA CHRISTIAN gets out of
      an arriving taxi.

                          VOICES
                Hey Linda! Signorina!

      The attention of the PRESS deserts the Master and focuses on
      her.

      LINDA CHRISTIAN in dark glasses and matador pants smiles at
      the PRESS but does not allow them to waylay her as she
      enters.

      FERRARI eyes DE PORTAGO with that blank impassive stab.

      DE PORTAGO shrugs as if to say -- it's nothing to do with me.

                          PHOTOGRAPHER
                Linda, a shot of you by the car.

                          VOICES
                With your boyfriend. And Mr.
                Ferrari.


98    EXT. THE FARM. CASTELVETRO.                                 98

      LAURA stands alone in the driveway. She stares at the green
      bike and the F500-F2 model racecar, rusty from use.

      Her eyes rake over the white house: well-tended; no sign of a
      car.


98A   EXT. THE FARM. DRIVEWAY. CASTELVETRO                       98A

      Back at the gate, Laura gets out of her car, crosses to the
      post box. She opens it, pulls out two letters. They are
      addressed to a Signora Lardi.
                                                               54.


      Laura puts the envelopes back. We see she's taken the rusty
      toy car.


99    EXT. THE YARD. MARANELLO. DAY                                99

      FERRARI, LINDA CHRISTIAN and DE PORTAGO have been backed
      against the 335. FERRARI in the middle. PHOTOGRAPHERS are
      angling for shots--

                          PRESS VOICE 1
                Hey Linda, this way; Linda, over
                here.

                          PRESS VOICE 2
                Mr. Ferrari can we have a smile?

      FERRARI sees among them the sports journalist, RANCATI -- he
      of the plastic features and the mime artist's face.

                          FERRARI
                Rancati. A word, after--

      DE PORTAGO'S arm goes round FERRARI. FERRARI'S arm goes round
      LINDA'S bum. A flash of surprise lights her face but is
      quickly suppressed for the cameras.

      FERRARI firmly draws her hips towards him, revealing the
      yellow shield with the black horse on the side of the car.

      Keeping her body clear of the emblem, he beams for the
      cameras.

101   EXT. THE YARD. MARANELLO. DAY.                              101

      RANCATI and FERRARI stand together. RANCATI ready to
      interview Ferrari for The Automotive Magazine.

                          FERRARI
                Rancati, there's something I want
                you to do for me.

                          RANCATI
                Commendatore, may I be frank with
                you --
                                                 55.


                      FERRARI
          Yes Gino.

                    RANCATI
          My article that you agreed to do
          two months ago "The idea of
          Ferrari." Every time I see you, you
          put me off with --

                     RANCATI (CONT'D)
          "Before I answer that question,
          Rancati, there's something I want
          you to do for me."
              (he becomes agitated)
          When do we begin, Commendatore?

FERRARI eyes him speculatively.

                     FERRARI
          Before I answer that question,
          there's something I want you to do
          for me.
              (beat)
          Write an article suggesting that
          there have been rumors that I am
          talking to Henry Ford II about the
          future of the factory.

RANCATI absorbs the weight of this revelation.

                     FERRARI (CONT'D)
          At the end say you asked me
          bluntly, and that I categorically
          denied it.

                    RANCATI
          And are you categorically denying
          it?
                                                               56.


                          FERRARI
                Of course. Categorically, I deny
                it.

      RANCATI tries to figure out the ramifications of this.


                          RANCATI
                If I write this article, will you
                give me an exclusive on your
                private life?

                          FERRARI
                If you promise not to publish it--

                          RANCATI
                For the time being--

                          FERRARI
                Until I authorize it--

                          RANCATI
                O.K. It's a deal.

      FERRARI gets to his feet.

                                                               57.




103    INT. KITCHEN. THE FARM. CASTELVETRO. DAY                 103

       FERRARI - coming from Rancati - enters the kitchen with an
       ease to him we never see anywhere else (he may pour a glass
       of wine and...) he leans against the wall by the window
       watching the day end over the fields as Lina is making
       Piero's dinner.

       PIERO is in the kitchen absorbed in the racing section of a
       newspaper while...

                            FERRARI
                     (to Lina)
                 You're going tonight?

       (We don't know to where he's referring.)

       LINA is in a cotton robe over a bra and stockings. There's
       still a chill --

       While she serves Piero...

                           LINA
                 Yes. With my friends. The ones you
                 don't like.

       She goes upstairs to finish dressing.


103A   INT. BEDROOM. THE FARM. CASTELVETRO - DAY               103A

       ON LINA. FERRARI enters.

                           FERRARI
                 He's quiet. I didn't get him de
                 Portago's autograph.

                           LINA
                 It's not about that.

                           FERRARI
                 What is it?

                           LINA
                 In two weeks he'll be confirmed. As
                 whom...? Piero Lardi?

       LINA looks at FERRARI.
                                      57A.


          LINA (CONT'D)
We said, when he was ten, we would
sort this out. Then Dino got ill...
he's still Piero Lardi. I'm out of
excuses.

          FERRARI
Postpone the confirmation.

          LINA
His whole class is being confirmed.

          FERRARI
Say he lost faith in God.
                                            58.


                     LINA
          Enzo.
              (beat)
          Who else knows about him?

                    FERRARI
          Nobody. Apart from the Chief of
          Police.

                    LINA
          The doctor?

                    FERRARI
          Well, yes, the doctor.

                    LINA
          And Piero's teachers?

                    FERRARI
          The teachers.

                    LINA
          And Tavoni? Sergio?

                    FERRARI
          Of course, Tavoni.

                    LINA
          And the bank manager?

                    FERRARI
          Yes, the bank manager.

                    LINA
          Enzo --

                     FERRARI
              (vehemently)
          Apart from them. No one.

                     LINA
          Enzo, this is Italy, yes?
              (meaning)
          All of Modena knows.

                     FERRARI
          Except Laura.
              (pause)
          And that must stay as it is.
          Especially for now.

She looks askance at him.
                                                                 59.


                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                What? You're going to tell me,
                "Enzo, don't be so conventionally
                Italian, so bourgeois..."

                          LINA
                Don't make me sound like a beatnik.

                          FERRARI
                You read French books.

                          LINA
                What happened with us in the
                war...happened. As with many.
                Sometimes I wish it didn't.

                          FERRARI
                How can you say that?

                          LINA
                Because if I was a woman like I am
                now, not 12 years ago, I would not
                have interfered in another woman's
                marriage... Yes?

      She's adamant. He's aware, again, of why he's with Lina.

                           LINA (CONT'D)
                And now she's lost a child. But,
                the present is what the present is.
                    (beat)
                And, in our world, right here...
                between me. And you. And Piero?
                What is best for Piero? Who speaks
                for him?

      FERRARI torn, in a dilemma.

                          LINA (CONT'D)
                You're his father.

                          FERRARI
                How do I reconcile this?

                          LINA
                I don't know, but that makes it no
                less important.


104   INT. OPERA HOUSE. EVENING.                                  104

      The orchestra is warming up. People are beginning to take
      their seats.
                                                                 60.


105   INT. FERRARI'S APARTMENT. L.G. EVENING.                     105

      FERRARI ties his tie. The sound of the orchestra tuning can
      be heard. Contemplating LINA's last words. We CUT AWAY before
      he finishes.


106   OMITTED                                                     106


107   INT. LAURA'S APARTMENT. LARGO GARIBALDI HOUSE. EVENING.     107

      FERRARI enters, fully dressed.

      LAURA is watching television. He is surprised to see she
      hasn't changed.

                          FERRARI
                Aren't you coming?

      She shakes her head.

                          LAURA
                Make an excuse for me.

      FERRARI stares at her.

                          FERRARI
                The cash for Cecillia?

                             LAURA
                In my bag.

      FERRARI crosses to her bag, picks out the package of money --
      and does NOT SEE the rusted yellow toy car. We know where it
      came from. He pockets the cash; looks at her and leaves.


108   EXT. THE OPERA HOUSE. SIDE ENTRANCE. NIGHT.                 108

      MIKE HAWTHORN, PETER COLLINS and his wife LOUISE, and other
      STARS OF THE SCUDERIA are making their way inside.

      DE PORTAGO and LINDA CHRISTIAN arrive. PHOTOGRAPHERS descend
      on her. There are a few AUTOGRAPH HUNTERS and FANS in
      attendance, all adding to the confusion at the side entrance.
                                                              61.


109   I/E. FRONT ENTRANCE. OPERA HOUSE. MODENA. NIGHT.         109

      The whole of Modena seems to be trying to get into the
      theatre. BUSINESSMEN, FARMERS, BANKERS and some of the
      FERRARI MECHANICS. TAVONI with his WIFE. CHITI and his wife.

      Off screen the orchestra is still tuning.

      SEE LINA is not part of the racing group. She moves up the
      stairs with her friends, a contemporary, younger crowd come
      up through the center of the stairs and crowd. It's a party
      of LINA plus THREE WOMEN FRIENDS and ONE MAN.

                          LINA
                Where are you guys?

                          LULU
                In the orchestra stalls.


110   INT. GRAND CIRCLE. OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.                   110

      In the Grand Circle, FERRARI makes his way towards the centre
      row of seats near the front.

      Tuning stops.

      LINA enters a box on FERRARI's right. She watches him as he
      sits, noticing that Laura's seat is empty beside him.

      FERRARI makes conversation with those he knows around him --
      one man from the Barber's Shop.

      Large, sleek, confident Adolfo ORSI and his son make their
      way into their row. As they work their way behind FERRARI he
      turns to chide them.

                          FERRARI
                What's this about you're out
                looking for financing? Fangio is
                eating up all your money?

                          ADOLFO ORSI
                You're angry because I won him from
                you?

                          FERRARI
                I let you have him. He costs the
                same as two years overhead.

                          ADOLFO ORSI
                It's not Fangio. The game's
                changing Enzo because of
                television.
                          (MORE)
                                                             61A.

                          ADOLFO ORSI (CONT'D)
                With television it's going to
                become big business. To do this one
                has to be capitalised.

                          FERRARI
                And this outside capital will
                beneficiently bestow itself on you?

                          OMER ORSI
                Of course... After we win the Mille
                Miglia.

      They continue to challenge each other as they find their
      seats.


111   INT. ADALGISA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                          111

      ADALGISA opens the shutters and lets the distant music flood
      in. She sits down on a chair next to her window and listens.

      The TENOR, BRUSONI, launches delicately into 'Parigi O Cara'.
                                                               62.


112   INT. THE OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.                              112

      The audience is quiet. Brusoni sweats profusely. It's not
      just the heat: he is singing for his life. Careers have been
      known to deconstruct here in Modena.

      FERRARI listens to the words -- which he has heard a thousand
      times, but which never fail to move him.


113   INT. LAURA'S ROOM. LARGO GARIBALDI HOUSE. NIGHT.          113

      LAURA sits in a big chair close to the open casement facing
      left. The sound of the tenor floats through the night air.


114   FLASHBACK. INT. THE APARTMENT OVER THE GARAGE. 1930'S.    114

      FERRARI comes out of a bathroom, steaming from a shower, with
      wet hair in a robe, singing the same aria. He is younger,
      more animated.

      Seizing LAURA's dress he clowns around the room, as if
      dancing and singing to it.

      She lies in the bed in a night gown with her arm round little
      DINO -- helpless with laughter.


115   INT. ADALGISA'S APARTMENT. LARGO. GARIBALDI HOUSE. NIGHT. 115

      ADALGISA listens as if in a trance, but to another singer,
      another production, yet further back in time, his picture on
      her dresser next to Alfredo, her dead husband and Alfredo her
      dead son in uniform.

      NOTE: get generic PHOTO of opera singer from about 1890 in
      costume singing his heart out.


116   FLASHBACK. INT. MODENA RAILWAY STATION. 1917. (OPTIONAL - 116
      TIME PERMITTING)

      On a platform, crowds rushing by, ALFREDO dressed for war.
      Confident, shining, but also prescient, as if already on his
      way to heaven, he looks back and addresses his mother, a
      silhouette in the cloud of steam.

      The train begins to move.

      ALFREDO in the crowd of soldiers loading into the train car
      turns and waves and is lost in the crowd.
                                                             62A.


                          ADELGESA (V.O.)
                The wrong son died.


117   FLASHBACK. EXT. AUTODROME. DAY.                          117

      Castellotti's car breaks up on impact.


118   FLASHBACK. INT. THE FARM. CASTELVETRO. DAY.              118

      LINA holds FERRARI tight from the evening after Castellotti
      crashed.
                                                                63.


120    INT. GRAND CIRCLE. OPERA HOUSE. MODENA. NIGHT.              120

       LINA watches FERRARI. She sits in profile, spellbound.


119    INT. THE OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.                                119

       Tears fill FERRARI's eyes...


A121   INT. THE OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.                             A121

       BRUSONI sings his heart out to the woman in bed against the
       dying sunset.


121    FLASHBACK. INT. ASSEMBLY SHOP. THE MARANELLO FACTORY.       121
       1945. DAY.

       FERRARI and TWO WORKERS set aright a turned over lathe... He
       is in the wreck of the Maranello factory: shelled by Germans,
       bombed by the Americans, unroofed.

       The same aria plays.

       LINA approaches. She is young in a light floral shirt and
       cardigan, but shows the same independence and compassion,
       qualities which still attract Ferrari.

                            LINA
                     (proudly)
                 I'm pregnant.

       FERRARI breaks into a smile.


122    INT. THE OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.                                122

       The duet comes to an end on BRUSONI'S last notes. They hang
       suspended in the silent House.

       The AUDIENCE sits in a state of reverie.

       At a loss, BRUSONI, dripping sweat, looks up at the gallery
       which now explodes with applause.

       A barrage of approval.

123    EXT. RACE TRACK. ROUEN-LES-ESSARTS. DAY.                    123

       The angry front of DE PORTAGO'S 801 charges at us.
                                                       63A.


From DE PORTAGO'S POV: buffeted by the slipstream and
juddering over the uneven surface, DE PORTAGO hangs onto
BEHRA's 250F single-seater screaming out of a bend. Then
rockets even with BEHRA into the straight.
                                                              64.

129   INT. SCAGLIETTI BARN (VIA EMILIA) - DAY                  129

      SERGIO SCAGLIETTI -- wiry, tough with a gravely voice lounges
      in casual clothes. In the bucolic stone barn - which could
      have been a tractor shed - from the beams hang the wooden
      bucks and frames for the most beautiful car bodies ever made
      in Italy.

      Ferrari pours Lambrusco into two tumblers while Scaglietti
      tends a chicken on a spit over a coal fire in a cut down oil
      drum.

                          FERRARI
                Where is everybody?

                          SCAGLIETTI
                I gave them the day off.

                          FERRARI
                No wonder you're so late with
                everything, Sergio.

                          SCAGLIETTI
                Enzo. It's Sunday. My men work
                weekends all through the year for
                you. Their children haven't seen
                them since the day they were born.

                          FERRARI
                Well, here's to you and that pack
                of colorblind louts you employ.

      He turns and toasts them.
                                                                64A.


      On a 1957 TV a fuzzy live broadcast of the French Grand Prix
      plays. On the screen the camera position is at the finish         *

      Fangio leads followed by Hawthorne in a Ferrari and then Jean     *
      Behra in a Maserati and newcomer Fon De Portago in a Ferrari.     *
      Moss trails them in a Vanwall. He points out Collins has          *
      pitted, withdrawn. Then it cuts to the score board.               *

      Then it cuts to COLLINS in the pit lane. Ferrari focuses on       *
      the banners behind the racers: SHELL, ENGLEBERT, PIRELLI.
      Then, the commercial potential.                                   *

      COLLINS' gear box is gone -- he shrugs philosophically.           *

       DE PORTAGO -- through black smoke -- picks up a great spray     *
       of oil on his goggles, which after trying to clear he pulls
       off.

       The goggles fly away and are flattened by the following car.

       DE PORTAGO pulls on his second pair which have been around
       his neck.

       He slingshots out of the slip stream and pulls even with
       BEHRA as they rocket downhill into and through the straight,    *
       heading towards--

       DE PORTAGO'S 801 and BEHRA's Maserati 250F are side by side
       with Behra more on the correct line for the left-hander
       racing at them. They're both racing for the same apex of the
       turn.

       Two objects can't occupy the same point in space at the same
       moment in time. The Maserati 250F is inches ahead. They'll
       crash. DE PORTAGO brakes, falls in behind. Behra through the
       turn.

      DE PORTAGO, still slipstreaming BEHRA; makes out a board.
      Then a second board, calling him in.

      Cursing he brakes, flicks the wheel.


135   EXT. PITS. FROM DE PORTAGO'S POV.                           135

      The pit lane is a blur but suddenly he is at a stop behind
      Collin's stationary car, which is swarming with MECHANICS.
      COLLINS and TAVONI walk towards him.

                          TAVONI
                Out, Fon. Peter's taking over.

      DE PORTAGO can't believe it.

      He pulls himself from the cockpit.

                          COLLINS
                Thanks old man.

      He swivels himself in. Behind him they're re-fueling. Ahead,
      they're wheeling away Collins' car.

      DE PORTAGO pulls off his gloves, pissed. COLLINS accelerates
      off. DE PORTAGO, adrenalin still pumping through his body,
      walks away trying to control his rage.

      COLLINS in DE PORTAGO'S car is immediately sideswiped and         *
      rips off the track into a stand of young trees, narrowly          *
      missing the trunks, till --

      -- Until he comes to a halt, the front wheels torn off.           *

      Slowly, he pulls himself out of the cockpit and staggers to
      the nearest tree where he props himself up. He pulls off his
      gloves, pushes up his goggles and looks at the wreck.

      In the distance people are running through the trees towards
      him.

                          COLLINS
                Bloody hell!


138   EXT. PITS/TRACK. ROUEN-LES-ESSARTS. DAY.                    138

      OFF SCREEN a band plays the French National Anthem.

      In the paddock: DE PORTAGO watches as nearby, COLLINS gets
      painfully into a Marshall's saloon, his neck in a temporary
      brace.

      DE PORTAGO, his emotions veering between rage and concern for
      COLLINS' injury, approaches.

                          DE PORTAGO
                Are you O.K.?

                           COLLINS
                Right as rain, mate. A bit shook
                up.
                    (beat)
                Sorry about your car, old boy. It's
                a bit of a mess.

      DE PORTAGO nods again and crosses to where the twisted
      remains of the car is being manually heaved onto the factory
      low-loader.

      DE PORTAGO is still flushed with adrenalin.

                          DE PORTAGO
                I could have taken him.

      TAVONI shrugs.

                           DE PORTAGO (CONT'D)
                Behra...

139   INT. DINING ROOM. CAVALINO. DAY.                         139

                          FERRARI
                You lack commitment.

      The Spring Team, HAWTHORN, COLLINS, DE PORTAGO, GENDEBIEN and
      VON TRIPS are sitting around the remains of lunch. Smoking,
      but listening to FERRARI intently --

                           FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Look at the Maserati team. Fangio,
                Behra, Stirling Moss, hard nosed
                pros. Men with a brutal
                determination to win. A cruel
                emptiness in their stomachs.
                Detached men. Loyal to one thing.
                Not the team. Loyal to their lust
                to win.
                    (beat)
                It rains. The track is slippery
                with oil, an evil handling car,
                will they falter? No.
                    (pause)
                My Spring Team. Courageous?
                Skillful? Yes. Youthful, recently
                in school--
                    (looks at Von Trips and de
                      Portago)
                Aristocrats straight from Almanac
                de Gotha. Gentlemen sportsmen. Very
                nice.
                    (stops; leans in)
                On the straight into the tight
                corner at Nouveau Monde? There's
                only one line through it. Behra
                pulls up next to you, challenging.
                You're even. But two objects cannot
                occupy the same point in space at
                the same moment in time. Behra
                doesn't lift. The corner races at
                you. You have, perhaps, a crisis of
                identity. Am I a sportsman or a
                competitor? How will the French
                think of me if I run Behra into a
                tree? You lift. He passes. He won.
                You lost.
                    (he looks at them; then)
                At that same moment Behra thought:
                fuck it, we both die.
                    (pause)
                Make no mistake.
                           (MORE)
                                                      69.

                All of us are racers. Or we have
                been. We all are certain it will
                never happen to me.
                    (beat)
                Then our friend is killed. We give
                up racing forever on Monday. Then,
                we are back racing by Sunday.
                    (beat)
                We all know it is a terrible joy. A
                deadly passion.
                    (beat)
                And, if you get into one of my race
                cars -- and no one is forcing you
                to take that seat -- you get in to
                win. Brake later. Steal their line.
                Deny them space. Make them make the
                mistake.


140   INT. THE CAVALINO. DAY.                          140

      FERRARI and DE PORTAGO exit.

                          DE PORTAGO
                I would have taken him.

      FERRARI gives him a look.

                          FERRARI
                I'm changing the line-up for the
                Mille Miglia. I want you and
                Olivier to swap cars. He'll drive
                the little coupe and you'll get the
                335... can you handle it?

      DE PORTAGO is knocked out by this offer.

                          DE PORTAGO
                You're giving me the most powerful
                car in the race?

      FERRARI nods.

                          FERRARI
                Put it another way, I'm giving
                Gendebien the agile coupe.

                          DE PORTAGO
                Won't he mind?

                          FERRARI
                Of course he will. But he'll beat
                you anyway.

He passes the document across to LAURA -- six copies of it.

                    COSETTI (CONT'D)
          And the check for five hundred
          thousand dollars--

LAURA picks up the check, scrutinizes it, returns it to him.

                    LAURA
          It has not been signed.

COSETTI looks up, shrugs --

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          The signing of these affidavits was
          conditional on the exchange of the
          check.

                    COSETTI
          I'm sure it was an oversight.

LAURA smiles.

                    LAURA
          Bullshit, Cosetti.

She picks the check up and puts it in her bag, nevertheless.
She studies the affidavits. Coffee is brought in on a tray.
She refuses the cream and sweeteners.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          You have a pen?

She signs the Power of Attorney -- six times -- whilst
COSETTI looks on. His silence makes her realize how important
this transaction is, and how worried they had been that she
might not cooperate. Signing off, COSETTI looks relieved.

                       COSETTI
          Excellent.

He holds out his hand to take the papers.

                    LAURA
          I'll hold onto these, too, until I
          get my check signed--

His hand is left hanging in the air.

                    COSETTI
          Then I guess that will be all.
                                                                  72.


                           LAURA
                 Not quite. I want information about
                 special payments, made by the
                 factory last year--

       COSETTI can see it coming.

                            COSETTI
                 To whom?

                           LAURA
                 Lina Lardi.

       COSETTI stares at her, struck dumb.

                           LAURA (CONT'D)
                 I want to know how much they are,
                 and for how long they have been
                 going on.

       LAURA is in a call box in the town center near the bank.
       GIUSEPPE waits in the background in Laura's car.

                           LAURA (V.O.)
                 Enzo? Lina Lardi! Does that name
                 mean anything to you?

                            LAURA
                  I need to think about this, Enzo.

       She doesn't hang up.

165    EXT. SCAGLIETTI WORKS. DAY.                              165

       SERGIO SCAGLIETTI in overalls is at a rusting cafe table. He
       is pouring himself a glass of white Trebbiano when Ferrari's
       car pulls onto the cracked forecourt. SCAGLIETTI directs the
       bottle into a second tumbler.

       FERRARI, hitching up his pants, trudges towards Scaglietti,
       takes the tumbler and they drift towards the barn.
                                                              74.


167   EXT. BARN. DAY.                                             167

      SCAGLIETTI unlocks the padlock, opens the door, revealing the
      prototype of the 250 "pontoon fender," red Testa Rossa. Other
      cars in varying states of finish pale next to its ferocious
      beauty. It's like a red, low-slung snake about to strike.
      Even FERRARI, who has seen everything, is stunned.


166   INT. THE BARN. SCAGLIETTI WORKS. DAY.                       166

      FERRARI wanders around the new Testa Rossa. He lays his hand
      on the great throat of the fuel filler and finishes his wine.

      SCAGLIETTI, who has followed with the bottle, refills the
      glass.

                          FERRARI
                She found out.

                             SCAGLIETTI
                The boy?

                             FERRARI
                That, too.

      SCAGLIETTI kicks the rubber on the Testa Rossa.

                          SCAGLIETTI
                So what do you think?

      Up on the wall, above the drawing table, two pigeons in a
      cage coo softly.
                                                        75.


                    FERRARI
          The driver in front of it will piss
          his pants when he sees it in his
          mirror --

SCAGLIETTI nods.

                     FERRARI (CONT'D)
          And when it passes, it has an ass
          on it like a Canova sculpture.
              (beat)
          So, what do I do?

He refers to the business with Laura.

                    SCAGLIETTI
          What do you want to do?

                    FERRARI
          I want to leave her.

                    SCAGLIETTI
          So. Do it...

FERRARI in a state of perfect dilemma shows in his
face...Yes. No.

SCAGLIETTI points to the cage hanging from one of the beams.

                    SCAGLIETTI (CONT'D)
          You see that pigeon up there?

FERRARI nods.

                    SCAGLIETTI (CONT'D)
          I left its door open, but it won't
          come out. It's forgotten what
          freedom is--

                    FERRARI
          Freedom for that pigeon is pigeon
          pie.

                    SCAGLIETTI
          Tell Laura that you two should live
          apart, you're going to live with
          Lina and that you're going to
          recognize the boy. Everybody thinks
          that you should anyway.

                    FERRARI
          I don't give a damn what everybody
          thinks. What do you think?
                                                              76.


                           SCAGLIETTI
                    (less facetious)
                There are a lot of people on your
                payroll with families. The factory
                needs continuity for Ferrari to
                stay Ferrari. (but do you really
                care what anybody thinks?)

      FERRARI takes this in silence.

      He finishes his wine. He looks up at the pigeon before he
      leaves.

                           FERRARI
                We have history.
                    (to cage)
                Stay there pigeon, or you're dead
                meat.

      The door opens. FERRARI enters, shuts it and, girding himself
      for the confrontation, makes his way across the hall to the
      stairs.


170   INT. LAURA'S ROOM. FERRARI'S HOUSE. L.G. NIGHT.             170

      FERRARI opens the door. LAURA is waiting for him, sitting at
      the table. She has been going through the accounts.

      FERRARI enters. She looks up coldly. He goes to the
      sideboard, pours a glass of wine.

                          LAURA
                The whole of Emilia knows, but not
                me?

                          FERRARI
                I thought it would break your
                heart.

                          LAURA
                You broke my heart years ago,
                Enzo...
                                                        77.


FERRARI doesn't reply. And he doesn't believe it, either. It
was Dino who had broken her heart.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          When did it start? According to
          Cosetti the payments began in the
          1940's.

FERRARI nods.

                    FERRARI
          The war. The factory had been
          bombed twice. It began during the
          worst of it. She worked at
          Carrozzeria Orlandi. You and Dino
          were in the hills that year. By
          Christmas she was pregnant. So I
          bought Castelvetro and she went to
          live there.

LAURA broods on this. We now notice that on her writing table
there are at least three photographs of Dino including the
photograph of Dino on the yellow bike.

                    LAURA
          Is it that she's different from the
          others?

                    FERRARI
          I was in love with her--

Then he adds --

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          And I still am.

Suddenly, from a position of righteousness, LAURA feels her
feet cut from under her.

Devastated. A whole new landscape of the past now presents
itself, in which all those nights when she thought he was off
whoring, he was actually with another 'wife'.

                    LAURA
          I find myself sharing my whole life
          with a woman I have never met.

LAURA starts to prowl the room.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          It makes a mockery of you in those
          years when Dino was ill and
          dying...
                                                78.


                    FERRARI
          How can you say that?

                    LAURA
          That boy?   Is he going to inherit
          our factory? Our name?

He doesn't answer.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          We have a son. I don't want him to.

FERRARI stares at her.

                     FERRARI
          One son, two sons, five sons. I
          miss Dino any less?
              (beat)
          Every morning I see him in the
          cemetery. The hospital he died in
          is funded in his name. A school was
          built in his honor...

                    LAURA
          "Honor." Who gives a shit? You were
          supposed to save him.

                    FERRARI
          You blame me for his death!?

                    LAURA
          You promised me he wouldn't die.

                    FERRARI
          Everything! I did everything.
          Tables, showing the calories he
          could eat, what went in, what came
          out. I graphed the degrees of
          albuminuria, the degrees of
          azotemia, diuresis -- I know more
          about nephritis and dystrophy than
          cars.

                    LAURA
          Yes! Yes, I blame you! You told me
          you wouldn't let him die. You
          promised!

                    FERRARI
          ...the father, he deluded himself!
          The great engineer. I will restore
          my son to health. Swiss doctors,
          Italian doctors. Bullshit. I could
          not. I did not.
                                                        79.


                    LAURA
          Cause you were so "consoled" at
          Castelvetro, you lost your
          attention. You had another boy
          getting stronger while Dino got
          weaker.

FERRARI is frozen by the accusation.

                    FERRARI
          What goes on in your head? He got
          sick! Dystrophy, kidneys. It
          destroyed him. It destroyed you.
          Destroyed us.

                    LAURA
          What do you care? Why do you care?
          You have another wife. Another son.

                     FERRARI
          She is not my wife.
              (pause)
          But, he is my son--

LAURA goes eerily, completely calm --

                    LAURA
          Move out. The best thing for you to
          do is move.

FERRARI is suddenly exhausted.

                    FERRARI
          If you want, I'll move upstairs. To
          the outside eye, nothing will
          change.

                    LAURA
          No, everything will have changed--

                    FERRARI
          This is our history, our life. We
          are partners.

She looks at him bitterly.

She pauses, then produces the papers, relating to the power
of attorney.

                    LAURA
          These are the papers, they give you
          power to negotiate on my behalf.
                                                       79A.


Tears stream down her face, but she gives in to them not one
iota! She produces the check.
                                                                80.


                          LAURA (CONT'D)
                There is a problem with your check;
                you forgot to put your name to it.

      In silence, FERRARI hauls out his big Waterman pen with its
      violet ink. He looks at her --

                          FERRARI
                This is a gun pointed at my head.
                You cash it before I conclude a
                deal, Ferrari is no more.

      FERRARI signs. Hands it to her.

                          LAURA
                That's right.

      She scrutinizes the check, folds it away, and hands over the
      power of attorney documents.

      PIERO hears a car approach. He comes to the edge of the
      stairs and looks down. He sees FERRARI enter and

      LINA and FERRARI embrace -- FERRARI is trembling. He sets
      down the case he brought.

      She senses his distress and hugs him.

                          LINA
                What is it?

      As they walk towards the kitchen--

                             FERRARI
                It's done.

      The door closes leaving PIERO on the stairs puzzled.

      She turns off the radio.
                                                                 81.


173   INT. KITCHEN. CHERRY FARM. CASTELVETRO. NIGHT.              173

      She sits at the table, her head in her hands. They've been
      talking for a while.

      Silence.... Eventually...

                          FERRARI
                You'll come to Modena.

      She looks up surprised.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Why not? Modena is where I live.
                Where we'll live.

                          LINA
                That's her town.

                          FERRARI
                It's our town.

                           LINA
                It's not me.
                    (beat)
                Piero. What does he do? Sneak
                around?
                    (beat)
                And as whom?
                    (pause)
                She knows he's our boy?

                           FERRARI
                She knows he's my son.
                    (pause)
                But nothing has been resolved.

      She faces FERRARI. He takes her hand. The dilemma is from
      different perspectives but mutually shared.

175   INT. LINA'S BEDROOM. CASTELVETRO. DAWN.                     175

      LINA's eye opens. She hears the door latch shut with its
      familiar double click, her eyes open wider.

                          LINA

176   EXT. FARMHOUSE. CASTELVETRO. DAWN.                       176

      In the dawn air, FERRARI puts on his boots and is about to
      open the door of his Peugeot when --

      There is the sound of a casement window above him.

                             PIERO (V.O.)
                Hey, Papa!

      He looks up.

      PIERO's head is framed at the window.

                          PIERO
                De Portago's autograph!

                          FERRARI
                You go back to sleep!

                             PIERO
                Papa!

      FERRARI looks up again.

                           PIERO (CONT'D)
                    (chanting)
                Ferra - ri!

      FERRARI chuckles, waves.


177   EXT. STARTING RAMP - DAY                                 177

      CHORUS Ferra-ri! Ferra-ri!

      The Piazza is packed on Saturday afternoon for the technical
      inspection. A brass band, announcements on loudspeakers, the
      flashing of photographers bulbs and the revving of a hundred
      roadcars, herald the beginning of the Mille Miglia. The sound
      of the Ferra-ri chorus dominates the square.

      FERRARI makes his way through the chaotic crowd and cars.
      This is the first time we have seen him mobbed this way. A
      demi-god to his supporters, he nods at those he knows,
      salutes others, shakes hands--

      FERRARI enters, ADOLFO and OMER ORSI are at a table, signing
      in, as are a number of other owner and factory team managers.
      They collect the cards (libreto di marcia) that each driver
      must show at every checkpoint.

      A cream-colored TV camera like a small refrigerator is on a
      heavy tripod focused on a TV COMMENTATOR narrating the event.
                                                      82A.


                           FERRARI
                Good evening, gentlemen.
                Everything's going like clockwork I
                see.
                    (to the Orsis)
                Good evening, Orsi.

                Signor Ferrari?

                           FERRARI

182    EXT. MARZOTTO HOTEL. MANERBIO. THAT NIGHT.                  182

       FERRARI parks the Peugeot in the forecourt near the front
       door and gets out.

       Five Mille Miglia cars are sitting on the lawn, the mechanics
       still busily working on them -- but quietly, knowing that the
       drivers are asleep.

       FERRARI glides through, nearly unseen and enters the hotel.


183    INT. HALL/BAR. THE MARZOTTO. MANERBIO. NIGHT.               183

       FERRARI is greeted by the owner, an old friend. He has been
       coming each year since the war.

                            OWNER
                  Good evening, Commendatore.

                            FERRARI
                  And to you, my friend.

       The OWNER nods him towards the bar. FERRARI doesn't break
       stride.

       CHITI and the CHIEF MECHANIC sit at a nearby table -- eating
       a sandwich -- and talking in a low voice to TAVONI. Between
       them sits what looks like a pair of Weber carburetors.

       FERRARI joins them at the bar. Above them is a black and
       white TV. Two Patrons and the Bartender are glued to it.
                                                                 84.


                          TV COMMENTATOR
                ...and so the 24th Mille Miglia,
                the World's longest and most
                treacherous road race starts with
                the dispatch of the smallest of the
                racing cars...

                 FERRARI                      TV COMMENTATOR (CONT'D)
      Make sure they show these at    The factory cars, some of the
      every control otherwise         most powerful in the world,
      they're disqualified.           will start last - about 5
                                      o'clock in the morning.

      FERRARI hands TAVONI the five official entry cards.

      ADOLFO ORSI is being interviewed --

                          ADOLFO ORSI
                For Maserati, this is an important
                race for us. Winning the Mille
                Miglia would confirm our position
                as the World's Number One
                constructor of...

      FERRARI ignores him, looks at CHITI and pulls his note book
      from his pocket. There are neatly written notes in purple
      ink.

                          FERRARI
                I have a few last minute
                instructions --


184   INT. DE PORTAGO'S BEDROOM. MARZOTTO HOTEL. NIGHT            184

      DE PORTAGO sits at the dressing table. He has an envelope on
      which he writes quickly --

                          DE PORTAGO
                "In case I don't make it --"

      He does not have the slightest doubt that he will, but wives
      and girlfriends have to be written to --

                          DE PORTAGO   (CONT'D)
                I'm writing to Linda--

      Reveal NELSON lies on his bed, smoking a cigarette and
      checking through a number of maps which cover the route.

      DE PORTAGO stares at a blank piece of paper.

                          DE PORTAGO (CONT'D)
                What do I say?
                                                              85.


      NELSON dictates it like a business letter --

                          NELSON
                My darling Linda, in the unlikely
                event that tomorrow is my last day
                on earth, I am writing to you...


185   INT. COLLINS' BEDROOM. MARZOTTO HOTEL.                   185

      LOUISE lies asleep in bed. The book she has been reading
      still in her hand. COLLINS finishes reading a two page letter
      he has written to her. He now signs it "Peter". He folds it
      and standing up -- slips it into the back of her book.


186   INT. TARUFFI'S ROOM. MARZOTTO HOTEL.                     186

      Clad in his underwear and smoking a cigarette. TARUFFI
      carefully, almost ritualistically, places on his shirt for
      tomorrow -- his worn and faded map of Italy, his wristwatch,
      cigarettes, matches, his lucky key ring and a medallion of
      St. Anthony.

      FERRARI, who has been giving notes all night, makes his final
      point.

                          FERRARI
                Refueling. Remind the mechanics,
                the gas is to go into the tanks.
                          (MORE)

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Not on the drivers - particularly
                Taruffi. I'd prefer he not go up in
                flames.

                          CHITI
                Anything else...

                          FERRARI
                No. That's it.

      They all look at him, exhausted.

      COLLINS leaps down the stairs, alert, cheerful.

                          COLLINS
                Morning everybody, are we all set?

190   EXT. STARTING RAMP. NIGHT FOR DAWN.                      190

      The long line of cars -- nose to tail -- starts at the top of
      the ramp and one is flagged and launches.

      The shattering explosion of sound as the V.l2's rev-up and
      echo terrifyingly off stone walls. We're in among the real
      beasts.

      CROWD, MECHANICS, CAMERA CREWS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, flashbulbs
      popping, surround the ramp and the line of cars leading up to
      it.

      We SCAM past the departing car to the next car to depart and
      then past (available ND exotics or) a D-Type Jaguar to
      FERRARI, who shouts to GENDEBIEN in his 250 Coupe, looking up
      at him--

                          FERRARI
                This car knows its way round
                blindfolded, Olivier. Take it easy
                till you reach the coast. Once the
                rain stops -- you can put your foot
                down.
                                                        87.


GENDEBIEN powers his car further along the "up" ramp.

The TIMEKEEPER flashes his lamp. And the Jaguar D-Type in
front of GENDEBIEN screams into the dawn in a blaze of burnt
rubber and blistered air.

                       FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Good luck.

As FERRARI continues to walk down the line, we begin to
realize that these cars, the last and fastest of the entries
are mostly Ferraris: 240mm's, Touring Testa Rossas, 860
Monzas.

A two-year-old Scaglietti Spyder Competition. The DRIVER is
sheltered against the rain by a golf umbrella. FERRARI wishes
him well.

                     TV COMMENTATOR
          The 24th Mille Miglia, the world's
          longest and most treacherous road
          race, started with the dispatch of
          the smallest of the racing cars.
          Painted on each car is the time of
          its departure. It is a race against
          the clock.
              (beat)
          The factory cars, some of the most
          powerful in the world, are starting
          after five this morning.

          And now, I am most privileged to
          have at my side Maserati's esteemed
          owner, Cavaliere Adolfo Orsi.

                    ADOLFO ORSI
          For Maserati, this is a most
          important race. Winning the Mille
          Miglia this year will confirm our
          position as the World's Number One
          race car constructor, especially
          after our win by Manuel Fangio in
          the Argentine Grand Prix.

DE PORTAGO watches FERRARI, still bending over the private
entry Ferrari (Monza?). Beside him, NELSON is scrutinizing a
map with the aid of a torch.

                     NELSON
              (confiding)
          The Italians aren't generous with
          road signs.
                                                        87A.


                    DE PORTAGO
          You know where we're going?

                    NELSON
          No. Follow the taillights of the
          car in front. Once the sun comes up
          I'll see landmarks.

DE PORTAGO engages his clutch and creeps forward till he's
parallel with FERRARI.

                    FERRARI
          Remember what I told you. Get behind
          Taruffi or Collins, They know the
          way. If you can hang onto him till
          you reach Bologna, you're in with a
          chance.

DE PORTAGO nods. FERRARI hesitates, leans in--

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          One last thing. Can you autograph
          this. It's for a very special young
          man.

DE PORTAGO nods.

                    DE PORTAGO
          What's his name?

                      FERRARI
          Piero ...

He takes the book and Ferrari's pen.

                     FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Piero.
              (spells it)
          P.I.E.R.O.

An OFFICIAL comes along with his torch, signaling for DE
PORTAGO to roll forward.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          If Moss or Behra attempt to pass,
          wave them through. Your job is to
          get round in one piece.

With a grin DE PORTAGO returns the book, duly signed.

                    DE PORTAGO
          See you in Bologna--
                                                       87B.


                       FERRARI
          Good luck.

As FERRARI rises, DE PORTAGO's car tailgates the car in front
(ND?) up towards the ramp.

FERRARI leans over VON TRIPS in 532.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Comfortable, Taffy?

VON TRIPS nods.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Keep an eye on Stirling, if he
          passes you, let him go. Catch him
          later. I know it's your first, but
          I know you can win this.

VON TRIPS nods and FERRARI moves into --

-- the headlamps of COLLINS' 335 (534). He waits as it
rumbles up to him -- all 400 horsepower. COLLINS pokes his
head over the door, KLEMANTASKI, his navigator beside him.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Morning, Peter.

                     COLLINS
          It's going to be a good one!
              (he gestures behind him)

                    FERRARI
          This car can win. Once you are over
          the mountains, you've got the legs
          on the others... And then it will
          be either you or de Portago.
          Understand?

COLLINS nods.

                    COLLINS
          You're forgetting Moss and Behra?

                     FERRARI
              (dismisses them)
          Watch out for stray dogs and
          children: they're the real danger.

COLLINS smiles at the joke.
                                                       87C.


FERRARI - lit by the headlights of TARUFFI's car - moves to
where the veteran smokes a cigarette and displays an air of
calm which is only skin deep as he studies his blue race
book.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          You can win this one, Taruffi, if
          you don't smoke yourself to death
          before it's over--

He takes TARUFFI's fag out of his mouth and throws it away.

                    TARUFFI
          What's the weather on the Futa
          Pass?

                    FERRARI
          Good. Maybe rain. Listen to me. You
          need this race. How can you tell
          your grandchildren that you picked
          up every trophy in Europe but you
          never won at Brescia?

TARUFFI lights another cigarette and begins to creep the car
forward.
                                                           88-89.


                          TARUFFI
                Make sure I get the backup. No foul-
                ups, you understand, at the fuel
                stops, especially.

                          FERRARI
                That's the spirit, Piero.

      TARUFFI'S car moves forward.

      FERRARI glances behind him over a privateer to the Maserati
      450s of MOSS and BEHRA rumbling into frame - their drivers
      sheltered by the ORSIS' umbrellas. MOSS's hand goes up in a
      salute which FERRARI returns and then turns away.

      ADOLFO ORSI, turns his back to FERRARI to confer with his two
      drivers, first MOSS...

                           ADOLFO ORSI
                The race plan. Behra stays behind
                the lead Ferrari's. Waits. Some
                will break down, eliminate
                themselves. Then, he'll attack from
                the back some time before Bologna
                when there is an hour or two left.
                    (to Moss)
                You? You take the lead at the start
                and lead from the front.

193   EXT. ON STARTING RAMP. NIGHT FOR DAWN.                      193

      Engines rev higher; the flag goes up --

      [OPT: VON TRIPS (532)] COLLINS (534) and then TARUFFI (535)
      shoot off the ramp, the way jets fly off a carrier, their
      round tail lamps glowing like after-burners.

      Immediately, they are followed by MOSS and BEHRA in their
      Maseratis -- all of them struggling for traction on the wet
      pavement.

      When they are gone, FERRARI is left facing the ORSIS. Neither
      of them speak. A relative silence falls on the wet and
      desolate square. Everything hangs in the balance.

      GIUSEPPE is at the Peugeot. He gets out of the passenger seat
      and swings open the driver's door for Ferrari. FERRARI shakes
      the hand of a COUPLE OF OFFICIALS as he, CHITI and TAVONI
      clamber in.

      The Peugeot accelerates out of the square on the tail of
      others, all making their way south.

      The RACE OFFICIAL swallows a glass of Grappa and indicates
      the departing Modenese.

                          RACE OFFICIAL
                For once he did not complain.

      OFF the static officials --


194   INT. DE PORTAGO'S 335. NIGHT FOR DAWN.                      194

      NOTE: ROAD TO RAVENNA SEQ

      DE PORTAGO, at breakneck speed, follows TARUFFI. He's
      illuminated by the glare of MOSS' headlamps. Behind him the
      big Maserati is on his tail all the way. As he hits the
      straight, the large works cars speed up.
                                                                  91.


194A   EXT. ROAD TO RAVENNA - DAWN                                194A

       The works Ferrari's pass a few smaller fast Lancia's like
       they're standing still on the long road across the flat
       landscape.

       Then they pass privateer and older Ferrari's and a Mercedes
       gullwing.

       Their speed on public roads on this stretch pushes to 240-
       250kph and beyond.


195    EXT. ROAD THROUGH VALLEY. DAWN.                             195

                           MOSS
                 Okay, I'm going to see what she can
                 do.

       MOSS opens up the Maserati.


196    INT. DE PORTAGO'S 335. (TOP UP).                            196

       DE PORTAGO looks left as the Maserati sweeps by. He shifts
       down. Nelson yells --

                           NELSON
                 Let him go, Fon.

       But DE PORTAGO tucks in behind the Maserati, and is towed, as
       the two race cars pass TARUFFI.


197    INT. TARUFFI'S CAR.                                         197

       TARUFFI looks left, sees DE PORTAGO -- mouths "let him go".


198    EXT. LONG LEFT HAND CURVE. DAWN.                            198

       MOSS with DE PORTAGO behind are now on COLLINS' tail.      MOSS
       rockets forward to overtake on the inside.


199    INT. COLLINS 335. (TOP DOWN).                               199

       As the curve begins to tighten, COLLINS sees MOSS in his
       mirror. He shifts left to block MOSS's line.


200    INT. DE PORTAGO'S 335.                                      200

       DE PORTAGO right behind MOSS.
                                                                92.


201   EXT. RIGHT HANDER + MEADOW. DAWN.                          201

      The three cars accelerate around the curve; MOSS, hemmed in,
      but taking advantage of the inside bend, edges ahead.
      (OPTIONAL: TARUFFI catches up.) MOSS dinks to the right.
      COLLINS moves right to block.

      MOSS, instead passes COLLINS to the left, edging ahead. Side
      by side, dicing for the lead. 260, 270kph. MOSS's Maserati's
      nose edging ahead of COLLINS (double) Ferrari.


202   EXT. LONG LEFT HANDER. DAWN.                               202

      COLLINS with DE PORTAGO behind him, are on the outside of the
      bend - i.e. the right side of the road.

      SEE their feet brake; HANDS downshift, as they brake for the
      left hand turn racing at them --

      MOSS suddenly shoots ahead of COLLINS, as if he'll take the
      turn full out without braking.

      It is violent and inexplicable.

      Suddenly, MOSS jerks the Maserati left and DISAPPEARS?!

      DE PORTAGO (or double) quickly reacts.


203   INT. THE MASERATI IN THE MEADOW.                           203

      JENKS holds on, looks at MOSS quizzically--

      The Maserati, shearing its mirrors, et al, plows across a
      meadow, MOSS trying to hold it steady as it flies over uneven
      ground.

                           MOSS
                    (shrugs)
                No brakes.

      MOSS down shifts rapidly to slough off speed.


204   EXT. MEADOW. DAWN                                          204

      It travels this way for a hundred yards -- JENKS half out of
      the cockpit, MOSS coaxing her down through the gears -- till
      it comes to rest in a boiling rage, overhung by its own plume
      of dust.
                                                             92A.


205   EXT. ROAD TO RAVENNA. DAWN.                              205

      The four Ferraris head away on the long straight through the
      trees. TARUFFI passes DE PORTAGO so the order is COLLINS,
      TARUFFI, DE PORTAGO, VON TRIPPS. BEHRA's Maserati right on
      their tail.


206   EXT. MEADOW. DAWN.                                       206

      MOSS's Maserati lies in the middle of a huge meadow. A low
      mist drifts across it giving it an unworldly feeling.
                                                              93.


      In the distance, the sound of cattle bells and the bark of a
      dog. Far away the whine of the Ferraris as they climb the
      hill.

      MOSS leans forward in the cockpit and produces the offending
      article from somewhere around his feet. The brake pedal. It
      had snapped off at the stalk. He hands it to JENKS and turns
      the ignition key. The big engine stumbles into life, MOSS
      turns the wheel --

                          MOSS
                Let's get this bugger home...


207   EXT. SMALL BAR EMILIA. EARLY MORNING.                       207

      A small bar. The OWNER opens his shutters as the Peugeot
      (could be Fiat 1100TV), driven by FERRARI, stops outside.
      FERRARI kills the ignition, gets out, followed by CHITI and
      TAVONI.

      (NOTE: location could be near the Bologna refueling point.)


208   INT. SMALL BAR. EARLY MORNING.                              208

      The radio is already on, with commentary on the race. FERRARI
      makes for the telephone. He dials. The rest follow him in.
      CHITI goes to the bar. Patrons are clustered around the
      console radio --

                           FERRARI
                    (into phone)
                Race Control?

      At the counter CHITI orders espressos. The coffee trickles
      into the warm cups.

                          RADIO BROADCASTER
                The first car into Ravenna this
                morning was a Fiat Cinquecento
                timed at one hundred and forty on
                the final section.

      FERRARI takes a seat at the table. CHITI arrives with the
      coffee.

                          FERRARI
                Moss is out...

210    EXT. APPROACHING RAVENNA. DAY.(OPT.)                        210

       The four Ferraris hurtle along the dead straight road   like a
       red posse. There is something predatory about the way   they
       pack one behind the other, and devour the stragglers,   a
       couple of Alfas. They are headed by COLLINS, TARUFFI,   DE
       PORTAGO and VON TRIPPS.

       They are being tracked by BEHRA's Maserati as they charge
       into --


211-212 OMITTED                                                211-212


213    EXT. RAVENNA. THE PIAZZA. DAY.                              213

       The screams as the Ferraris change down gears, between the
       narrow medieval walls, are frightening. They're racing up on
       a smaller and slower Alfa Romeo ahead of them.

       The Alfa Romeo shoots out of the street into the piazza but
       ends up losing it, understeers and runs straight into the
       straw barrier. Crowds cheer. SPECTATORS crowd the roofs, the
       balconies and windows.

       A Ferrari appears, powers round the corner, applies opposite
       lock, and accelerates. Behind it a second and then a third
       Ferrari, all Testa Rossas -- all in Ferrari Vermillian -- and
       then two other Ferraris, Competition 3-litres.

       The CROWD is beside itself, a river of red roars from the
       Brescia road into their square with ear shattering screams
       and roars --

       ON DE PORTAGO'S 335, as it emerges from the walls and
       accelerates.

                           NELSON
                  Jesus!

       DE PORTAGO'S eyes widen -

216   INT. DE PORTAGO'S 335. DAY.                              216

      AHEAD of him is a solid wall of people. The road narrows into
      a tunnel of cheering youths.
                                                                95.


                           NELSON
                 Wiggle the wheel.

       The nose of the Ferrari hunts one way and then the other --
       at one hundred and sixty miles an hour.

       With a roar of delight and mock fear the centre of the crowd
       scrabbles out of the way of the approaching car.

       It roars in a raging blur through the narrow funnel vacated
       by the crowd with a foot to spare on either side.

       NELSON looks round.

                             NELSON (CONT'D)
                 Jesus...

                           DE PORTAGO
                 What's next?

       CLOSE: NELSON looks at his schoolboy map.


216A   EXT. APPROACHING FUTA PASS. CLOUDY MOUNTAIN PASS.        216A

       COLLINS is swallowed by mist, DE PORTAGO behind him.

       Ahead of them are the tail lights of GENDEBIEN's 250. COLLINS
       overtakes it.

       DE PORTAGO seeks to follow, but has to brake as the straight
       dips into a downward right hander.

       GENDEBIEN spirals down it with DE PORTAGO on his tail.

       Driving deeper into the gorge, the two cars snarl around a
       bulging rock-face down which cascades a mountain stream. The
       cars power right through it.


216B   EXT. APPROACHING FUTA PASS.                              216B

       The spectacular arched column spans a gorge -- across which
       GENDEBIEN and DE PORTAGO streak.

       Spectators crowd on all the trees and rocks.

       The road widens just after the bridge and DE PORTAGO again
       tries to pass. But he moves too early and shaves a concrete
       post.

       Notwithstanding the shattering impact -- he continues round
       the outside of GENDEBIEN and out-accelerates him up the hill.
                                                                 96.


       Scattered crowd, sitting on rocks, applauds his aggression.

       BEHRA thunders past, racing up onto DE PORTAGO's trail,
       catching up, making his move, challenging --

       CHITI follow. TOMMASO looks up.

                             FERRARI
                   Good morning, Tommaso.

                             TOMMASO

       He enters his office.


222    INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. DAY.                                222

       On the desk is Rancatti's article from the Automotive Gazette
       and a model of the new Testa Rossa. FERRARI picks it up, sits
       down, turns it upside down, spins the wheel.

       TAVONI and CHITI enter.

                             FERRARI
                   Sit down, gentlemen.

       They sit.

                             FERRARI (CONT'D)
                   Okay. Let's talk about Monaco...

       The phone rings. FERRARI picks it up.

                             FERRARI (CONT'D)
                   Yes?

                             TOMMASO (V.O.)
                   Signor Agnelli is on the phone.

                       (to the group)
                   Excuse me for one moment.

                          AGNELLI (V.O.)
                Ferrari, buongiorno.

                          FERRARI
                Buongiorno, Avocato.


223   INT. AGNELLI'S OFFICE. TURIN. DAY.                       223

      Cutting between the two locations:

                          AGNELLI
                I apologize for calling in the
                middle of the race, Ferrari. But I
                have this piece by Rancati in front
                of me that's so disturbing.

      FERRARI pulls forward the Automotive Magazine.

                          FERRARI
                Avocato, it's fiction. I have
                absolutely no idea where they get
                their stories.

      AGNELLI reacting to Ferrari's vehement denial, gestures to
      his associate: now he knows it's true.

                          AGNELLI
                This is important. Ferrari cannot
                go to foreigners. You're a national
                treasure.

      An edge creeps into FERRARI's voice.

                          FERRARI
                A "jewel in the crown of Italy--"

                            AGNELLI
                Exactly--

                          FERRARI
                Then why does the jewel have to
                scrimp to put its cars into every
                race?

                          AGNELLI
                If it's that bad, why didn't you
                call me?

                          FERRARI
                I did. You said no.

                          AGNELLI
                Impossible! When was this?
                                                        98.

          One word written on it: No.

                    AGNELLI
          That was a long time ago. In
          business each day is a new day.

                    FERRARI
          The personality of Fiat is
          timeless. And today the offer you
          would make would be full of
          conditions...

                    AGNELLI
          That is not so.

                    FERRARI
          My bosses would be bookkeepers in
          Turin --

                    AGNELLI
          We should talk this over -- if
          you're looking for financial
          assistance talk to me, please, not
          Ford.

FERRARI pauses.

                    AGNELLI (CONT'D)
          You're busy now. Call me after the
          race.

                    FERRARI
          I'll call you first thing tomorrow--

He puts the phone down and thinks, all in all, a good call.

He looks up at CHITI and TAVONI.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Where were we?

                    CHITI
          Monaco.
                                                                99.


      FERRARI nods.


224   EXT. ROME CHECKPOINT.                                      224

      COLLINS slams through the narrow city streets. A chaos of
      crowds on sidewalk leading into a Piazza, as TARUFFI, VON
      TRIPS and DE PORTAGO thunder in and brake hard for the pits
      at the end.

      On camera set-up...

                          TV COMMENTATOR
                Collins is the fastest ever to Rome
                in the history of this race. On his
                heels are three other drivers,
                Taruffi, Von Trips and, incredibly,
                Olivier Gendebien in the little
                250.

      In the Ferrari pits, the cars are refueled. MECHANICS crank
      the hand pumps, whilst more swarm around DE PORTAGO's car,
      trying to rectify the damage to his fender...

      LINDA, in a headscarf, slips through security, gives DE
      PORTAGO a hug.

                            LINDA
                Hi--

      DE PORTAGO is pleased to see her but is more concerned about
      what is being done to his car.

      Nearby in the piazza, BEHRA comes into the Maserati pits. He
      gets out as the TEAM starts changing the wheels. He looks
      cool and unflustered.

      Back in the Ferrari pits, GENDEBIEN's 250 speeds in as
      TARUFFI madly accelerates out, narrowly avoiding colliding.
      VON TRIPS follows TARUFFI out, forcing him to race for the
      exit.

      DE PORTAGO slips back into his seat anxious to get away but
      mechanics are still hammering, annoying him. He turns to
      LINDA.

                          DE PORTAGO
                Meet me in Brescia.

      She leans in and kisses him.

                           LINDA
                Tonight? I can't.
                                                             100.


                           CHIEF MECHANIC
                    (interrupting)
                When you get to Bologna, change the
                rubber. I'11 call ahead.

      DE PORTAGO nods. With certainty --

                           DE PORTAGO
                    (to Linda)
                I am going to win. I want you to be
                there--

      LINDA kisses him passionately.

                            LINDA
                I'll try.

                          CHIEF MECHANIC
                Watch out for sheep on the Futa.

      NELSON slides in beside him.

                          DE PORTAGO
                You know the way from here?

      NELSON nods. DE PORTAGO accelerates across the square --

      On the other side of which BEHRA tries to beat him to the
      exit, but fails -- to a roar from the crowd. The two cars
      stampede out heading north for the hills.


225   EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS. DAY.                                    225

      COLLINS comes over the brow of the hill. Behind him is
      TARUFFI. VON TRIPS is on his heels. Then, behind this pack is
      a second.

      Behind DE PORTAGO is GENDEBIEN. And behind GENDEBIEN, here
      comes BEHRA in the big Maserati. As they hit the undulating
      but straight road on top of the plateau, BEHRA begins to
      overtake GENDEBIEN'S 250 GT. They're side by side. BEHRA
      powers ahead, now challenging DE PORTAGO.


226   OMITTED                                                     226


227   INT. THE FOYER. HOTEL GRAND HOTEL MAJESTIC. BOLOGNA. DAY. 227

      The foyer is crowded with FERRARI OWNERS, ENGINEERS,
      JOURNALISTS, REPORTERS, and FERRARIISTAS.
                                                               101.


      FERRARI makes his entrance in dark glasses. There is a buzz
      of applause and shouts of 'Bravo, Commendatore!' A COUPLE OF
      RADIO MEN attempt to get a comment. On a small platform a
      period TV camera is interviewing two executives from Fiat.

      He moves past towards the desk --

      He reaches the desk, takes a great bunch of flowers out of
      the vase. The RECEPTIONIST, with a grin, accepts a $20 tip
      and directs FERRARI to the elevator. He signals, "No" and
      crosses to the stairs.


228   EXT. THE LOBBY. SECOND FLOOR. THE GRAND HOTEL MAJESTIC. DAY.
                                                               228

      FERRARI arrives and walks down the hall towards his usual
      suite. The door which precedes it opens and a female arm
      comes out and hauls him inside.


229   INT. BEDROOM. FERRARI ROOM. GRAND HOTEL MAJESTIC. DAY.      229

      The door opens revealing FERRARI holding a bouquet of flowers
      with an ironic smile. Entering, he presents LINA with the
      bouquet. They embrace.

      There's room service with coffee, light food on the table
      that she had ordered.

                          LINA
                How much time?

                          FERRARI
                The first cars arrive in an hour...
                at about half past two.

      FERRARI sits on the bed and falls back and pulls her down
      next to him. She lies in his arms. A moment of repose from
      his war of survival, their dilemma, coaching five drivers in
      the Mille Miglia and the contest of the race itself.


230   EXT. MOUNTAINS. DAY.                                        230

      BEHRA passes and is now ahead of DE PORTAGO. DE PORTAGO tucks
      into BEHRA's slipstream. It's silent, there.

      A corner is coming up, a dipping right-hander.

      Then, DE PORTAGO sling shots out and starts to pull even with
      BEHRA. DE PORTAGO and BEHRA, aware of each others presence,
      hold their speed. NELSON closes his eyes.
                                                      101A.


The line for the turn cuts the apex midway through on the
inside.
                                                             102.


      BEHRA edges forward, looks at DE PORTAGO. DE PORTAGO edges
      even - it's a challenge. Two objects cannot occupy the same
      space at the same moment in time. De Portago or Behra. A
      repeat of the French Grand Prix. One must brake! Neither
      does. Wheels touch!

      And BEHRA goes over the edge.

      DE PORTAGO slews the back of his Ferrari round, tries
      opposite lock nearly loses it, hits the inside of the cutting
      on the rebound, damages a strip of the fender and straightens
      up -- and goes like the clappers downhill.

      NELSON looks up. They're still alive. Looks round. There's no
      sign of Behra.


231   EXT. MOUNTAINS. DAY.                                       231

      BEHRA's car is plunging down the side of the steep slope like
      a damaged aircraft.

      Unseen boulders kick off the wheels, the fenders, the
      exhaust. It surfs its way towards the road below. In the
      distance the four Ferraris, having rounded the hairpin, are
      switching back on what seems like a collision course.

      Finally, the Maserati half tumbles, half lands onto the road,
      followed by debris.

      BEHRA clambers slowly out of the wreck.

      TARUFFI avoids the debris and brakes when he sees BEHRA.

      He reverses back to where he stands, lifts his goggles from
      his blackened face and grins.

                          TARUFFI
                Took the short cut, uh?

      He waves Behra in, giving him a lift.


232   EXT. BOLOGNA CHECKPOINT (GAS STATION). DAY.                232

      It's an AGIP gas station on a heavily treaded street. The
      atmosphere among the half dozen Ferrari mechanics is
      jubilant. Ferrari had dropped off tires. COLLINS' 335 skids
      to a halt beside the gas pump. FERRARI is waiting to greet
      him.
                                                         103.


FERRARI grabs COLLINS in two hands.

                    FERRARI
          Everything OK?

                    COLLINS
          The transmission's gone. I don't
          know whether it's gears or the back
          axle...

Behind him, CHITI is already checking the drive-train.

A MECHANIC offers COLLINS a banana, which COLLINS begins to
peel.

                    COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Who's behind me?

                    FERRARI
          Everyone. You're in the lead.

                    COLLINS
          Yes. What about Moss?

                    FERRARI
          Dropped out--

                    COLLINS
          When?

                    FERRARI
          Before Padua.

                    COLLINS
          Why didn't you tell me?

COLLINS doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.

                    FERRARI
          You had Behra to take care of.

                    COLLINS
          I was worried about Moss!

                    FERRARI
          They're both out.
                                                       104.


COLLINS grins through his tears --

                    COLLINS
          But I've fucked the transmission!

                    FERRARI
          Peter, you can do it. Take it easy--

COLLINS hands the rest of the banana to FERRARI and gets back
into the cockpit.

FERRARI hands the half eaten banana to CHITI, who hands it to
TAVONI, who hands it to a MECHANIC, who hands it to a group
of BOYS.

                    MECHANIC
          You want Collins banana?

The THREE KIDS grab it.

COLLINS revs the engine, lets out the clutch.

As he takes off. A roar from the bystanders.

Almost colliding with outgoing Mercedes which brakes, COLLINS
roars off as VON TRIPS and TARUFFI pull in.

BEHRA climbs out, holds out his hand. TARUFFI shakes it.

Then both men get out of the car, whereupon BEHRA is
surrounded by REPORTERS. But he won't talk to them. He waves
his gloves at FERRARI, who gives him a respectful nod...

BEHRA finishes the long walk across the square, to where the
ORSIS, dumbfounded by the turn of events, await him. On their
faces the realization that this is the end of the road for
Maserati.

FERRARI, charged...

                    FERRARI
          Taruffi! I give you a brand new
          car. Look at it!

TARUFFI has pulled into the bay. As the PIT TEAM refuel the
car he staggers out of the cockpit, trying to straighten his
stiff legs.

                    TARUFFI
          Brand new? The back axle's bent.
          I've got only first, third and
          fourth gears.
                                                      104A.


                    FERRARI
          Any more damage, Taruffi, you pay
          for.

TARUFFI dismisses this with a wave as he staggers towards the
portable lavatory.

                    TAVONI
          Commendatore.

FERRARI finds CHITI and TAVONI facing him.

                    CHITI
          Now that Maserati is out--

                    TAVONI
          We're in danger of running the cars
          into the ground.

                    CHITI
          Order the drivers to hold their
          positions

                    FERRARI
          Why bother? They won't.
                                                       105.


                    CHITI
          But if we continue at this pace--

                    TAVONI
          For the future of the factory--

                    FERRARI
          -- my factory is built on racing.
          They are racers.

OPTIONAL: FERRARI touches his temple. GENDEBIEN sits in his
couple as it's being refueled.

FERRARI crosses to him.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Problems, Olivier?

GENDEBIEN shakes his head.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          You're way ahead of your class.

                    GENDEBIEN
          To hell with my class. I'm going to
          win this outright.

                    FERRARI
          You can do it. Collins' back axle's
          gone, there's a problem with
          Taffy's transmission. That leaves
          Taruffi and he's lost a gear.

                    GENDEBIEN
          So, it's me and de Portago--

At which point DE PORTAGO storms in towards the checkpoint
and gas station.

TARUFFI comes back, zipping up his overalls, as DE PORTAGO'S
335 pulls in.
                                                       106.


NELSON jacknifes out for a piss, DE PORTAGO eases himself out
to take a mug of coffee offered by a MECHANIC.

Meanwhile --

                     TARUFFI
              (to Ferrari)
          I think I can do it--

                    FERRARI
          You better, you geriatric. If you
          don't finish in the first three,
          your wife will never speak to you
          again. Nor will your children.

Taruffi turns the starter motor.

                       FERRARI (CONT'D)
          Go for it.

To a great cheer, TARUFFI accelerates up the parkway. VON
TRIPS chases after him.

FERRARI approaches him, MECHANICS swarm over DE PORTAGO'S
car.

                    DE PORTAGO
          How's Behra?

                       FERRARI
          He's okay.

                    DE PORTAGO
          He kept coming.

                    FERRARI
          He brakes. You pass. You brake. He
          passes. Or no one brakes...

DE PORTAGO's composure vanishes.

                    DE PORTAGO
          What's going on here?

On the far side, FOUR MECHANICS have rolled forward new tires
for Portago's Borrani wheels ... notorious for the time they
take to change.

                    FERRARI
          You need new rubber.

                     DE PORTAGO
          I don't have time - check the
          pressures.
                                                       107.


A WOMAN breaks through the cordon and pushes a bunch of
flowers into DE PORTAGO's hands. He is courteous enough to
smile a thank-you before she is bundled away.

                    FERRARI
          Chiti, check the tires.

                    DE PORTAGO
          Nelson, did you check the front
          offside?

NELSON is back from the toilet.

                    NELSON
          Yes. It's okay.

He swings himself into his seat. DE PORTAGO turns to FERRARI:
the frustration that he feels is palpable.

                    DE PORTAGO
          Come on Ferrari! We're wasting
          time.

                     FERRARI
              (to Chiti)
          Chiti, check the front offside.

As DE PORTAGO levers himself into the cockpit, he hands the
flowers to NELSON and starts the engine.

FERRARI inspects the nearside tires -- thoroughly.

                    NELSON
          Come on. They're good.

                    FERRARI
          Chiti!

CHITI appears on the far side of the 335.

                    CHITI
          They're worn.

                    DE PORTAGO
          Will it get us to Brescia?

CHITI hesitates.

OPTIONAL: GENDEBIEN pulls in.

DE PORTAGO puts his foot down and the car surges forward.

CHITI, TAVONI and FERRARI watch it roar across the square.
                                                      107A.


As it reaches the Via Marconi, NELSON throws the flowers
away. They scatter over his shoulder in the afternoon sun.
                                                               108.


      It is an image that was to stay with FERRARI for a long time:
      the red rear end of the car, the raised leather glove, palm
      open, the scattering flowers.


233   EXT. LARGO GARIBALDI. DAY.                                  233

      LAURA -- carrying a shopping bag full of groceries -- nears
      her door. A van with a television mounted on its roof is
      parked outside. Around the door are THREE PHOTOGRAPHERS.

      She fishes for her keys, ONE PHOTOGRAPHER calls out --

                          PHOTOGRAPHER
                Signora, why aren't you in Bologna
                with your husband?

      LAURA retorts with spirit.

                          LAURA
                Why aren't you?

      This gets a laugh. She opens the door, smiling.


234   INT. KITCHEN SECOND FLOOR. LARGO GARIBALDI. DAY.            234

      LAURA enters with the shopping and dumps it on the table.

      ADALGISA has been sitting watching television. But on LAURA'S
      arrival she turns it off.

      LAURA catches a furtive look on her face, senses it has
      something to do with the television. She turns the TV back
      on. As the picture appears, it shows FERRARI in close-up -
      mid interview - talking to REPORTERS from the lobby of the
      Majestic Hotel in Bologna as he's leaving the hotel. LINA is
      in the background.

      Instinctively, LAURA knows it is LINA. She looks cool, poised
      and carries a bunch of yellow flowers. Laura points at Lina,
      touches her on the screen.

                          COMMENTATOR
                Signor Ferrari? Who's going to win?

                          FERRARI
                It could be any of the first five.

                          COMMENTATOR
                What about Gendebien's 250?
                                                             109.


                          FERRARI (V.O.)
                He demonstrates that even the
                smallest Ferrari can compete at the
                highest level--

      LAURA turns. ADALGISA is already leaving the room.

                          LAURA
                You knew about her, and you never
                told me!

      ADALGISA retreats, steady under fire.

                          ADALGISA
                He is entitled to an heir.

                          LAURA
                I gave him one!

      ADALGISA from the doorway turns, faces her --

                          ADALGISA (V.0.)
                As it turns out, one was not
                enough.

      LAURA takes one last look at the television. FERRARI has
      turned away. LINA is caught half turning, smiling a shy
      goodbye.

      All LAURA's pent up rage is released. She screams.


235   INT. FARM HOUSE. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                         235

      A family is eating on a long table under the barrel-vaulted
      ceiling in the large stone farm house including a MOTHER in
      her late `20s, a robust woman --

                          MOTHER
                Enrico, go back, wash your hands.

      The EIGHT YEAR OLD SON goes to the utility sink and turns the
      single faucet.

      His FATHER is watching news unrelated to the Mille Miglia on
      the black and white television.

      His THREE YEAR OLD BROTHER is eating tortellini with his
      hands and a spoon.
                                                                110.


236    EXT. THE STRAIGHT ROAD TO GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                236

       The five red dots hurtle down the dead straight road.
       COLLINS, TARUFFI, DE PORTAGO, GENDEBIEN and VON TRIPS.


237    INT. COLLINS' CAR. DAY.                                    237

       He sees an intersection. A crowd of people, young and old --
       are pressing to the side of the road.

       HIS POV - the road ahead.

       The crowd has spilled over the edge of the road. He is
       closing in on them at nearly a 100 yards a second.


237A   EXT. INTERSECTION. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY                        237A

       COLLINS passes in a storm of stone and dirt -- inches from
       the faces of the kids.

       POV -- from just behind the front wheel. A blur passes of
       spring flowers, legs, dogs, cheering from the kid's faces.

       TARUFFI screams past followed by a gap and then DE PORTAGO,
       GENDEBIEN and VON TRIPS. Like nesting birds a few amateur
       photographers record the event from the side of the road. One
       from the branches of a tree.


238    INT. FARMHOUSE. DAY                                        238

       The family tableau and newscast is split by the shriek of the
       raw V12's at high revs, still distant. The sound is like a
       rend in the air.

                           EIGHT YEAR OLD SON
                 They're coming!

       And, he runs out the door, followed by his slower, younger
       brother.

                            FATHER
                     (after)
                 Antonio!

       He rises to run after them --


239    EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                      239

       COLLINS and then TARUFFI pass. A gap.
                                                      110A.


And now it is DE PORTAGO racing in pursuit of COLLINS through
the rows of poplar trees on both sides, carrying their
implications, perhaps of fatedness.

ON DE PORTAGO - intent to catch them, only 20 minutes from
Brescia and the finish line.
                                                               111.


A239A   EXT. THE STRAIGHT ROAD. THE FARMHOUSE. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY A239A

        The FATHER hustles the THREE YEAR OLD BROTHER away. As he
        looks back --


B239A   EXT. THE STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY                B239A

        COLLINS BLASTS through.

        The family group to the north of the pathway to the house,
        their thrilled reactions --


C239A   EXT. THE STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY                C239A

        STATIC CAMERA ON DE PORTAGO hurtling red projectile between
        the even rows of poplars coming out of the curve to camera.


D239A   EXT. THE STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY                D239A

        ON DE PORTAGO - the intensity and determination, less than 20
        minutes from the finish line in Brescia his face darkened
        with the grit of the 10 hours racing so far.


239A    EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                   239A

        The distant red projectile racing at us.

        PULL FOCUS to TIGER'S EYE. This one is broken, has a sharp
        edge.

        SLOW MO De Portago's tire hits it. See the laceration and
        explosive force of the hot air ripping through the
        laminations.


A239B   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                  A239B

        ON REAR De Portago's 335. The left front slowed we SEE the
        rear swing to the right.


B239B   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                  B239B

        OVER DE PORTAGO as his rear comes out he counters by steering
        to the right and coming on to the gas to gain adhesion so
        that he can steer back onto the road and straighten the car.

        ...he stamps to the right to regain traction so he can steer
        left and straighten out the car...
                                                                 111A.


C239B   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                     C239B

        ALONG RIGHT SIDE CU RIGHT FRONT TIRE...but he's too far right
        and slams into a concrete mile marker.


D239B   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                     D239B

        600fps ON DE PORTAGO'S RIGHT FRONT TIRE driving into and
        exploding the concrete mileage marker. As it explodes...


E239B   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                     E239B

        WIDE FRONTAL ON ROAD. De Portago's 335 is twisted sideways -
        his axis perpendicular to the road - and launches into the
        air. It gains lift, the car acting like a wing as it rolls
        and - seemingly benign - is airborne.


239B    EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                      239B

        The faces whip towards the oncoming car and begin to react in
        milliseconds.


239C    EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                      239C

        ON THE CAR it rolls until part of the car, probably the rear,
        hits the telephone pole snapping it half. That sends part of
        the car towards the crowd as shrapnel and changes the
        trajectory.


239D    EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY.                      239D

        Now the car is tumbling end over end at somewhere between 120-
        140mph. Most of the car and pieces of it that exploded off
        slam into the onlookers, coming apart.


240     EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLO. DAY                         240

        Remnants of the LOCAL FAMILIES, screaming with horror.

        Dust obscures the road -- shapes of CHILDREN can be glimpsed
        wandering confused through it. ADULTS pulling them clear as
        the next cars bear down on them--

                                                           CUT TO
                                                            111B.


241   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. DAY. LATER              241

      A YOUNG PRIEST makes his way down the hill, bearing in one
      hand a chalice, in the other a round wafer of bread.

      He moves slowly, as if in a dreamworld, into what seems like
      a battlefield of drifting smoke and doll-like bodies. Through
      the shrapnelled wood, we make out the wreckage of the red
      racing car.

      We glimpse in the wreckage and escaping steam from the
      destroyed car the crushed body De Portago. The hand of a
      YOUNG PRIEST places a holy wafer in the open mouth of ALFONSO
      DE PORTAGO'S head, torn from its body.


242   EXT. THE SQUARE AT BRESCIA. CELEBRATION. DAY             242

      A scene of unalloyed joy. A brass band is playing. There is a
      carnival atmosphere.
                                                             112.


      TARUFFI, the winner, his face blackened by oil spray stands
      among the equally darkened GENDEBIEN and VON TRIPS. All three
      hold Trophies, as people shower them with champagne and
      flowers...

      LINDA CHRISTIAN moves eagerly through the crowd, huge smile
      from the excitement around her.

      COLLINS and KLEMANTANSKI get out of a Ferrari van -- still in
      their racing garb. Their faces are carbon black. They look
      shell shocked. LOUISE, tearful, greets them, holds Collins
      tightly. KLEMANTANSKI hugs her.

      LINDA is swept towards the ramp, she spots them and waves.

                          LINDA
                Where's Fon?


243   EXT. STRAIGHT ROAD. GUIDIZZOLLO. NIGHT                      243

      The wood is lit by the glare of television lights and the
      headlamps of ambulances and the Fire Service.

      BODIES are being carried upwards on stretchers.

      A CARABINIERI car, its lights flashing, comes to a halt,
      CHITI's big Alfa behind him and behind him the Ferrari Works'
      vans.

      FERRARI gets out of the Alfa and wades into the scene. CHITI
      and TAVONI follow.

      A POLICEMAN points out the ditch where the bulk of the car
      had impacted...

      FERRARI walks to the ditch, followed by CHITI, TAVONI. The
      locals mill around, trying to help; relatives in shock. No
      one seems aware he's there.

      He looks around. Bodies, some swathed in plastic, are being
      removed.

      FERRARI looks up into the trees. Bits of the 335 are still
      lodged there.

      A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER arrives, he knows FERRARI --

                          SENIOR POLICE OFFICER
                Commendatore?

      CHITI produces a letter from the Parma police to collect the
      car. While FERRARI wanders off--
                                                               113.


      FERRARI's devastated. He'd learned to steel himself
      (somewhat) to the deaths of drivers. This brutal savagery
      wrought upon ordinary people by metal bearing his name, the
      bloody carnage of it, tears him apart.

      A FEMALE VOICE cries out in the darkness -- and FERRARI looks
      up to see a woman, tearing away from the crowd of relatives
      and onlookers, running towards the carnage, her bodice
      stained with blood. It's the MOTHER from the farmhouse.
      Police and firemen stop her and she breaks down in their
      arms.

      FERRARI's frozen in the sea of carnage.


244   INT. DE PORTAGO'S ROOM. MARZOTTO HOTEL. NIGHT.             244

      Darkness. A light comes on. LINDA CHRISTIAN enters and shuts
      the door. She surveys the room.

      Fon and Eddie's dry cleaning hang neatly on the rail. His
      half open grip stands on a luggage rack. Her photograph is
      stuck in the mirror alongside a picture of his family.
      Underneath are two envelopes.

      She crosses and picks them up. One is addressed to her. She
      sits down on the bed, opens it, lights a cigarette and reads.

                           DE PORTAGO (V.O.)
                My darling Linda. Tomorrow may be
                the last day of my life. So I'm
                writing to you, but in the firm
                expectation that: you will never
                have to...

      She reads on... a tear begins to flow down her cheek... She
      pulls back her hair in a characteristic determined gesture
      and keeps reading.


245   FLASHBACK - INT. PALAZZO. HALL. MODENA. DAY                245

      DE PORTAGO enters from a morning run. He kicks off his low-
      cut black track shoes.

      A Housemaid starts down the stairs with a tray, having
      brought Linda coffee.

                          DE PORTAGO
                Linda? Are you up?

                           LINDA (V.O.)
                    (distant)
                I'm upstairs.
                                                             114.


      DE PORTAGO grins, pulls off his shirt -- strips. The
      Housemaid looks away. DE PORTAGO, now naked, takes the stairs
      three at a time.

                          DE PORTAGO
                I'm coming.

      He leaps from one giant step to the other and neither
      slackening pace nor shortening stride continues to bound up
      the stairs from one flight to the next -- up two flights, to
      burst into her bedroom, stark bollock naked and so very much
      ALIVE.

                          LINDA
                Fon! Are you crazy?

                            DE PORTAGO
                Yes!

      She barely sets the coffee on the side table and dives her
      head under the covers as he leaps on the bed.

      He cocoons her in the duvet, but she escapes and wraps one
      arm around his neck--

                          LINDA
                Come here, you!

      She pulls him into a kiss that gets serious in the yellow
      morning light streaming in.




246   INT. DE PORTAGO'S ROOM. MARZOTTO HOTEL. NIGHT.              246

      She finishes reading the letter and curls up on the bed.

                            LINDA
                Oh, Fon--


247   EXT. BONEYARD. FACTORY. MARANELLO. MIDNIGHT                 247

      The factory is back from Brescia. They are in the process of
      unloading cars plus Collins' abandoned 335. In the cold light
      of the arc lamps, dented and covered in mud, the cars look
      completely driven out.

      The MECHANICS work in an unacustomed silence. The terrible
      events at Guidizzolo are with them.

      FERRARI is there, supervising the unloading.
                                                              115.


      Every minute brings a new truck or tanker through the gates.
      Now, a van rolls in, carrying the wreck of de Portago's
      machine. Suddenly all work in the yard stops. FERRARI calmly
      orders it towards the boneyard.


248   INT. OFFICE BLOCK. FACTORY. MARANELLO. NIGHT.             248

      CUOGHI and RANCATI have been recruited to help answer a
      torrent of calls. CUOGHI is working out of Ferrari's office.
      RANCATI out of Tavoni's. TOMMASO is at his usual desk in the
      outer office.

                           TOMMASO
                    (on the phone)
                The Commendatore is not available--

                           RANCATI
                    (on the phone)
                No. Signor Ferrari is not available
                to answer your questions.

                           CUOGHI
                    (on the phone)
                Enzo has his hands full at the
                moment -- I will tell him you
                called.


249   INT. THE BONEYARD. FACTORY. MARANELLO. NIGHT.             249

                          FERRARI
                Here.

      The chassis of De Portago's 335 is being dismembered.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                Wheels over there. Hood here.
                Trunk...

      The wheels, the cockpit, the twisted metal of hood and trunk
      are now off-loaded and stacked separately.

      FERRARI stares at the wreckage. It is unrecognizable.

      A vision of the demented young woman swims before his eyes
      running down through the trees, her dress red with blood.

      CHITI kneels down by the front offside wheel, examines it.

      FERRARI bends over and gently teases out a flower from behind
      the transmission tunnel.
                                                              116.


      CHITI turns over the wheel. It is buckled, the spokes
      unsprung, the rim driven back to the boss. Most tellingly,
      there is a long straight gash from external damage.

      FERRARI studies the flower.

                          CHITI
                This wheel hit a kerb stone, a
                brick, something solid that cut it.
                It wasn't the tire.

      CHITI examines it. The shredded rubber is tangled around it
      like seaweed. CHITI is trying to reassure him.

      FERRARI picks up the phone and dials the operator. On the
      desk the flower sits in a vase.

                          FERRARI
                Brescia, please...

      And he gives the number....


252   INT. BAR. BRESCIA. NIGHT.                                   252

      A BARMAN threads his way through the dancers on the crowded
      dance floor to the crowded Ferrari table. He says something
      to TARUFFI who gets to his feet and follows him back towards
      the bar. WOMEN want to kiss him, MEN shake his hand.


253   INT. FERRARI'S OFFICE. FACTORY. NIGHT.                      253

                          FERRARI
                Piero?

      TARUFFI comes on line --

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                It's Enzo. I wanted to congratulate
                you.

      TARUFFI mentions the crash at Guidizzolo.   He's concerned.

                          FERRARI (CONT'D)
                What happened is separate from your
                victory today, that will go into
                the history books...

                            FERRARI (CONT'D)
                     (he attempts a joke)
                 Of course your car is a mess. I
                 shall send you a bill.
                     (as Piero rises to the
                       bait, he cuts him off)
                 Goodnight Piero, once again I
                 salute you, and all my love to your
                 incredibly beautiful, long
                 suffering, immeasurably tolerant
                 wife.

       He puts the phone down.

       There is another number on the page. He picks up the phone
       again -

                           FERRARI (CONT'D)
                 Brescia, please...

       And again he gives the number written neatly in purple in his
       diary.


A254   FLASHBACK. BOLOGNA. DAY.                                A254

       The vision of the flowers once again. The opening leather
       gloved hand, the floating blossoms swept up in the wind -


254    INT. DE PORTAGO'S ROOM. BRESCIA. NIGHT                      254

       The phone rings by the bedside. LINDA lies curled up on de
       Portago's bed. She lets it ring for some time before
       answering it.

                           LINDA
                 Yes?

       Intercut with Ferrari's office.

                            FERRARI
                 Linda? Ferrari speaking. I want to
                 say how sorry I am.
                     (long pause, she says
                      nothing)
                 I know how much he meant to you.

       Silently she begins to cry but it doesn't affect her voice.

                            LINDA
                 Don't worry. I don't blame you. Fon
                 knew and embraced the dangers.
                     (silence, then)
                                                             118.


                          FERRARI
                Is there anyway I can help?

                          LINDA
                It's you who needs help, Enzo.

      She gently puts the phone down. He's shattered. As he sits
      there, TOMMASO knocks on the door.

                          TOMMASO
                The Police are on their way from
                Rome. They want the car. Tavoni's
                going to stay and handle it. The
                press are outside the gate.

      FERRARI shakes his head.

      He looks at him.

      As he exits, FERRARI picks up the single bloom.

256   INT. THE BONEYARD. FACTORY. MARANELLO. NIGHT.               256

      Almost as if in a vigil, FERRARI sits in semi-darkness
      staring at the wreck of the 335. SCAGLIETTI's feet can be
      heard, but he neither looks up nor round at his approach.

      SCAGLIETTI enters and stares at the car. An attempt had been
      made to piece it together but it looks utterly destroyed.

                          SCAGLIETTI
                Lina called me. She wants me to
                bring you there--

      FERRARI doesn't reply. SCAGLIETTI walks close to take a
      critical look at the vehicle.    After all he'd built it.

                          SCAGLIETTI (CONT'D)
                What happened?

      FERRARI stirs but doesn't answer.

                          SCAGLIETTI (CONT'D)
                We all know death is nearby.

      FERRARI nods.
                                     118A.


          FERRARI
Children don't know. Blood spilled
because of metal that I made.

                 How's the bird?

                           SCAGLIETTI
                 Still in the cage.

                            FERRARI
                 Sensible creature.
                     (pause)
                 I have to talk to those vultures.
                 Then drive me home.


257    INT. SCAGLIETTI'S OLD PICKUP. YARD. FACTORY. NIGHT.      257

       SCAGLIETTI behind the wheel, driving --

                             SCAGLIETTI
                 The farm?

                            FERRARI
                 No. Largo Garibaldi.
                     (beat)
                 Phone Lina for me, will you? Tell
                 her I'll call. Maybe tomorrow. I
                 have business.

       SCAGLLIETTI nods, his feature's expressionless -- but he's
       thinking. This bird is going back into it's cage.


258    EXT. LARGO GARIBALDI. MODENA. NIGHT.                     258

       FERRARI gets out. He looks up at the house. The upper floors
       are dark. He starts towards the entrance.

       FERRARI lets himself in.

       ON THE TELEVISION: a MOB OF REPORTERS and TELEVISION NEWSMEN
       surround Ferrari at the factory.
                                    119A.


           FERRARI (V.O.)
Italy is looking for a scapegoat.
Here I am.
                                                       120.


An explosion of questions and FLASHBULBS. Ferrari exits
through the gate back into factory. TAVONI addresses them --

                    TAVONI (V.O)
          The tires were identical to the
          tires on the race winning cars of
          Taruffi and Gendebien. Nothing went
          wrong with the tires -- Portago had
          no problem with his.

It cuts to a COMMENTATOR, who speaks into camera:

                    COMMENTATOR
          The feeling in Rome is someone is
          responsible, must bear the blame.
          Why did Ferrari -- allow de Portago
          to proceed after his car received
          frontal damage? He may be charged
          with the crime--

FERRARI's footsteps on the stairs.

LAURA with only a cluster of candles lit and the television
on, turns off the volume. FERRARI enters. A shaft of half
light bleeds in from the adjacent room or the foyer after
Ferrari enters.

                       FERRARI
          No lights?

                     LAURA
          I've got a headache.
              (beat)
          The phone's been ringing all night!
          I took it off the hook.

FERRARI comes into view.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          You're in real trouble. To do with
          the tires. The press are competing
          for who can vilify you the most--

                    FERRARI
          There was nothing wrong with the
          tires. He hit something. Did you
          take any calls?

                    LAURA
          From the Gazette. Ugolini

                    FERRARI
          What did you tell him?
                                                        121.


                    LAURA
          I told him to fuck himself. And
          then that man from Autosport? I
          told him to fuck himself. And then
          Henry Ford --

                     FERRARI
          -- Ford?

                     LAURA
          -- I told him --
              (she hesitates)
          -- to call back.

FERRARI breathes more easily.

                    FERRARI
          Anyone else?

                    LAURA
          Cuoghi. I told him to go fuck
          himself. After that I took the
          phone off the hook.

                     FERRARI
              (ironic)
          Great.

ADALGISA peers in the doorway, fully dressed beside a
suitcase.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          What are you doing, mama?

                    ADALGISA
          I'm all packed. When do we leave?

                    FERRARI
          We're not going anywhere -- go back
          to sleep.

                    LAURA
          This is God's way of punishing us.

                     FERRARI
          Us? You think He slaughtered nine
          people in Guidizzolo to get even
          with you and me?
              (pause)
          As if we're not capable of
          inflicting enough on each other.
                                                       122.


LAURA shifts in her chair so that she can see both the silent
television and FERRARI.

                    FERRARI (CONT'D)
          There was a message from the bank.
          You cashed the check. They're
          calling insolvency experts. We're
          done.

LAURA listens, unblinkingly. In a calm voice --

                    LAURA
          The bank is getting hysterical over
          nothing.

                    FERRARI
          "Nothing?" You've bankrupted us!

                     LAURA
          Stop it. What good are you doing
          yourself.
              (mocks him)
          "I am a scapegoat--"a martyr."
              (pause)
          Who have you become, Saint
          Sebastian? You stand there and let
          them shoot arrows in your ass?

He looks at her.

                     LAURA (CONT'D)
          Go beat the hell out of them. The
          writers. Those hacks. Threaten
          them. Extort them. Those still on
          their feet -- the most
          sanctimonious and hypocritical --
          them, you give brown envelopes.
              (she points at brown
               envelopes stacked on the
               table)
          And they, too, then will discover --
          "perhaps the Sage of Maranello has
          been maligned unfairly. Moderation
          should reassert itself in the
          distinguished Italian press."
              (pause)
          And for that you need the cash.

And she indicates behind her banded stacks of bank notes.

FERRARI is silent. Before him is the younger Laura -- before
the war, before the tragedy of Dino's disease and death. No
one would suspect that in her current frame of mind she would
strategize and fund such an operation.
                                                       123.


FERRARI picks up a wad of money, looks at her.

                    LAURA (CONT'D)
          You thought I'd pack a suit case
          and go -- Yes?

FERRARI nods.

                    FERRARI
          It crossed my mind --

                    LAURA
          It crossed my mind, too --

And LAURA laughs. It's the second time that we have seen her
do so -- and we can see why Ferrari loved her.

                    FERRARI
          You're financing this?

                    LAURA
          Lending it.

                    FERRARI
          And the conditions are?

                     LAURA
          No conditions.
              (pause)
          There was a part of you in Dino. A
          warmth, joy, your wit. He had that.
              (pause)
          I had that from you in our early
          years. You gave it to your friends.
          But after a time, not to me. I got
          what was left when you came home
          from the fights in the factory. The
          ambition, drive, plots, paranoia.
          Even our fucking, as if that could
          save him. What I loved in you, I
          found in him. Okay? Now, that's
          gone.

LAURA has reached out across the table. FERRARI reaches out,
too, to hold her hand. He clutches hers firmly.

                      LAURA (CONT'D)
          There is   no condition. You have the
          money.
              (she   pauses)
          It is my   request. For my grief for
          our son,   for the years building
          this.
                      (MORE)
                                      123A.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
You do not acknowledge the boy with
the name Ferrari while I am alive.
                                                               124.


       Their eyes connect. In the background the TV plays silently.
       The fridge begins to hum.

       LAURA withdraws her hand slowly.

       FERRARI gets up, crosses the window, opens it, to show the
       first light of dawn. LAURA looks up wearily. FERRARI turns to
       her. He nods.

       Birds are singing, the cold sky is tinged with gold.

       FERRARI walks across the central court towards the Mausoleum.

       On a stone bench PIERO sits, wrapped in a coat, waiting for
       him. FERRARI, surprised, sits next to him.

                            FERRARI
                  What are you doing here? How'd you
                  get here?

                            PIERO
                  Giuseppe brought me.

                             FERRARI
                  Your mother sent him, she wants me
                  to come home?
                      (PIERO nods "yes")
                      (OPTIONAL:)
                  You're supposed to be in school?

       PIERO gives him a cynical look and shrugs.

                            FERRARI (CONT'D)
                  Have you been here before?

                              PIERO
                  No.

       New thought:

                            FERRARI
                  Your mother and you will come to
                  live in Modena.

                  Is the television reception better?
                                      124A.


          FERRARI
Much better. I can see the tower
from my window.

          PIERO
Did you get de Portago's autograph?
                                                       125.


                           FERRARI
                 I did.

      FERRARI stands, takes PIERO'S hand.

                            FERRARI (CONT'D)
                     (as they walk)
                 Come on, I'll introduce you to your
                 brother.

      As they walk towards the Mausoleum.

                           FERRARI (CONT'D)
                 I wish you could have known him. He
                 would have taken you with him
                 everywhere...

265   EPILOGUE                                           265

                           SCROLL
                 Ferrari, charged with manslaughter
                 over the accident at Guidizzolo,
                 was exonerated by the courts.

                 When Laura died, Piero was
                 officially recognized as Ferrari's
                 heir.

                 Peter Collin and Michael Hawthorne
                 were killed in racetrack and road
                 accidents in 1957 and 1959.

                 In the following year Ferrari
                 regained the World Championship.
                 The red cars became the dominant
                 force in motor racing and still
                 are.
