    THERMAL NIGHT VISION:
                                                                       
    A musical overture begins.   Inviting, descending.
                                                                       
    TITLE:   The Zone of Interest.   White letters.
                                                                       
    Gradually, the white letters fade as they cool, leaving us in
                                                                       
    blackness again as the music plays in descending patterns,
                                                                       
    for several minutes.
                                                                       
    The sound of birdsong emerges through the music, at first
                                                                       
    faintly. Cicadas too.
                                                                       
    The natural sounds punctuate the music more clearly, and then
                                                                       
    suddenly the black cuts sharply to...

    EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, LAKESIDE - DAY

    shore of a lake. Bright sunlight.

    Sat on a picnic blanket under a tree, is HEDWIG, (early
    40's), unassuming, wearing a swimming costume.

    She's feeding tiny slices of apple to their ten-month-old
    baby, ANNAGRET.

    Her TWO DAUGHTERS, HEIDERAUD (11) and INGE-BRIGIT (9), are
    playing and searching for wild strawberries in the long
    grass.

    ELFRYDA, (47), the German nanny, is lying in the shallows.
    HANS (6), is paddling nearby.

    CLAUS (14), and SHWARZER (30s), are playing together along
    the beach.

    Beyond them, RUDOLF, (early 40's), black short back and sides
                                                                       
    hair, black trunks, stands on the promontory looking out at
    the lake.

    Claus and Shwarzer join him and the three of them wade out
    into deeper water, up to their waists, slapping the water at
    each other with their arms.
                                                                       
    Then they push out into the shimmering lake.
                                                                       
    Their three heads bobbing in the water.

    The boys share the weight of the hamper. Hedwig in her straw

    Rudolf, dressed now, walks at the front, cradling baby

    Two 1940's cars wind their way along a forest road.

    They turn onto a country road.

    The glare from his headlights illuminates a rushing, black
    ribbon of road, and tall pine trees towering on either side,
    as dusk turns to night.
                                                                        
    The sound of the children play-singing and giggling in the

    The back of a two-story family house. Upstairs and
                                                                        
    downstairs rooms are lit by lights inside. Homely.
                                                                        
    Rudolf is visible through the window in a downstairs room.
                                                                        
    He turns off its light, and walks through its door.
                                                                        
    The lit windows go dark one by one as Rudolf moves from

    Rudolf and Hedwig lie in parallel but separate beds. Hedwig
                                                                        
    turns off her bedside lamp, lays her head on her pillow, and
                                                                        
    looks at her husband.
                                                                        
    Rudolf lies on his back in his bed, hands folded on his

    Empty hall with the back of a staircase leading down to it.
                                                                       
    At the top of the bannister a hand is supporting someone
                                                                       
    climbing tentatively down, as we hear off-screen the sound of
                                                                       
    three pairs of feet doing the same.

    the sound of two boys giggling.

              No, we'd never do that.

Claus unties the blindfold and whips it off his father.
                                                                  
Rudolf blinks in the bright summer morning sun and sees

               Oh, it was so funny. Of all the
               dresses she could have picked out,
               she chose one that belonged to some
               little Jewess half her size. I got
               the zip up to about here for her..
                   (indicates the small of
                    her back))
               ..and it quite literally..

                    her hands)
               ..like it was splitting. And I was
               trying to close it and close
               it..and jerking her around and all
               the time she's looking at herself
               saying "God I love it". Anyway, she
               took it. She said she'd lose weight
               so she could wear it.

     Sander is in mid-flow, using his pen to point as he explains

               The other side of it is the next
               chamber. In here is the next load

               Have been completely incinerated.

               In how long?

                         SANDER
               Seven hours. Four to five hundred
               at once.

                         PRUFER
               Closer to five hundred.

               So, once that's happened, you close
               this chimney. Then simultaneously
               open the next. The fire will follow
               the air, through this baffle of
               course, into this chamber and burn
               this load.

     We see the paper from above. Engineering plans. A ground

     continue to point as he speaks.

                          SANDER (CONT'D)                               
                                                                        
                In each case, the chamber directly
                opposite the fire zone, which is
                burning at around a thousand
                degrees, has by now cooled to
                around forty degrees. Cool enough
                to unload the ash then reload
                pieces.

                          RUDOLF
                So these chambers are cooling and
                                                                        
                these are heating up.

                          SANDER
                Correct. The process moves one
                chamber over, counterclockwise.
                Burn, cool, unload, reload.

     A YOUNG POLISH GIRL (15), holding a sack. She takes an apple

     Rudolf lies next to Inge-Brigit on top of her bed reading her
                                                                        
     Hansel and Gretel. She's under the sheet, her cheek resting
                                                                        
     on his shoulder as he reads, eyes closed. Flickering red
     light from outside dapples the bedroom wall.

     Rudolf pauses, and looks across at Heideraud. She's asleep.
                                                                        
     He glances at Inge-Brigit by his side. Fast asleep too.
                                                                        
     He gently closes the book.

     The Polish Girl is at the far end of the ditch. Empty sack in
                                                                        
     her hand. A trail of partially buried apples in the wall of
                                                                        
     the ditch behind her. She climbs out onto higher ground and

     Rudolf and Hedwig lie in their parallel but separate beds.

               Bracht phoned the house.

               Oh.

                         HEDWIG
               While you were outside for your
               toast. I forgot to tell you. He
               said he'd call back tomorrow.
               Midday.

     Rudolf nods.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               Will you take me to that Spa in
               Italy again?

                    HEDWIG
          All that pampering. And the walks.
          And that nice couple we met.
          I was just thinking about it. And
          remember the man playing accordion
          to the cows?

                    RUDOLF
              (pictures it)
          They loved it.

                    HEDWIG
          It was so funny.

                    RUDOLF
              (pulls a cow face)
          All looking at him like this.

Hedwig giggles.
                                                      
                       HEDWIG
          Will you?

                       RUDOLF
          What?

                    HEDWIG
          Take me back there.

                       RUDOLF
          Yes Mutzi.

                       HEDWIG
          When?

                    RUDOLF
          I don't know when.
              (cuddles up to her)
          Any better?

                       HEDWIG
          Mm.

                    RUDOLF
          You smell nice.

          Fran�ais.

                       RUDOLF

She giggles, then snorts.

                         RUDOLF (CONT'D)
               Oink, oink.

     Then giggles again at that.

                         HEDWIG
               Chocolate. If you see it. Any
               goodies.

     They both giggle. They both oink.

     EXT. SOLA RIVER - MORNING

     Rudolf paddles his canoe down the middle of the Sola River.
     Kneeling between his legs, his young passengers, Hans and
     Inge-Brigit.

     A light breeze rustles the tall bulrushes on either bank.
     Sunlight glistens off the water.

     EXT. HALL, H�SS VILLA, BACK GARDEN - MORNING

     Hedwig, Claus and Heideraud are gardening in the flowerbeds
     nearest the house.

     Hedwig is bent over with her hands in the earth, showing
     Claus what is a weed and what isn't.

     EXT. ROCKY INLET, SOLA RIVER - MORNING

     The canoe is moored on a small beach.
                                                                        
     Hans and Inge-Brigit splash in the shallows nearby, teasing
                                                                        
     each other.

     Rudolf stands waist deep in the river upstream, a fishing rod
     in his hand.

     He stands very still, focusing on his float in hope of a
     bite.

     He flinches suddenly. Looks down at the water he's standing
     in. Then returns his focus to the float.

     Then, feeling something brushing past his thigh, flinches
     again.

     He looks down at the water. He puts his hand in and pulls out
     a fragment of a bone.

     A human eye socket.

     We look at him through it.

     He drops it then wades out hurriedly.

     He throws down his rod on the bank and hurries along the
     shoreline, lapping dead fish, towards the children. Signaling
     for them to get out as he approaches.

                         RUDOLF
               Come on out. Out.

     They come to shore reluctantly.

     He towels them off anxiously.

     EXT. SOLA RIVER - DAY

     Rudolf is paddling back the way they came. The weather has
     changed and the children are shivering in front of him.
     Playfully making sounds through chattering teeth.

     He paddles hard through the choppy water.

47                                                                47
     INT. BATHROOM, H�SS VILLA - SHORT WHILE LATER

     Hans and Inge-Brigit are in the tub together, protesting as
     Hedwig kneels in front of them, scrubbing them with soap and
     brushes. Elfryda sings to distract them.

48                                                                48

     reading a book. But he seems distracted. In the background

     The telephone on his desk rings. He glances at his watch,
     then goes to answer it.

     Rudolf goes to turn off the radio. Then returns to the phone,

     Hedwig's mother, LINNA HENSEL (early 70's), is sat at the
     kitchen table, hot, sweaty and clutching a cool glass of
     lemonade.

                         RUDOLF
               Hello Linna.

                         LINNA
               Rudolf! Congratulations.
                   (an awkward embrace)
               What a strong little thing she is.

                         RUDOLF
               Isn't she. How are you?

                            LINNA
               Good.

                         RUDOLF
               How was the journey?

                         LINNA
               We stopped for ages at Krakow.

                         RUDOLF
               That's annoying.

                    LINNA
          And hot! A lady fainted next to me.
          She's moving here with her husband
          who's an engineer, he's a lot
          older. They've both got jobs at a
                                                               
          new factory. Siemens.

                    RUDOLF
          Ah, yes, that's possible.

                    LINNA
          `All the big companies are here' he
          said.

                    RUDOLF

          Yes, yes.

                    HEDWIG
                                                               
          Don't you need to get on?

          Yes. I'd better.

          I'll show mum to the girls room.

Linna starts to rise.

                    HEDWIG (CONT'D)
          Finish your drink first.

Hedwig hands Annagret to Elfryda. Rudolf enters the living
room and closes the door behind him.

                    HEDWIG (CONT'D)
          I can't believe you're here.

                     LINNA
          Finally.

                     HEDWIG
          Come.

They walk down the corridor.

                    HEDWIG (CONT'D)
          You'll have Heideraud's bed and
          she'll get in with Inge-Brigit. You
          don't mind do you?

                    LINNA
          Of course not.

               The house looks big but it actually
               isn't.

     They climb the stairs.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               First thing we did was install
               central heating. It gets so cold in
               winter you wouldn't believe it.

     Linna leans in to study them.

               Really?

     Hedwig shows Linna into the girl's room.
                                                                        
     Linna scans the room approvingly. Goes over to the window.

               This is Heideraud's bed here.

               lovely room.

     Hedwig watches, gratified.

                         HEDWIG
               The top two drawers are for you. I
               hope they'll be enough.

                         LINNA
               More than enough.

     Linna smells the freshly cut flowers displayed in a vase by

     Then looks at the bed.

     The both sit on a bed. Linna leans across and touches Hedwig

They arrive at the gazebo.

     Rudolf, now wearing a white suit with white shoes, is pacing
     up and down the patio, and smoking a cigarette agitatedly.

     The sound of splashing and laughter can be heard.

     Heideraud and her Schoolfriend, deep in chitchat, walk out
     the house and past him towards the upper garden.

     He grinds the cigarette with his heel, then walks down the
     steps.

     Claus is courting his GERMAN GIRLFRIEND at the side of the
     house. Away from prying eyes. They hold hands, they walk,
     they kiss, they giggle..

     EXT. TOP GARDEN, H�SS VILLA - CONTINUOUS

     Picnic tables and deckchairs facing the pool where the H�ss
                                                                        
     children and A FEW OF THEIR SCHOOL FRIENDS frolic and swim.
                                                                        
     Outdoor toys are strewn about. A big wooden train set lines
                                                                        
     one side of the pool. A child-sized teepee is pitched on the
                                                                        
     lawn.

     Rudolf walks over to the pool. Watches the kids play happily.
                                                                        
     Far back enough not to get his suit splashed.

     Some of the parents and nannies, sit chatting under the
     gazebo at the far end. He waves at them.
                                                                        
     Hedwig is in a lounger sunning herself. Linna is dozing in
     another nearby. The family's TWO PET TORTOISES trudge across
     the lawn.

     Rudolf walks over to Hedwig and sits down next to her.

     He leans forward. Elbows on knees. Sighs once.. long and
     deep.

                         HEDWIG
               Hans says you have his sandals.

                         RUDOLF
               We have to leave Mutzi.

                         HEDWIG
               Leave where?

                         RUDOLF
               Here. We have to go. We're being
               transferred.

                         HEDWIG
                   (lifts her sunglasses)
               Sorry.. what?

                         RUDOLF
               We're being transferred.

                           HEDWIG
               To where?

                         RUDOLF

                         HEDWIG
               ..What?

                         RUDOLF
               They want to swap me for Arthur
               Liebehenschel. He comes here. I
               take over as DI.

                         HEDWIG
               So why tell me that now?

                         RUDOLF
               There was no good moment to say it.
               It can wait.

                         HEDWIG
               You've said it now.

     Rudolf gets up, resigned, and walks back towards the house.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                         RUDOLF
               To get the sandals.

     Hedwig pulls herself out of her deckchair and follows,
     barefoot.

                         HEDWIG
               When did you know about this?

                         RUDOLF
               Pohl told me last week. I've been
               trying to make it go away.

     They reach the back door.

     INT. KITCHEN, H�SS VILLA - CONTINUOUS

     Hedwig follows him through the kitchen. Marta and Aniela are
     tidying away the picnic food.

                         HEDWIG
               Then call Bormann.

                         RUDOLF
               I've tried Bormann. Short of going
               to Hitler, I'm fucked.

     INT. LOBBY, H�SS VILLA - CONTINUOUS

     Rudolf walks down the corridor, opens the front door and
     exits.

     Hedwig stands in the open doorway, watching him quicken his
     step towards the front gate.

                         HEDWIG
                   (shouting at his back)
               Rudolf!

                         RUDOLF
               It's what's happening.

     She slams the front door.

     And slips in the same moment.

     Water on the floor by the lobby table in front of her.

                         HEDWIG
                   (calls)
               Marta!

     Marta hurries from the kitchen.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               Is this you?!

                          MARTA
                   (perplexed)
               Frau H�ss?

                          HEDWIG
                   (mocks her accent)
               Frau H�ss?
                   (a quick wrench of Marta's
                    hair)
               Mop it up. You are living well in
               our house, don't you forget that.

     Marta dashes to the kitchen. Hedwig catches her breath.
     Gathers her thoughts.

62                                                                62
     EXT. FRONT GARDEN, H�SS VILLA - SHORT WHILE LATER

     Hedwig, in shoes and cardigan now, walks purposefully down
     the front path to the gate. She opens it. Crosses the road,
     then takes the wooden steps down to the river..

     EXT. RIVER BANK, AUSCHWITZ - CONTINUOUS

     Rudolf stands on the bank. Hans's and Inge-Brigit's sodden
     sandals next to him. The canoe is moored to a small jetty
     nearby.

     He is throwing stones into the fast-flowing river.

     Hedwig arrives, goes over and stands next to him. Folds her
     arms. Looks around.

                         HEDWIG
               Why are they moving you?

                         RUDOLF
               Structural changes.

                         HEDWIG
               What does that mean?

                         RUDOLF
               They haven't been specific. But I'm
               not the only one being moved. There
               are lots of us.

                           HEDWIG
               When?

                           RUDOLF
               Soon.

                           HEDWIG
               How soon?

                         RUDOLF
               I'm waiting to be told.

                         HEDWIG
               If it's to do with the
               investigation, they should speak to
               Himmler. He encouraged us.

     Rudolf shakes his head.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               So it's not that?

                         RUDOLF
               It's politics.

                         HEDWIG
               Then go to Hitler.

          RUDOLF
Don't be ridiculous.

          HEDWIG
Why not? You're the one who
actually carries out his orders.
Once you peel away all the layers.

          RUDOLF
We have to face facts. We have to
leave.

          HEDWIG
You have to leave.

          RUDOLF
Well.
    (gobsmacked)
Well, well.

             HEDWIG
Your   work is in Oranienburg now.
Mine   is raising our children. And
I'll   do that from here thank you
very   much.

          RUDOLF
I never thought that you wouldn't
be with me. Never crossed my mind.

          HEDWIG
    (defiant)
They'd have to carry me out of
here.
    (getting upset)
This is our home. We're living how
we dreamed we would. Since we were
seventeen. Beyond how we dreamed.
Out of the city finally. Everything
we want. On our doorstep. And our
children strong and healthy and
                                             
happy. Everything the F�hrer said
about how we should live is exactly
how we do. Drive East. Lebensraum.
Here it is.
    (tears in her eyes)
I know you agree with me. Arthur
can find somewhere else to live.
You should make it a condition.
It's the least they can do. He'll
want a townhouse anyway. Rudi?

          RUDOLF
Yes, I heard you.
                                  Revision                      40.


                         HEDWIG
               So?

                         RUDOLF
               So. I'll, I'll ask, I'll speak to
               Pohl.

                         HEDWIG
               You'll be working all the time.

                         RUDOLF
               Yes.

                         HEDWIG
               We'd never see you.

                         RUDOLF
               No.

     They both say nothing. Stare into the fast-flowing river
     instead.

                         HEDWIG
               I'll miss you of course. But you'll
               come home when you can.
                   (puts her hand to her
                    heart)
               I'll be with you. Just like you'll
               be with me.

                         HEDWIG (CONT'D)
               And after the war, we'll farm. Like
               we said.

     They pick up the sandals and walk back to the steps together.

     EXT. TOP GARDEN, H�SS VILLA - DUSK

     Linna, left dozing, wakes in her deckchair to find the
                                                                        
     swimming party over. The guests have all gone and the staff
     have cleared up around her. Aniela and Marta are up by the
     gazebo bringing the last of the crockery back to the house.

     Linna takes in the peace and quiet of the garden. And a tall
     single arc of black smoke drifting, phantom-like, across the
     late-afternoon sky, high above the wall.
                                                                        
     She rises. Unnerved by it. Then turns and walks back to the

     INT. DINING ROOM WINDOW, H�SS VILLA - EVENING

     The H�ss family are sat at a dinner of turtle soup. Rudolf at
     the head of the table. Hedwig stood behind him. Her arm
     resting on the back of his chair.

                         RUDOLF
               So, I'll be missing Hans's
               birthday. And maybe even our
               anniversary. Depending on how long
               I'll be gone. So, those are some of
               the things that definitely add to
               the struggle. But the life we enjoy
               is very much worth the sacrifice.
                                                                        
     Sullen faces all round. A pregnant pause.

     Murmurs as the family rise from the table and start to clear

     A little time passes. Then she gets up. Goes to the stairs.

                gone.

                          HEDWIG
                What?

      Hedwig skips upstairs. Sophie walks down.

      Hedwig comes back downstairs. Sophie waiting at the bottom.

                          HEDWIG
                Did she leave a note?

                Well, have you looked?

                          SOPHIE
                Well, no. I hadn't thought to.

      Hedwig walks to the lobby.

      on it, tucked into the corner of the guest book.

      She unfolds it. Stands there reading. Then re-folds it.

      Opens the front door. Looks out. Walks back to the dining
      room with the note.

          The F�hrer has approved the
          deportation of Hungary's seven hundred
          thousand Jews for extermination and
          war production where able-bodied. An
          agreement was reached with the new
          Hungarian government to begin the
          action immediately. They are being
          amassed for transportation to
          Auschwitz. Four trains a day, three
          thousand in each, twelve thousand
          daily. Firstly via the Eastern zones,
          one to three. Then via four and five
          in the middle of the country, and
          finally, Budapest. Pressburg and
          Vienna are heavily loaded with
          military transports so Jewish
          transports will pass through Kassa and
          Muszyna instead.
              (refers to his notes)
          Based on estimates provided by
                                                                
          Obersturmbahnf�hrer H�ss, twenty five
          percent will be retained for labour
          after selection. Twenty percent of
          those will be used in Auschwitz sub
          camps, and the other eighty per cent
          will come to your camps in due course.

          The scale is many times larger than
          we've faced before. So get ready.

          Obersturmbahnf�hrer H�ss, I'd like to
          announce the promotion of Colonel
          Maurer to the rank of SS-
          Standartenf�hrer for consistently

      A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE are out there. Rudolf waits his turn.
