                         FADE IN:

          INT. VICTOR'S ROOM - EXTREME CLOSEUP - DAY

          We GLIDE OVER beautiful, shimmering lakes of color.
          PULLING OUT, we find the colors make up the patterns on a
          butterfly's wing, drawn in miraculous detail on a large
          sketch pad.

          VICTOR, a handsome 19-year-old with a gentle, slightly
          dreaming quality, adds tiny finishing touches to the
          sketch. His Victorian-style room is filled with drawings
          and paintings of all sizes, mostly of butterflies. There
          is one prominent painting of Victor with a friendly-
          looking dog.

          The drawing done, Victor lifts a glass bell jar. A
          butterfly escapes, flits around the room and out of the
          open window.

                         CUT TO:
          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

          We FOLLOW the butterfly on its flight around the town.
          The streets are cobblestone. The architecture is cold
          and severe. Hues are muted and grim: the butterfly is
          the only really colorful thing in view. Stiff-looking
          TOWNSPEOPLE walk along -- nodding very formally, and
          without warmth, when they pass each other.
          A church BELL CHIMES the first of four strokes. The TOWN
          CRIER strides into the square and rings his big HAND
          BELL.

                         TOWN CRIER
          Four o'clock and all's well!
          MUSIC begins to grow -- a methodical MARCH. As the
          butterfly floats along a line of shops, we see:

          The GREEN GROCER... arranging fastidious little piles of
          withered onions. The gentle RUSTLE adds a rhythm to the
          song.

          The WATCHMAKER... checking and re-checking the large
          clock that hangs in front of his shop, resetting the
          second hand until it's just so. The clocks TICK like
          metronomes.

          The BAKER... wearily adding another plain brown loaf to
          the pyramid that stands in his window. Each loaf as dry
          and flavorless as the next.

                         (CONTINUED)
          2.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BUTCHER... whose arm rises and falls mechanically,
          filling the air with a constant CHOPPING sound on the
          downbeat.

          WIDOWMUNCH, the seamstress, sits among bolts of cloth,
          all shades of gray. Her SEWING MACHINE CHUGS along in
          rhythm to the MUSIC.

          As the butterfly floats off, we STAY ON the entrance of a
          large stately house. We are back at the home of Victor's
          family, the Van Dorts.

          The front door opens, and out steps WILLIAM VAN DORT.
          He's a slouch-shouldered gentleman who speaks from behind
          his drooping mustache.

                         WILLIAM
          Where is Victor? We might be
          late!
          Victor leans out of an upstairs window. With zero
          enthusiasm ...

                         VICTOR
          Coming, Father.

                         WILLIAM
          Right, right. Very good.

          Victor's mother, NELL VAN DORT, is a plump, pushy
          Victorian matron. She gazes across the town at the
          Everglot Mansion with its two imposing gables.

          She begins to sing, "According to Plan." Nell has the
          voice of an opera diva. William, who talk-sings most of
          his lines, is the gentle voice of reason.

                         NELL/WILLIAM
          A beautiful day!

          They look into each other's eyes, agreeing ...

                         NELL/WILLIAM
          This is a fortunate day,
          For those of recent fortune.
          3.
          Victor arrives beside them. With his gangly legs and
          stiff collars, he always seems miserably uncomfortable.

                         WILLIAM
          Where is Mayhew? We might be
          late!
          On cue, the Van Dort carriage pulls up, announced by the
          HACKING COUGH of MAYHEW, the driver.

                         CUT TO;
          INT. THE CARRIAGE - DAY
          Victor sits across from his parents, who are squeezed
          together uncomfortably as the carriage CLATTERS across
          the cobblestones. MUSIC CONTINUES UNDER...

                         WILLIAM
          Victoria Everglot is quite a
          catch. Isn't she, Victor?

                         VICTOR
          I wouldn't know, Father. I've
          never had a word alone with the
          girl.
          Nell and William share a look.

                         NELL/WILLIAM
          Well, first you say ...

          extremely high hair and an imposing bosom, stands by the

          across the square.

          She sings to her round, importantly-frowning husband,
          FINIS EVERGLOT.

          VICTORIA EVERGLOT. Despite
          a pretty, sweet young girl.
          laced into tight corsets by
          what her mother thinks, she's
          At the moment, she is being
          her elderly maid, Hildegarde.

                         VICTORIA
          Oh, Hildegarde, do loosen it a
          tiny bit.
          Hildegarde hesitates, then quickly loosens the corset.
          She helps Victoria put on a gray, high-collared dress.

                         VICTORIA

                         (CONFIDING)

                           MAUDELINE
          For heaven's sake, Victoria!
          'Like' each other? As if that has

          INT. EVERGLOT ENTRY HALL - DAY
          Finis and Maudeline step down the grand stairway. It's
          cold and imposing, feeling more like a financial
          institution than a home. They are the very image of old
          world high society.

          Victor stands in the sudden silence, unsure of what to
          do. Looking around nervously, his glance falls on a
          nearby room across the hallway. The door is ajar,
          revealing a tantalizing glimpse of a PIANO.

          Victor is irresistibly drawn to it. He sits and touches
          the keys caressingly. On the piano he notices a small
          vase holding a single stem of winter jasmine. He begins
          to PLAY, at first haltingly, then losing himself in the

          out.

                         (BEAT)
          Mother won't allow me near the
          piano. Music is improper for a
          young lady. Too passionate, she
          says.
          Victor nervously rubs his aching knees.

                         VICTOR
          If I may ask, M-Miss Everglot ...

                         VICTORIA
          Perhaps, in view of the
          circumstances, you could call me,
          'Victoria.'

                         VICTOR
          Yes, yes, of course. Well,
          Victoria ...

          Yes, Victor?

                         VICTOR
          Yes. M-Married.
          She sits down beside him on the piano bench.

                         VICTORIA
          Since I was a child, I've dreamt
          of my wedding day. I always hoped
          to find someone I was deeply in
          love with. Someone to spend the
          rest of my life with.

                         (A BEAT)
          Silly, isn't it?

                         VICTOR
          Yes. Silly! Ha!

                         VICTOR
          N-no. Not at all.
          They both LAUGH nervously, moving a tad closer. Victor
          accidentally knocks over the small vase. He grabs the
          scarf from his pocket just as Victoria takes out her
          handkerchief. As they both hastily clean up the spill,
          their hands touch. They look at each other.
          Suddenly in the doorway is PASTOR GALSWELLS, who fixes
          them with a stern, forbidding glare. The parents are
          clustered behind him.
          Victor hastily stuffs the flower in his pocket.

          The group has gathered
          the wedding ceremony.
          William and Nell.
          in the drawing room to rehearse
          Seated are Finis and Maudeline,
          The front of the room has been set up as a makeshift
          altar. An elaborately-carved table holds a pair of
          candles and a chalice.
          Pressure is high. It's the social event of the decade,
          and Maudeline Everglot has left nothing to chance. She's
          like a 19th Century Martha Stewart, obsessively planning
          to the tiniest detail.
          Pastor Galswells presides, holding a book and an
          ornamental holy scepter. Victor trembles in nervous
          agony as Pastor Galswells glares at him.

          Victor lifts his left hand and takes three steps back.

                         VICTOR
          Y-Yes, sir. Certainly.
          Right.
          Right.

          He takes Victoria's elbow, but gets flustered at touching
          her.

                         VICTOR
          Oh, forgive me, I, er ...

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS
          Continue!
          Victoria takes three steps forward. Victor accidentally
          takes four.

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS
          Three steps! Three! Can you not
          count!
          Victor quickly backs up, stepping on Victoria's toe.

          Nell fans herself in distress as Maudeline and Finis look
          on with utter disgust.

                         FASTOR GALSWELLS
          Never mind. Let's just pick it up
          at the candle bit.

                         VICTOR
          The candle bit?

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS

          BARKIS BITTERN, the Everglot's lawyer, enters and hands
          Finis some papers to sign.

                         BARKIS

          Finis quickly signs the papers and hands them back, all
          the while scowling at Victor. Barkis TUT-TUTS in
          sympathetic disapproval. (We sense a private scheming
          thought.)

          Victor tries to light the other candle. He's having a
          hard time. For several long seconds he fiddles with the
          wick as the others watch. Finally, leaning close, he
          gets the candle to light.
          Victor sighs with relief, accidentally blowing the candle
          out.
          From her chair, Nell groans.

          heads toward the dark woods beyond.
          Victor plunges into the woods. Spindly birches give way
          to dark foreboding trees. Victor mutters desperately to
          himself.

          The Corpse Bride moves towards him.
          Victor runs for his life, dodging between the crooked
          tombstones. He CRASHESblindly through the branches of
          the bare, brittle trees that seem to block his escape.
          He stumbles across a small creek as the Corpse Bride
          pursues him.
          As Victor dashes blindly through the trees, the crows fly
          in his path. He reaches the edge of the woods and
          sprints towards the footbridge.

          is oddly silent.
          Suddenly, the crows BURST from the trees, flying straight

          Now, dear, where do you think
          you're going?
          The Bride's eye pops out, and a MAGGOTpeers out of the
          socket. The Maggot looks and sounds like Peter Lorre.

                         MAGGOT
          I don't like him. He's creepy.
          The Corpse Bride pops her eye back in. Maggot rides on
          her ear.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          Oh Victor! I can't wait for you
          to meet everyone.

          How... How do you know my name?

          You think I'd marry a stranger?
          Corne on!
          The Corpse Bride leads Victor away, running.

                         CUT TO:
          INT. TOWNSQUARE (LAND OF THE DEAD) - CONTINUOUSACTION
          The Corpse Bride pulls Victor into
          echo of the town square up above.
          shadowy PASSERS-BY.

          He stops in his tracks.

                         VICTOR
          ... the dead!
          From every direction, CORPSES IN EVERY IMAGINABLESTATE

          Victor recoils in horror. The crowd moves in closer.

          Now he's a fresh one.
          DEAD LADY WITH FLOWERS
          Very fresh.
          A precocious SKELETONBOY curiously pokes Victor with a
          stick.

                         SKELETONBOY
          He's still soft!
          The VARIOUS HORRORSgather round Victor, fascinated.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          He's my husband. He gave me this
          ring!
          The Corpse Bride, beaming, extends her arm to show her
          ring to the gathered crowd.

                         CROWD

                         ("HOW TOUCHING")

          He's still breathing!
          Everyone listens very closely to Victor's panting chest.

                         MOSS MAN
          He is! My word, living flesh! Is
          his heart beating too?

          I'll take it out and have a look!
          Behemoth crams his hand into Victor's mouth.

          Behemoth pulls his hand out.

          As she turns back to Victor, her left eyeball pops out,
          revealing Maggot again, who addresses the townsfolk.

          We saw the whole wedding. It was
          romantic!
          Black Widow emerges behind the Maggot.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          He reminds me of my 3rd, 7th, 24th

                         MAGGOT
          There was one thing missing,
          though. He forgot to kiss the
          bride.
          Gradually, the entire crowd begins to CHANT:

                         CROWD
          Kiss her! Kiss her!
          Corpse Bride giggles, slightly embarrassed.
          Victor can take no more. His spindly legs buckle as he
          FAINTS.

          Victor's eyes slowly open.
          FROM HIS POV
          a huge, blurry SKULL floats in front of him, filling his
          field of vision. As it slowly comes INTO FOCUS, he sees
          it's not a huge skull after all. It's the forms of a
          crowd leaning over him, silhouetted against the light.
          Corpse Bride leans over him.

          Are you alright?

          BACK TO SCENE
          Several skeletons help Victor into a chair as he looks
          around in wide-eyed horror. He sees that he's in ...
          A PUB of some kind. Green flames flicker in the
          fireplace, casting shadows along the crazily tilting
          walls. Rib-like beams rise toward the ceiling.
          Dark figures move through the crowded room and gypsy-like
          music fills the smoky air. Coffin-shaped shelves behind
          the bar are filled with odd and ancient-looking bottles.
          PAUL, THE HEAD WAITER, pokes his head INTO FRAME.
          PAUL THE HEAD WAITER

                         (TO VICTOR)
          Have a drink, dear boy. It'll
          calm your nerves.
          A glass slides toward Victor. The CAMERAPULLS BACK to
          reveal Paul the Head Waiter is in fact, only a head. A
          swarm of BEETLES have emerged from the stump of his neck
          and scurry across the bar, pushing the glass towards
          Victor.
          PAUL THE HEAD WAITER
          (to Corpse Bride)
          Ma cherie, where have you been
          hiding yourself? It's been ages.
          The beetles quickly return, carrying Paul off to serve
          his next customer.
          As the Corpse Bride chats merrily away, Victor scans the
          room. A group of SKELETONS and CORPSES play billiards in
          a far corner. Nearby, a DEAD GENTLEMANsits puffing his
          pipe, as double smoke rings blow from his eye holes.
          WELLINGTON, a tall, ragged skeleton, dressed in the
          remains of a military uniform, has a CANNONBALLHOLE in
          his chest.
          He plays chess with a DEAD DWARF, also clad in the
          tattered remains of a uniform, with a large sword thrust
          through his breastbone. A HANGEDMAN, noose still around  
          his neck, plays darts with a few other CORPSES.  
          Another ROTTING CORPSE sits near the dartboard, reading
          the newspaper, oblivious to the occasional dart landing
          in his head.
          At one end of the room is a small stage, where a band of
          SKELETONS are playing on bizarre instruments made from
          salvaged scraps and bits of bone.

          MRS. PLUM, the cook, is a rotting, blue-skinned old lady
          surrounded by a cloud of flies. She pushes a cart  
          between the tables, serving soup from a large tureen. As  
          she ladles it out, her jawbone drops into the bowl.  
          It's all a bit much for Victor. He takes a gulp of his  
          drink.  
          Victor sees his chance. He grabs the sword in the Dead  
          Dwarf's back, and waves it around, clearing a space in  
          the shocked crowd. The sword still has the Dead Dwarf  
          general attached. The BAND stops playing.  
          Victor's trying to act tough, but his terror is evident  
          to everyone. His hand shakes.  

                         VICTOR

                         BARKIS
          May I have a word with you, sir?

          Yes. Go on.
          Barkis beckons the Town Crier into the room.

                         BARKIS

          27.

                          

                          
          The Town Crier RINGS his BELL, as loud as he ever does in  
          the square. He speaks in the same deafening tones.  
          Everyone else flinches from the volume. OBJECTS RATTLE  
          and fall off shelves.

          The Town Crier leaves the room.
          Everyone is stunned -- especially Victoria.

                         NELL
          Mystery woman? He doesn't even
          know any women!

          has gone.

          assistance -- in any way.  
          Barkis eyes Victoria, the same way a cat looks at a pet  
          parakeet. He then takes his leave.  

                         MAUDELINE
          Oh, the humiliation! Who else

          Look, the Town Crier probably just
          had a slow news day. You know how
          it is. You need something to cry

          Not to mention the financial
          implications.

          A most scandalous embarrassment
          for us all! And with my relatives
          due to arrive. This is most

          I never had a chance to find out.
          Truth is, we hardly know anything
          about each other.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          The thing is, Victor. I know a
          lot about you. I've watched you
          wandering through the woods,
          sketching ...

          Haven't you ever felt like you
          weren't alone, even when you were?
          Or saw something out of the corner
          of your eye and turned and it
          wasn't there?

          The Corpse Bride WHISTLES. Out comes a little skeleton
          dog, wagging its tail, very happy to see Victor.

                         VICTOR
          Scraps! My dog Scraps!
          SCRAPS JUMPS UP and starts LICKING Victor.

          With manic energy, the little dog tears around the bar,
          knocking over glasses before leaping back into Victor's
          lap.
          Hearing the RUCKUS, Mrs. Plum emerges from the kitchen,
          waving her soup ladle.

          Keep him out of my kitchen! Who

          Victoria is alone. She is sewing her quilt -- it now
          covers an entire armchair and is looking slightly more
          unhinged. She seems sadder and lonelier than ever.
          Finally, she stands up and throws on a heavy shawl.
          great effort, she pushes up the window and leans on
          sill, looking out into the rainy night.

          INT. ELDER'S STUDY (LAND OF THE DEAD) - LATER  
          The study is stacked ceiling to floor with crumbling  
          books, scrolls, charts and strange, medieval, scientific
          instruments. Rickety shelves bend under the weight of  
          mysterious jars and boxes. Crows perch in the rafters.  
          The whole place is frosted with bird droppings, and the
          dust of untold centuries. It's Leonardo Da Vinci meets  
          Sanford and Son.
          ELDER GUTKNECHT is an ANCIENT, GNARLED SKELETON, as bent

          Victor and Corpse Bride plead with him as he wanders
          between the stacks, removing something from one pile and

          A twinge of guilt comes across Victor's face.  
          Elder Gutknecht rubs his head in thought, causing a  
          shower of dust to drift off him. Suddenly, inspiration!

          Elder Gutknecht shuffles to a stepladder affixed to his  
          bookshelf.
          Corpse Bride and Victor watch as he hoists himself up
          each step, knocking books off the shelf as he goes.
          At the top of the ladder he struggles to reach for a
          particularly large book.

          Victor retrieves the book and drops it on Elder

          It's just the thing for these

          corporeal travel.

                         VICTOR

          He flips through the pages. Corpse Bride and Victor lean  
          closer, slightly touching one another. They are so  
          intent on the book they don't notice.  

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT  
          It certainly is dusty.  
          What Gutknecht doesn't realize is that most of the dust

          Elder Gutknecht suddenly CRACKSthe egg above their
          heads. Instead of a yolk, a strange, sparkling powder
          falls out.
          The moment it touches Victor and Corpse Bride, they
          instantly collapse.

          Is this a dream?

          Laughing, she glides around the trunk. She dances around

          Victor is transfixed by the vision of her dancing, her

          Victor looks around. To the left, he sees his own house,  
          with one gable. To the right, he sees the Everglots'  
          two-gabled mansion.  
          After a beat of hesitation, he points to the Everglots.

          Perfect!  
          Victor runs toward the house atop the hill.  
          We STAY BEHIND with the Bride as she dances on  
          gravestones. After a few beats, Black Widow and Maggot

          No. Not Victor. He's back in the

          43.

                         SHE'S
          Corpse Bride bursts into tears. Unsure of what to do,
          Victor turns to the Elder for support.

          She's got a point.

                         CORPSE BRIDE

                         ( SOBBING)
          Oh, and I thought ... I thought
          this was all going so well ...

                          

                          

                          

                          
          Her eye plops out with the force of her weeping. Victor  
          picks it up and hands it back to her.

                         VICTOR
          Look, I'm sorry but ... this just
          can't work.

          It's my eye, isn't it?

                         VICTOR
          No ... your eye is fine.
          Really?

          Yes. Listen, under different
          circumstances, well, who knows.
          But, we're just .t.o.o. different. I
          mean, you're dead.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          You should have thought about that
          before you asked me to marry you.

                         VICTOR
          Why can't you understand? It was
          a mistake! I would never marry
          you!

          The words sting. Corpse Bride dejectedly lowers her
          head. She turns and walks out of the Elder's study,
          leaving Victor standing there, feeling like a heel.

                         CUT TO:
          EXT. ALLEY WAY (LAND OF THE DEAD) - LATER
          44.
          Corpse Bride walks down the alley. She reaches into a
          hidden pocket of her gown, and pulls out a dried,
          crumbling wedding bouquet. Petals drift off it.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          Roses for eternal love ... lilies
          for sweetness ... baby's breath ...
          She drops the bouquet on the ground and walks off.
          Victor stands in the shadows, watching the Corpse Bride
          walk away. He follows, but keeps a good distance back.
          Black Widow and Maggot are perched on the bride's
          shoulders. As the bride wipes off a tear, we see that
          the moisture floats away like feather down.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Forget him. He's not worth the
          tears, darling.

                         MAGGOT
          But what tears they are! Strong
          and wispy!

                         CORPSE BRIDE

                         (IGNORING)
          I can't compete with that woman.
          She has everything he wants.
          Including a pulse.

                         BLACK WIDOW
          Nonsense!
          MUSIC RISES for a song, "Break My Heart."

                         BLACK WIDOW
          All she has is life,
          You have everything after!
          All she has is blood and hair,
          You have glorious laughter!
          As Black Widow and Maggot get into it, they start
          swinging around the bride, flying on spider web lines.

          Famine, death and pestilence,
          Haven't troubled you in years,
          The best part of being dead,
          Is burying your fears.

          No matter what he thinks.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          He thinks I'm a monster.

          A little inspired, Corpse Bride takes on a verse:

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          Cut me with a knife,
          I feel nothing.

          Burn me with a flame,
          I'll keep smiling just the same.

                         BLACKWIDOW
          As well you should!

          Break my heart.

          scandal!

                         HILDEGARDE
          Miss Victoria, dear, let Hilde fix
          you a nice cuppa tea. Come sit in
          your chair ...
          I can't sit!

          you're shakin' like a leaf. Let
          Hilde fetch you a blanket.

          Fetch her a straightjacket. She's
          completely mad!

          Annoyed, Maudeline turns on her heel and exits.
          Hildegarde leads Victoria to a chair and drapes a blanket
          across her shoulders.

                         VICTORIA
          A corpse in a wedding gown, with
          my ring on her finger. It was
          awful!

                         HILDEGARDE
          Truly awful, Miss Victoria. A
          corpse in a wedding gown! I've
          heard tell of such things. Don't
          worry, dearie, we'll save Master
          Van Dort from the clutches of
          darkness.

          her.

          The rain is falling hard.

          Miss Everglot! What are you doing  
          here! You should be at home
          prostrate with grief!

                         HILDEGARDE  
          We sought the advice of a man of  
          the cloth.  

                         VICTORIA
          Pastor Galswells, I have to ask
          you something.

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS
          This is most irregular!

                         VICTORIA
          Please, I beg of you! Tell me,
          can the living marry the dead?

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS
          What on earth are you speaking
          about?

                         VICTORIA
          Please, Pastor Galswells! It's
          Victor! He needs our help! He's
          married to a corpse! He has a
          Corpse Bride!
          Pastor Galswells looks at her piercingly.

          She squirms desperately to escape as Pastor Galswells
          holds her firmly.

          Victoria struggles wildly. She's muddy and disheveled,
          looking more and more, in fact, crazy.

                         PASTOR GALSWELLS
          She is speaking in tongues! Of
          unholy alliances! Her mind has

          streets through the POURING RAIN. Mayhew sits, wet and
          miserable, his hacking cough reverberating.
          Seated within, Nell and William continue their search for
          Victor. William peers out the window on one side as Nell
          looks out the other, scanning the vicinity with a pair of
          opera glasses. From outside, in the driver's seat, comes
          the sound of Mayhew's RASPING COUGH.

          Did you hear the latest gossip?
          Our son, married to a corpse,
          she's saying.

          outside for the wedding feast. It's quiet and still, a
          "closing time" vibe.
          The place is empty except for a skeleton who sweeps the
          floor, and Mrs. Plum, who pushes a cart of dirty dishes
          into the kitchen. Up on the stage, Corpse Bride sits,
          PLINKING sadly on the old piano.

          I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied to
          you about wanting to see my
          parents. Truth is, I'm happier
          not to see them.
          Corpse Bride doesn't respond. The Maggot pops out of her
          ear.

          Oh, save it for the living girls,
          Vic. I think you've said quiet
          enough already.
          The Black Widow emerges. They perch on her shoulders,
          one on either side.

                         VICTOR

          I've had dozens of husbands, and
          none of them as heartless as you.
          You should be ashamed.

          You're married now and there's
          nothing that anyone can do about

          Don't bother. You can't force him
          to like me.

                         VICTOR
          53.

                          
          But I do like you. Truly. It's  
          just this whole evening hasn't  
          gone quite, well, according to  
          plan.  
          After a beat, Victor sits down on the bench next to her.
          He starts playing along. Corpse Bride looks up at him,  
          surprised, but keeps playing, as he improvises.  
          It's nothing fancy, just simple fun like "chopsticks."
          Something Victor would never have played in the company
          of others before.
          The music picks up as they play. It's almost like a  
          "Dueling Banjos" thing: Corpse Bride plays a riff, and  
          Victor echoes it back with an unexpected spin.  
          They're starting to truly enjoy themselves.  
          Corpse Bride takes a solo, her skeletal hand breaking
          free from her wrist and running on its fingers down the
          length of the keyboard. It dances there, doing a little  
          "soft shoe" melody before the Corpse Bride, laughing,
          picks up her hand and snaps it back into place.

                         CORPSE BRIDE

                         (GIGGLING)

          I like your enthusiasm.
          An awkward beat. Victor and Corpse Bride look at each
          other.  
          Suddenly a LOUD CRASH is heard from the kitchen. Scraps  
          comes running out through the door with Mrs. Plum in  
          pursuit.  
          MRS. PLUM
          Who let that filthy beast in my
          kitchen!
          We FOLLOWScraps and Mrs. Plum out into the village
          square.

                          

                          

                          

                         \
          EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - SAME TIME
          The place is bustling as the Dead prepare for the
          upcoming party.
          54.
          Bonejangles and the Skeletones, who have been warming up,

                          

                          
          break into SONG to inspire the hard-working crowd.  
          This leads to a "spontaneous" musical number in which
          skeletons stagger back and forth arranging heavy tables
          as steaming platters are laid out with tightly
          choreographed precision, like a Busby Berkeley musical.
          Mrs. Plum leads the singing, (think "Everybody Eats When  
          They Come to My House" by Cab Calloway) as the trays of
          odd, gnarled "food" hit the table. The whole village  
          gets into the act, arranging dead flowers and hanging
          decorations.
          Paul the Head Waiter scurries between people's feet,
          darting from place to place, supervising the activities.
          As the MUSIC continues, Corpse Bride, feeling her old
          cheerful self again, gazes at the party preparations
          swirling around her. Her eyes settle on Victor, in his
          filthy, tattered jacket.
          She studies him carefully, shaking her head.

                          

                          
          Black Widow emerges from Corpse Bride's ear and WHISTLES.
          Suddenly, dozens of fellow spiders descend from above and  
          land on Victor. Victor closes his eyes in horror.  
          Without missing a beat, the spiders swarm over him. They  
          repair his tattered suit in Land of the Dead style. The
          plain, austere fabric is now interwoven with glistening  
          spider webs, and glows with a sinister elegance.  
          Victor opens his eyes and looks down in astonishment.
          Corpse Bride beams as party preparation, and the MUSIC,
          reach fever pitch.
          A group of skeletons stagger under the weight of a
          grotesque, towering wedding cake, decorated with tangled
          roots and spider webs.

                          
          It tilts and sways precariously from side to side. It's  
          so massive that skeletons dance on the first three
          layers. Mrs. Plum, on top of the cake, puts the  
          finishing touches on as the MUSIC ENDS, giving way to
          excited chatter and applause.
          The excitement is interrupted by the clamor of --  
          A BELL RINGING.

          into an arrogant sneer, as Hildegarde hovers around him,
          pins in her mouth, making adjustments to the high-
          collared wedding suit.
          Barkis' sneer quickly transforms into an obsequious smile
          as Finis enters the room.  

                         BARKIS
          I must thank you again, sir, for
          the unexpected honor of ...

          Cut the small talk. You're an
          Everglot now, and Everglots do not
          mince words. I expect this
          wedding to come off without a
          hitch. Do I make myself clear?

                         BARKIS
          Absolutely, sir. Without a hitch.
          Crystal clear, sir.

                         FINIS
          Excellent.

                         BARKIS

                         (PIOUSLY)
          I shall not disappoint you, sir.

                         (POINTEDLY)
          Most certainly not in remembering
          my vows.
          He jumps as Hildegarde has, apparently by accident, poked
          him with a pin. He glares at her. She looks back at
          him, the soul of innocence. Barkis returns his gaze to
          the mirror, and smiles approvingly at his own reflection.

                         TWILIGHT
          58.
          The party is about to begin. Corpse Bride is putting on
          the finishing touches, when Elder Gutknecht approaches
          her.

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          Very good indeed. I've always
          thought people worried too much
          about the ceremony and not enough
          about the celebration.

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          Well, it was a very quick
          ceremony.
          She tucks a dead flower in his lapel.

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          As it should be. In my day, we
          didn't bother with cups and
          candles. Rubbish, all of it. How
          does anyone keep it straight when
          they say their vows?

                         CORPSE BRIDE

                         (PLAYFULLY)
          Lucky for me, I didn't have to. I
          was rather silent!
          Elder Gutknecht stops. Dust drifts off him.

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          Excuse me?

                         CORPSE BRIDE
          (a little more

                         HESITANTLY)
          I was rather silent?

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          You didn't say your vows?
          No ... ?

                         CORPSE BRIDE

                         (FRIGHTENED NOW)

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          But, my child, you must both say
          the vows for the marriage to be

          Barkis Bittern stands, holding up his wine glass for a  
          toast. Normally, he'd have to wait for the room to grow  
          silent, but it's already library-quiet.  

                         BARKIS  
          As many of you know, it was a  
          quick courtship for Victoria and  
          I. But love is like that --  
          spontaneous and unexpected.  
          Unbridled! Serendipity may have  
          brought us together, but no force  
          on Earth could ever tear us apart.

          Sorry to bust in, but we need some  
          tables. We've got a celebration  
          of our own.  
          Skeletons and ghouls lift several tables, carrying them  
          right out the door, along with the plates and silver.  
          Amid the commotion, Victoria and Hildegarde run from the  
          room.  
          Maudeline strives gamely to maintain her composure, until
          the Hanged Man lurches up to her and rips his head  
          through the painted portrait.  

                         HANGEDMAN

          this very grand house, and all
          your lovely 'family heirlooms'?  
          Noticing Victoria's absence, Barkis goes looking for her.

          EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT  
          It's been transformed beyond recognition into a brightly-  
          colored, pulsating party zone. The Green Grocer's racks  
          of lettuce heads are now skulls, while the skeleton  
          children run with bolts of fabric from the Widow Munch's  
          seamstress shop.  
          To the consternation of the watchmaker, Wellington is re-  
          setting all the CLOCKS to RING at once. Down the street,  
          Paul the Head Waiter leads a crew of ghouls through the  
          baker's shop, spraying frosting everywhere.  
          Amid this tumult, we FIND Corpse Bride and Victor. He
          looks around, smiling.

                         VICTOR
          I like this place better already.
          Realizing the undead mean them no harm, The Living are
          gradually warming up to the situation. Nell is swept
          into the revelry, caught up dancing with the Dead Dwarf
          General.
          Pulling mother away, Victor introduces them to Corpse
          Bride.

                         VICTOR

          Up near the statue -- and the crashed carriage -- Elder  
          Gutknecht stands at a makeshift altar. Corpse Bride and  
          Victor join him.  
          Elder Gutknecht flips through his book.

          Corpse Bride slips off her ring, and hands it to Victor.  

                         VICTOR  
          With this hand I will lift your  
          sorrows. Your cup will never  
          empty, for I will be your wine.  
          With this candle, I will light  
          your way in darkness. With this  
          ring, I ask you to be mine.  
          He slides it back on her finger. She smiles, but there's  
          a trace of guilt there.  

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          Now, you.

          empty, for I will be your wine ...
          As Corpse Bride speaks, she sees Victoria off to the
          side, watching with quiet horror.

                         ELDER GUTKNECHT
          Go on, my dear.

          With this ...  
          Victor looks puzzled, waiting for her to continue.

                         VICTOR
          What's wrong?
          The Corpse Bride looks up at Victor. She smiles as a
          tear rolls down her tattered cheek.  

                          

                         CORPSE BRIDE  
          Ihi.Ji is wrong .  
          She takes off the ring and hands it to him. In her eyes  
          we see a sad tenderness for the fleeting love that almost
          was, and an acceptance that it never could be.

                         CORPSE BRIDE  
          I love you, Victor, but you're not  
          mine. My dreams were taken from  
          me. Now I've stolen them from  
          someone else.  
          Only now does Victor follow her gaze across to...

          I heard you were too.  
          She holds up her hand, revealing the ornate wedding ring.  
          Corpse Bride reacts with alarmed confusion.

          He lands a few blows before Barkis sloughs him off.

          Black Widow CALLS AFTER Barkis ...

                         BLACK WIDOW
          We'll be seeing you.
                          

                          

                          
          Amid all the chaos, Corpse Bride simply walks away. We  
          settle on Victor and Victoria, watching her leave.  

                         VICTORIA
          I feel terrible for her. To lose
          so much.

                         VICTOR
          I think she's finally free.
          EXT. VILLAGE FOOTBRIDGE - DAWN

                         CUT TO:
          Corpse Bride crosses the bridge alone. Soon she is
          obscured by the fog flowing around her.

                          

                          
          EXT. FOREST - DAWN  
          As Corpse Bride moves through the trees, her veil catches  
          against the bark. She twists back on herself, slowly  
          spinning, caught up in the gossamer threads. Before  
          long, the veil has wrapped around her like a cocoon.  
          She's completely hidden inside. We see the cocoon
          vibrate. A metamorphosis is clearly occurring.
          Suddenly, the cocoon breaks open.

          71.

                         CONTINUED:
          One hundred brilliant butterflies emerge, rising in the
          wind.  

                          
          Much like the start of the movie, we FOLLOWthem as they  
          fly. Their journey takes them back to...  
          EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE- DAY  
          ... where a wedding is taking place.
          Victoria slides a ring over Victor's finger. As they  
          lean in for their kiss, they both notice the butterflies  
          overhead.  
          They watch them for a moment, somehow knowing.  
          FADE OUT.
