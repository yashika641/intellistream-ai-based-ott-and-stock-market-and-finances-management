5   INT. FREUD'S STUDY (MORNING)                                  5

    A DOG'S face, puzzled. The Chou, "JOFI," stares quizzically
    across the room. Behind Jofi, the small statue of ISIS and
    the others are on a long bookshelf. All are statues and
    carvings of various sizes. All are Gods.

    INSERT TITLE: LONDON, SEPTEMBER 3, 1939

    At the end of the bookshelf, a divan is covered by an
    Oriental carpet. A woman leaning over the divan blocks our
    view of the person stretched out on it.

    We look up at the face of ANNA FREUD, 43, psychoanalyst,
    bright but tightly wound, concentrating intensely.

    The SOUND of raspy, pained exhale. Her back to us, Anna helps
    the unidentifiable man sit up on the couch, returning his
    feet to the floor. She adjusts the bow tie below his white,
    bearded chin.

    Anna takes a step back, revealing her FATHER, DR. SIGMUND
    FREUD, 83, not at all well.
                                                               2.


                        FREUD
                  (Latin)
              Medicus animarum.

    Anna takes his hands, helping him to his feet.

                        ANNA
                  (smiling)
              "The Doctor lives."

    END CREDITS.


6   EXT. THE KILNS, C.S. LEWIS' HOME (OXFORD, DAY)                6

    The small, brick country home of C.S. Lewis known as the
    Kilns, rose bushes climbing up the front of the house.


7   INT. LEWIS' BEDROOM                                            7

    C.S. LEWIS, a youthful spirit, despite the toll of the Great
    War. He's an Oxford Don, but one you'd still share a pint
    with. He puts on his vest and looks out his window at the
    vast, green countryside.

    MRS. JANIE MOORE, a striking woman, nearly twenty years
    older, attempts to help Lewis with his tie. He moves away,
    adjusting it himself.

                        JANIE MOORE
              Call him! Just tell him you can't
              come! London will be bedlam.

                        LEWIS
              No one tells a man like him
              anything.

                        JANIE MOORE
              But today? It's dangerous! Stay
              here, with me. We'll wait for
              news.

                        LEWIS
              Bad news will find you anywhere.

    Janie hugs him.

                        JANIE MOORE
              Don't leave, Jack.

    Lewis gently pulls away, taking her hands.
                                                             3.


                        LEWIS
              We survived one war, Janie. We will
              again.


8   EXT. KILNS � MOMENTS LATER                                    8

    Lewis, wearing his topcoat and a small cardboard box on a
    strap around his shoulder, comes down his front path. He
    notices an elderly woman, wearing vintage clothing up ahead
    with her dog, a chow. Suddenly the door behind him opens and
    Janie comes running after him, pulling on her coat.

                        JANIE MOORE
              I'm coming with you.

                        LEWIS
              No reason to go. I'll be fine on my
              own.

    She's heard this too many times.

                        JANIE MOORE
              The "reason" is that I'd like to.

                        LEWIS
              Stay here, where you're safe.
              Really, Janie. I'm perfectly fine.

    Janie is hurt.

                        JANIE MOORE
              You always are, aren't you?
              Anywhere but here.

    Lewis watches her return to the house, shutting the door.
    When he turns back, the old woman and his dog are no longer
    there. He looks slightly confused and continues on.


9   INT. OXFORD TRAIN STATION  (MINUTES LATER)                     9

    Lewis steps out to a platform. There's a nervous energy,
    people on edge. Nearly everyone carries the same cardboard
    box. Lewis stands and watches alongside another older woman
    as soldiers herd children onto a crowded train.

                        WOMAN
              It's horrid... Having to send
              their children off for fear of
              bombs...

    Lewis agrees, watches as a YOUNG MOTHER strings an I.D. Card
    around her six year old's neck with his destination: Norwich.
                                                               4.


     A Soldier signals to the Conductor and the train pulls out.
     Children, uncomprehending, frightened, wave "goodbye" to
     their families. Some parents force smiles, others cry.

     The Norwich mother begins running alongside the moving train,
     touches the window meeting her son's hand. The train gains
     speed, HER HUSBAND catches her. She stops, sobbing in his
     arms.

     Orchestra music playing from the station's loudspeakers
     abruptly stops.

                         BBC ANNOUNCER
               Regular programming is interrupted
               to bring you this broadcast. The
               German Ministry continues to assert
               Chancellor Hitler's claim that the
               Polish state has ignored offers of
               peaceful settlement. There is still
               no official response to the Prime
               Minister's ultimatum that all
               troops be immediately withdrawn.

     Lewis and others stare silently at the speaker, faces filled
     with concern.


10   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                             10

     Freud stands before his radio, listening keenly to the same
     broadcast, Anna at his side.

                         BBC ANNOUNCER (CONT.)
               We have just received confirmation
               that Slovakian troops have joined
               the Russian invasion. We return to
               the BBC Orchestra until we bring
               you more news.

     The orchestra resumes playing. Freud turns the music off.
     Anna sees his tie askew, and tries to adjust it. He moves
     away, irritable.

                          ANNA
               I'm not going in, I'll call the
               Institute.

                         FREUD
               Your students expect you.

     He goes to the mirror and adjusts his tie himself.
                                                         5.


                    ANNA
          They'll be thrilled to have a free
          period.

                    FREUD
          They need routine, today of all
          days. I can take care of myself.
          Dr. Schur will be here with the
          morphine within the hour.
              (checks his watch)
          I think - or was it?

He checks his watch again. A brief moment of confusion -
hardly noticeable - but Anna is aware of her Father's
disorientation - no longer 'Professorial absent mindedness '-
but some other disorder.

A slight pause: Freud looks around a moment, then remembers
something. He takes a small square of paper from his pocket,
looks at something written on it.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Oh yes. There is also an Oxford
          Don coming. Today. He needs an
          education on punctuality.

                    ANNA
              (surprised)
          Who's that?

                    FREUD
          What?

                    ANNA
          The oxford Don?   Who is it?

He glances back at the square of paper.

                    FREUD
          A Professor Lewis...

                    ANNA
          Lewis?

Freud grows irritated - 'is my daughter going deaf?' Elderly
anxiety and impatience.

                    FREUD
          Professor C.S. Lewis. From Oxford.

                    ANNA
          The Christian Apologist?
                                                          6.


                     FREUD
          Ja.   Who has much to apologize for.

Anna goes to help him fix the stupid tie. Again, flicking his
hand, her father pulls away to adjust the tie himself.

                    ANNA
          I'd like to bring Dorothy back with
          me. On a day like this, no one
          should be alone.

                    FREUD
              (irritated, petulant)
          We won't be alone!

He walks to his desk and picks up papers, opens a drawer,
shuts it - meaningless activity - anything to escape fights,
arguments, opposition.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          And I'm certain Dorothy would be
          more comfortable in her own home.

Searches for something in his pockets, on his desk.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Maybe next week.

                    ANNA
          Then the next, and the next. When,
          Father? How many times do I have to
          ask you? It's past time you
          accept...

She stops herself. Freud, suddenly exhausted, almost tearful,
sits down on his famous couch. Clamps his eyes shut.

A depression. BRIEF SILENCE. Sounds of the house. Clock
ticking. Car horn. Distant piano practice. The crushing
melancholy of Life.

Sudden unendurable fear and depression. The morphine and the
pain itself are taking their toll, causing mental lapses.

Two still figures of utter loneliness. Anna standing quietly
in the patriarchal center of her life. The broken patriarch
on the sofa of recovery, now in need of counseling and help.

Freud pats the couch for Anna to sit beside him.

                    FREUD
              (quietly)
          You remember Professor Einstein's
          visit?
                                                              7.


                            ANNA
               Of course.

     Her father opens his eyes and looks ahead into the growing
     shadows of the room.

                         FREUD
               We talked about the true indication
               of insanity: Doing the same thing
               over and over and expecting a
               different result.

                         ANNA
               So the surest indication of
               "sanity" would be the ability to
               change your mind.

     Exhausted by this constant battling and her father's
     monumental narcissism, she quietly leaves the room.


11   EXT. TUBE STATION, LONDON  (DAY)                              11

     Lewis emerges from the tube station in London, where he
     observes soldiers placing sand bags outside, barrage balloons
     filling the sky.

     It's hectic, families entering the station carrying
     suitcases, evacuating the city. Lewis checks his watch and
     quickens his pace against the herd.


12   EXT. MARESFIELD COURT  (LATER)                                12

     Lewis turns up the street past another family securing
     suitcases to the roof of their car. Just ahead, the door to
     20 Maresfield Garden opens, and Anna emerges wearing an
     overcoat and hat, walking quickly up the street.

     LEWIS and ANNA hurry past each other.

     After a few steps Anna looks back, realizing the man might be
     Lewis. She turns back and he is checking the house number.
     She watches dubiously as he starts towards the door. She
     hesitates, call out -

                         ANNA
               Professor Lewis?

                            LEWIS
                      (turns back)
               Yes?
                                                                8.


                         ANNA
               Anna Freud... I just wanted to say
               hello, and well...
                   (forces a smile)
               Good luck to you.

     She turns away awkwardly and quickly goes.   Lewis looks
     puzzled. "Good luck?"


13   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                          13

     Freud writes at his desk, crowded with dozens of statuettes.

     SOUND of BARKING, then the DOORBELL. He looks over at the
     clock on a curio filled shelf: 11:25. He rises and walks
     toward his study door.

                          FREUD
               Jofi! You hear someone coming?
               Smart dog.


14   INT. HALLWAY                                                 14

     Freud emerges from his study, spots Jofi yapping at the door.

                          FREUD
               Jofi!   Come here, Jofi! Run to
               Papa!

     Jofi stares at him, not moving.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               Or just sit there.


15   EXT. FRONT DOOR                                              15

     The door opens. Lewis, already anxious, stares into Freud's
     stone face.

                         LEWIS
               Dr. Freud! I'm-

                         FREUD
               Professor Lewis, I had given you up
               for lost.

     Lewis takes off his coat, expecting Freud to take it.
     Instead, Freud turns and walks toward his study.

     Jofi, coming closer, watches Lewis follow Freud. Lewis smiles
     at the dog, something vaguely familiar, but Jofi bolts off.
                                                         9.


                    LEWIS
          What kind of dog is he?

Freud stops at the door of his study.

                    FREUD
          A chow. Highly intelligent.   He is
          my assistant.

                    LEWIS
              (smiling)
          Really?

Freud does not return the smile.

                    FREUD
          Ja. Really.

FREUD'S unblinking `seriousness' is a mask, Teutonic
humorlessness.

                     FREUD (CONT'D)
          He stays with me through all my
          sessions. Jofi is my emotional
          barometer.

                    LEWIS
          How so?

                    FREUD
          If a patient is calm, he   stretches
          out at my feet. But if a   patient is
          agitated, Jofi stands at   my side
          and never takes his eyes   off him.

Lewis tries to lighten things up, but his attempts are inane.

                    LEWIS
          How interesting.

Lewis looks to Jofi, who stares back from down the corridor.

                    LEWIS (CONT'D)
          What should I make of him running
          away at the sight of me?

Another dead pan stare from Freud.

                    FREUD
          He, too, is a fanatic for
          punctuality.

Freud checks his fob watch, enters his study. Lewis hangs his
coat on a rack along with the cardboard box he's carried.
                                                             10.


16   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                           16

     Freud goes and sits behind his desk. LEWIS looks around the
     room. FREUD watches him as if studying a new form of life.

                         FREUD
               Fortunately for her, my wife is
               traveling with her cousin so I have
               sent out our housekeeper to stock
               up on canned goods, canned food.
               We must always expect the worst.
               Agreed?

                         LEWIS
               Of course. I'm terribly sorry to be
               so late. All the trains were
               filled with children being
               evacuated to the country. Have you
               been listening to the radio?

                         FREUD
               I always listen to the radio. I
               find it convenient to be warned
               before getting bombed... I have
               other engagements so our visit must
               be brief.

                         LEWIS
               Perhaps we should postpone?

                         FREUD
               Until when, Professor? Until when?
               Do you count on your tomorrows?
               Because I do not.

                            LEWIS
               Of course.

     Freud watches his visitor closely.

                         FREUD
               You, British people, you say: `of
               course' numerous times in
               conversation. 'Of course'. Why is
               that? What does it mean?

                         LEWIS
               I don't know. Habit.   I suppose.

                         FREUD
               Interesting.

     FREUD smiles a little as he quietly studies LEWIS. A moment
     of peace, tranquility and deeper understanding. Stillness.
                                                                11.


     Two opposite personalities from different backgrounds,
     different national traits and tragic histories. A clock
     chimes quietly from some distant room.

     LEWIS crosses to the window. He looks out at the garden.

                         LEWIS
               You have a lovely home.

                         FREUD
               Yes. My daughter, Anna, has done
               her best to replicate our home in
               Vienna.

     He watches Lewis over at the window.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               You, too, are not a native of this
               country. Am I correct?

                         LEWIS
                   (looking out)
               I was born in Belfast, but I've
               been here since when I was sent to
               boarding school at thirteen.

                         FREUD
               Your Irish will always win out. We
               all try so valiantly to leave our
               past. Our childhood. But they will
               never leave us. Nor the sorrows of
               the world...
                   (a beat)
               This will never be my home.

     FREUD contemplates the shadows in the room. The slow ticking
     of the clock.

     Suddenly, Freud gets up from behind his desk. The old man
     goes towards the French window. He passes by Lewis as if he
     wasn't there, reaches the double door and throws it open to
     the garden -

     WHICH IS SUDDENLY NOT THE GARDEN.


17   EXT. RATHAUS (TOWN HALL) GARDENS, VIENNA � 1930              17

     TO GREAT APPLAUSE two officials, seen from Freud's POV, open
     the double doors to the Vienna garden where a crowd is
     gathered.
                                                             12.


18   EXT.   FREUD'S GARDEN, ENGLAND - SAME                        18

     Freud steps into his own gardens followed by a curious Lewis.


19   EXT.   GARDENS, VIENNA - SAME                                19

     Freud's POV, as he passes colleagues and friends. His wife,
     MARTHA, matronly, claps proudly.

     DR. ERNEST JONES, 50, British, neurologist and psychoanalyst,
     applauds from the end of his aisle. Dr. Jones looks across
     the aisle, noticing Anna. She senses his gaze, meets his
     eyes, and then quickly turns back to-

     DOROTHY BURLINGHAM, 48, seated beside Anna. She is an
     American heiress to the Tiffany fortune. Pretty, with short
     cropped hair, there is an intimacy apparent between her and
     Anna, not lost on Freud.

                          MAYOR (O.S.)
                Es ist mir eine gro�e Ehre...

     Freud joins the MAYOR on the platform stage in front of the
     garden's large fountain flanked by Luminaries.

                          MAYOR (CONT'D)
                Herrn Dr. Sigmund Freud heuer die
                Goethemedaille zu verleihen. (It is
                my honor to present this year's
                Goethe Prize to Dr Sigmund Freud.)

     The Mayor hangs the ribbon holding the GOETHE MEDAL around
     Freud's neck. To Freud's side is a huge AUSTRIAN FLAG.

                          MAYOR (CONT'D)
                Herzlichen Gl�ckwunsch, Doktor!
                (Congratulations Doctor!)

     MOMENTS LATER

     Freud makes the rounds, when he is pulled aside by Dr. Jones.

                          DR. ERNEST JONES
                They've never given the Goethe
                Prize to a Psychoanalyst before.


20   EXT. GARDEN, ENGLAND - SAME                                  20

     Lewis watches Freud, concerned.
                                                              13.


                          FREUD
                They've never had Psychoanalysts in
                Germany before.

     LEWIS, confused, notices Freud's sudden disorientation. He
     takes the doctor's arm.

                          LEWIS
                Dr. Freud? Are you?

                          FREUD
                What!

     FREUD is startled. He finds human contact unpleasant. As if
     waking from a sleep, still disoriented, staring into space as
     if he had been watching those people, those memories of Anna,
     all the while.

     The OS voices - his memory of the two women - Anna and
     Dorothy laughing so many years before. Echoes and
     Distortions.


21   EXT. GARDEN, VIENNA - SAME                                   21

     Freud's POV. Quick Flash back to Anna, carrying a bouquet.
     Dorothy watches them, from behind. Freud sees Dorothy, then
     stares at his daughter.

                          FREUD
                Here is my prize...


22   EXT.   GARDEN, ENGLAND - SAME                                22

                          FREUD CONT.
                ....with whom I am always happy.

     In front of him is the azalea bush. Then suddenly free of
     hallucination. Back in the present moment. His favorite
     flower, the azalea! He notices LEWIS, but manages to cover
     his brief lapse.

                          FREUD
                My favorite flower, azalea.

     Freud reaches into his pocket for a small penknife/flower
     clippers, and plucks two azaleas from the bush. Much to
     LEWIS's surprise, the Doctor presents an azalea to him.
     Almost a gesture of friendship and respect.

     He threads the stem into the lapel button hole of LEWIS'
     jacket, then attempts to fix the other flower into his own.
                                                           14.


LEWIS helps him. It could symbolize Freud's only bond of
friendship and trust.

Suddenly, he is conscious of this `too close' moment of
`intimacy,' and the formidable and rigid mask, sternness
returns his face.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Since we have so little time we
          should come to the reason I wrote
          you.

He begins to trudge back to the house. Lewis, unsure,
follows.

                    LEWIS
          Of course. My book, "Pilgrim's
          Regress."

                    FREUD
          It's a parody, yes? A parody on
          "Pilgrim's Progress", yes?

                      LEWIS
          Yes.

                    FREUD
          A clever idea if anyone still reads
          Milton.

                    LEWIS
          I understand that what I've written
          offends you.

                    FREUD
          Offends me? Why?

                    LEWIS
          My satirizing you with the
          "Sigmund" character. Bombastic.
          Vain. Ignorant. Perhaps I was over
          zealous. I'm sorry if you took it
          as a personal attack. But I can't
          apologize for challenging your
          world view when it completely
          negates my own.

                      FREUD
          Which is?

Lewis stops. FREUD continues his painful walk back towards
the sanctuary of his office.
                                                             15.


                         LEWIS
               That there is a God. That a man
               doesn't have to be an imbecile to
               believe that. And those of us who
               do aren't suffering from an
               "obsessional neurosis."

                         FREUD
                   (pause)
               Oh, I've never read your book.

     Lewis, taken aback, deflated - he just stares at the doctor,
     who disappears through the double doors and into his Office.


23   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                           23

     Freud fusses at the tea table as Lewis enters inside.

                         FREUD
               Tea?

                         LEWIS
                   (Still stung)
               No, thank you.

                         FREUD
               Good. It must be cold by now.

     Surreptitiously, Freud puts a pill in his mouth. He coughs,
     clears his throat, then coughs again. Lewis gestures, but
     Freud waves him off, pouring a glass of water.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               Professor Lewis, if you disagree so
               strongly with my views, why did you
               come here to see me?

                         LEWIS
               Not all of them. When I was a
               student we devoured your every book
               to discover our latent perversions.
               And I was shocked when I read you
               declared Pilgrim's Progress a work
               of "genius." Seriously? A clash
               between God and Satan?

                         FREUD
               I didn't say whose side I was on.

                          LEWIS
               You've insisted all your life that
               the very concept of God is
               ludicrous.
                                                              16.


                          FREUD
                Yes.

                          LEWIS
                So why do you care what I think if
                you're satisfied in your disbelief?
                Why am I here?

     A beat - for the first time, the shadow of a smile crosses
     over Freud's face.

                          FREUD
                For one reason. I want to learn why
                a man of your supreme intellect
                could suddenly abandon truth and
                embrace an insidious lie.

                          LEWIS
                What if it isn't a lie? Have you
                ever considered how terrifying it
                would be to realize you're wrong?

                          FREUD
                Far less terrifying than it would
                be for you. You said earlier that
                you challenge my world view, my
                belief in disbelief.

                          LEWIS
                I do.

     PAUSE then a broad welcoming smile beams onto Dr. Freud's
     face, and he opens his arms of welcome. Lewis stares at him,
     realizing the true reason for his visit.

     Just then the phone rings. Freud walks over and picks it up.


24   INT. STUDY OF THE LONDON PSYCHOANALYTIC SOCIETY � SAME       24

     Anna is on the phone. Classical music from the BBC Orchestra
     is heard from a radio on the Secretary's desk.

                          ANNA
                    (on phone)
                Have you frightened off your
                Professor yet?


25   INT.   FREUD'S STUDY - CONT.                                 25

     Freud steals a glance at Lewis.
                                                             17.


                         FREUD
                   (on phone)
               Soon, I'm sure... No, stay and
               lecture, I'm perfectly well. Ja.


26   INT. HALLWAY OF THE PSYCHOANALYTIC SOCIETY                  26

     Anna hangs up. Behind her in the hallway, the Society's
     President, DR. BERBRIDGE, listens to an angry male STUDENT.

                         STUDENT
               His daughter? I'm not paying
               tuition to hear her opinions.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               Miss Freud is an expert on Freudian
               and Kleinian Analysis, and a valued
               member of our Psychoanalytic
               Society.

                         STUDENT
               Which I'm sure she achieved through
               her own merit. She's not even a
               Doctor. Why should I waste my time
               with her lecture?

     Anna emerges from the office.

                         ANNA
               You shouldn't, Mr. Hensel. You're
               absolutely right, you wouldn't
               learn a thing. I'm sure you already
               know all there is about adolescent
               narcissism.

     She walks toward the lecture hall. Dr. Berbridge follows.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               There was no need for that. I was
               handling the situation.

                         ANNA
               I'm sorry. I missed that.

     Dorothy Burlingham, fellow faculty member, spots them and
     catches up, listening.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               I've been looking at enrollment for
               your proposed "Child Analysis"
               course. Frankly, I doubt we'll get
               enough interest to justify it.
                                                        18.


                    DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          Well I've spoken to several faculty
          members who are concerned with the
          scheduling of Miss Freud's class.

                     DR. BERBRIDGE
          How so?

                    DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          We're asking you to consider moving
          it to evening so we all can sit in.

                    DR. BERBRIDGE
              (uncomfortable)
          I'll take it into account. Ladies.

He quickly departs. Anna looks to Dorothy and mouths "Thank
You". Dorothy smiles.

                    DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          Did you speak to your father about
          tonight?

Anna's face hardens, continues walking.

                    ANNA
          You do know we're about to be at
          war?

                    DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          That's nothing new for him. Never
          met anyone more bellicose.

                    ANNA
          He used to make you laugh. The
          most wonderful sense of humor you
          said...

                     DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          Did he?   I hardly remember.

                    ANNA
          You just need to be reasonable.

                    DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
          I'm in England, aren't I? With
          you. Reasonable would be that we
          at least shared the same roof. The
          children don't even understand. I
          didn't know your father had such
          delicate sensibilities.
                                                             19.


                         ANNA
                   (gives up)
               I have a lecture.

     Dorothy stops, frustrated.    But Anna keeps walking.

                         ANNA (CONT'D)
               Find me later.

                         DOROTHY BURLINGHAM
                   (to herself)
               I always do...


27   INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS                            27

     Anna enters the hall filled with students, all male. She
     takes her place behind the podium on a platform, consults her
     notes and looks up at the men.

                         ANNA
               Good morning, Gentleman.

                         MEN
                   (together)
               GOOD MORNING.

                         ANNA
               Shall we begin?


28   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                           28

     Freud settles back in his chair.

                         FREUD
               Please, sit.

     Lewis turns to see Freud's FAMOUS COUCH and freezes.

                            FREUD (CONT'D)
               Not there.

     He indicates a chair before his desk.

                            FREUD (CONT'D)
               Here.

                          LEWIS
                   (relieved)
               Of course.
                                                             20.


                         FREUD
               My colleague, Eric Larson, knows a
               colleague of yours. A Mr. Tolkien?

                         LEWIS
               Yes, we're close friends.

                         FREUD
               What exactly are "Inklings"?

     Lewis smiles.

                         LEWIS
               It's what we call our literary
               group at Oxford. We discuss each
               other's work.

                         FREUD
               These are fantasies?

                         LEWIS
               Often, yes.

                         FREUD
               I have spent much of my life
               examining Fantasies. In the time I
               have left I am determined to
               understand what I can of reality.
               Your parents, did they inject you
               with this fairy tale faith?

                         LEWIS
               No... My faith ended with my
               childhood. I buried it along with
               my mother. She died when I was
               quite young.

     Freud studies Lewis, as if a patient.


29   INT. LEWIS HOME - PARLOR - FLASHBACK CONT.                29

     Young Lewis and Warren stand beside their FATHER, accepting
     condolences.

                         LEWIS V.O)
               My Father was consumed with grief,
               unable to process it, or to take
               ours into account.

     Young Lewis looks past them to see his Mother in her coffin.
     Her spirit is drained from her body, hardly recognizable, a
     frightening face of death.
                                                               21.


     Lewis turns to Warren, alarmed when he gives out a sob.
     Their Father looks at them both. Gentlemen don't cry. Lewis
     takes Warren's hand and they return to their formal stance.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                His only solution was to send us
                off to England for boarding school.


30   EXT.   FERRY - CONTINUOUS                                    30

     We see Lewis along with Warren, grief stricken, terrified, on
     the deck of a ferry departing for England.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                It's perhaps my life's greatest
                trauma, more than the war.

     They look back at their father and Ireland, receding in the
     distance. Their father waves a pitiful goodbye, guilt-
     ridden.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                It was all sea and islands now, the
                great continent had sunk like
                Atlantis.


31   INT. BOARDING SCHOOL - FLASHBACK - DAWN                      31

     A cold winter's morning when the boys wake in their bunks.
     Warren gives Jack his birthday gift.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                But then on my next birthday, my
                brother, Warren, gave me the most
                wonderful present I'd ever been
                given - A New World.

     C.U. of a miniature, a porcelain DEER and DOE standing in a
     constructed forest. The deer has a giant ball of dust stuck
     to his head. A BOY'S HAND reaches down and picks up the
     figure.

     Young Lewis removes one deer from the "forest" his brother
     created for him:

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                A toy forest he created in a
                biscuit box.

     Young Lewis pulls off a dust ball and returns the deer.
                                                                22.


     We roam from the deer through the "forest", filled with
     trees, boulders and a painted blue stream on the box's floor,
     all in proportion.

     In the center of the forest is a one dimensional BEATRIX
     POTTER illustration glued to stand upright.

                         LEWIS (V.O., CONT.)
               Moss, twigs, tiny stones and
               flowers.

     Suddenly, the toy forest comes to life, transforming into a
     magical realm, the twilight colors all heavily saturated.

     Peter Rabbit is now alive, hopping through the wooded
     landscape towards a fantastic sunset. It's idyllic. Endless.

                         LEWIS (V.O., CONT) (CONT'D)
               I thought it was the most beautiful
               thing I'd ever seen. I still do.
               The moment I saw it, it created a
               yearning I never felt before.


32   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                              32

     Lewis' delight is contagious.

                         LEWIS
               I called that feeling "Joy." I
               still do.

                         FREUD
               And this "joy" you equate with an
               inherent desire for a Creator?

                         LEWIS
               Yes.

                         FREUD
               You were led to God by a biscuit
               tin.

     Lewis laughs. Freud almost smiles.

                         FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
               Our deepest cravings are never
               satisfied, or even identified. In
               German, we call it "Sehnsucht." A
               longing. All my years I have felt
               this.
                                                                23.


33   INT. FOREST - FREUD'S FLASHBACK                                 33

     Freud is six. He walks through the dark woods, holding his
     father JACOB'S hand. Enchanted, he listens to the sounds
     around him.

     Only this is a very different forest than the one Lewis
     imagined. It is a Gothic realm, eerie and haunted,
     unforgiving.

                         FREUD (V.O.)
               A strong desire to walk in the
               woods with my Father.

     C.U. Freud pulls his hand free - his father tries to stop
     him, but he runs ahead, deep into the woods.

                         JACOB FREUD
                   (terrified)
               SIGMUND!!

     But Freud doesn't even look back.   He vanishes into the
     forest's darkness.

     Freud runs as fast as he can, weaving through the trees, but
     suddenly slows to a stop, looking ahead.

     Sound of a brook: Freud looks down to find he is standing in
     the middle of a painted brook.

                         FREUD (V.O.)
               I was never frightened that my
               father had vanished. I was alone
               in the woods where I was most
               drawn.

     He looks up again, and sees that the forest ahead is not
     real, the trees are dark and twisted, the landscape
     threatening. Freud stares, curious. He steps towards the
     Gothic forest of his subconscious.

                         LEWIS (V.O.)
               That my father would not have been
               absent...


34   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                              34

     Freud is pulled back into reality, seizes Lewis' admission.

                         FREUD
               Thus, your search for a Divine
               Father Figure.
                                                                24.


                          LEWIS
                If anything, it made me determined
                to avoid father figures.

                          FREUD
                A normal father-son dynamic.
                Childlike adoration turns to a
                realization of his weaknesses, then
                the desire to displace him.

                          LEWIS
                And your relationship with your own
                father?

                          FREUD
                At best, he was a bitter
                disappointment.


35   EXT.   VIENNA CITY STREET 1862 � FREUD'S FLASHBACK � DAY     35

     Freud, six years old, holds his father, JACOB'S, hand as they
     walk down the pavement. Ahead, four well-dressed YOUNG MEN
     are talking and laughing, blocking the sidewalk.

     One BLONDE YOUNG MAN turns to see Jacob, wearing a black
     fedora, coming toward them. Jacob tightens his grip on his
     son, trying to give the young men berth. They just clear
     them when a hand grabs Jacob's fedora.

     Jacob turns. The BLONDE MAN holds the hat gingerly as if it
     is tarnished. Freud looks from his father to the men.

                          JACOB FREUD
                Bitte� (Please)

     The BLONDE MAN turns to the others as if impressed by Jacob's
     politeness.

                           BLONDE YOUNG MAN
                "Bitte"?

     He moves as if to hand Jacob his hat back� and at the last
     moment tosses it over his shoulder into the muddy street.

     The young men laugh as the hat sits in a puddle. Freud is
     horrified. The blonde man steps up to his father.

                          BLONDE YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
                Verschwinde vom Trottoir, Du
                Jude!(Get Off the sidewalk, Jew!)

     He pushes Jacob, who loses balance, falling backward into the
     muddy street alongside his hat.
                                                               25.


     Freud watches his father, covered in mud, rise with his hat,
     shaking mud off it.

                         BLONDE YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
               Schweine lieben ihren Schlamm!
               (Pigs love their mud!)

     Shamed, Freud's Father meets his son's eyes as others laugh.

                         FREUD (V.O.)
               I don't know which of them I
               detested more.


36   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                              36

     Freud allows this feeling to linger into his look at Lewis.

                         LEWIS
               The same anger you feel toward a
               God that does nothing. The wish
               that God doesn't exist can be just
               as powerful as the belief He does.

     ALL OF THE SUDDEN AN AIR RAID SIREN SCREECHES--

     Stunned for a moment, both men are frozen.

                            FREUD
               Gas masks!

     Freud hurriedly takes from his desk the same cardboard box
     Lewis arrived with and pulls out a gas mask.


37   EXT. MARESFIELD COURT � MOMENTS LATER                        37

     Freud and Lewis, holding their gas masks, look out to see
     neighbors all rushing in the same direction. Mothers carry
     infants or pull their elderly parents behind them.

                         LEWIS
               WHERE'S THE SHELTER?

     Freud points to a CHURCH STEEPLE a few blocks away.

                         FREUD
               THE CHURCH BASEMENT!

     Lewis and Freud start down the street. Freud, breathing
     heavily, can't move faster. He has to stop, gasping.

                            LEWIS
               HURRY!
                                                                26.


                          FREUD
                I CAN'T! GO!

                          LEWIS
                I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

                          FREUD
                DON'T BE A FOOL!

                          LEWIS
                TAKE MY ARM!


38   EXT.   ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH � MARESFIELD COURT                38

     Freud and Lewis join a crush of frightened people pushing
     through the church's doors. Two priests try to keep order.

                          FATHER BRENNAN
                FORM A LINE, PEOPLE! WE ARE NOT
                ANIMALS AND THIS IS NO ARK! EASY,
                EASY! EVERYONE WILL GET IN!

                          FREUD
                    (lifts eyebrow to Lewis)
                Would that your St. Peter be so
                generous?

     Lewis just stares ahead, not amused.


39   INT.   CHURCH                                                   39

     Once inside, the crowd is herded down stairs leading to the
     basement, an evocative image. Everyone's eyes are in front,
     except for Freud's. He scans the church's marble carvings and
     painted dome. Lewis just looks ahead with dread.


40   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT                                         40

     The sound of babies crying. People packed together. Freud
     follows Lewis down the narrow stairs into the candlelit
     darkness when Lewis' breathing becomes labored.

                          FREUD
                Are you alright?

     He begins to have a panic attack, reliving some past trauma.
     All the noise in the room grows louder, more heightened.

     Lewis puts his face to the wall, his hands grabbing the
     stones on either side of him.
                                                             27.


     People push past him, but not Freud who edges through them to
     Lewis' side. He recognizes what is happening immediately.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               You were in the war?

                         LEWIS
                   (barely audible)
               The Somme....

                         FREUD
                   (confident, firmly)
               Breathe. Breathe, slowly.

     Lewis, does as he is told.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               That's right. Focus on me.

     Freud guides him off the wall.


41   EXT. CHURCH � CONTINUOUS                                     41

     Upstairs Father Brennan looks out to the street where a 1938
     VAUXHALL SEDAN passes. An air raid warden leans out his
     window, shouting through his bullhorn.

                         AIR RAID WARDEN
               THERE IS NO ATTACK!! THE SIREN IS A
               FALSE ALARM!


42   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - SAME                                  42

     Suddenly the air raid siren STOPS.

                         FATHER BRENNAN'S VOICE
               False Alarm! We are all clear!

     Lewis hears this. He takes a deep breath of relief. Freud
     takes his arm to guide him back up the stairs. Lewis looks at
     him grateful, but embarrassed.


43   INT. CHURCH � LATER                                          43

     As the crowd filters out, Lewis rests. He watches Freud
     exploring the church, inspecting every carving and statue.

                         LEWIS
               Dare I say you look at home?
                                                             28.


                         FREUD
               Art appreciation. The same as I
               would viewing cave paintings.

     He walks past marble statues Lewis identifies.

                         LEWIS
               Michael the Archangel, The Virgin
               Mother, St. Paul, St. Paul's horse.

     Freud stops before a statue of a young woman wearing a scarf
     over her hair, a book in her hand with a shamrock on the
     cover and a short sword tucked under her arm.

                         LEWIS (CONT'D)
               Not a clue.

     Father Brennan steps up behind as Freud continues to stare.

                         FATHER BRENNAN
               St. Brigid. She's the Patron Saint
               of Nuns.

                         FREUD
               This is not St. Brigid.

                         FATHER
               Who is it, then?

                         FREUD
               St. Dymphna.

     Freud continues down the aisle. Lewis, surprised, looks to an
     even more surprised Father Brennan.


44   EXT. MARESFIELD COURT - CONTINUOUS                        44

     Lewis and Freud slowly walk back to Freud's home, the church
     behind them in the distance. The Air Raid Truck comes down
     the street, still broadcasting.

                         AIR RAID WARDEN
               RETURN TO YOUR HOMES! FALSE ALARM!
               APOLOGIES! THERE ARE NO BOMBS!

     As the truck passes them Lewis begins to laugh. He attempts
     to contain it, but it bursts out.

                         FREUD
               What? I don't understand.

     Lewis tries to stop his laughter.
                                                         29.


                    LEWIS
          "APOLOGIES there are no bombs?!"
          What would he do if there were?
          Send sympathy cards?

Both Freud and Lewis are laughing now.   People around them
are baffled � they must be crazy men.

                    FREUD
              (catching his breath)
          This is how we forget.

                       LEWIS
          Excuse me?

                    FREUD
          The defense of humor. Our brains
          cannot hold on to horror. We must
          move on. A random thought to break
          its hold. I wrote a book on humor.

Lewis nods with no enthusiasm.

                    LEWIS
          Yes. I read it... We English take
          our humor very seriously.

They turn a corner. More people return to their homes and
work. Children, wearing gas masks, play tag among them.

                    FREUD
          English humor is still a foreign
          language to me.

                    LEWIS
          I agree.
              (off his look)
          Your examples were somewhat
          clinical. Jokes pinned down like
          dead frogs, then dissected.

                    FREUD
              (stops, insulted)
          Are you saying my methodology was
          flawed?

                    LEWIS
          No. Your jokes were. They aren't
          funny.

Another air raid warden passes as they approach Freud's home.
                                                                30.


                         FREUD
               Not funny? I used classic
               illustrations!

                         LEWIS
               Let me think..ah, here. "Two Jews
               before a bath house.."

                         FREUD
               Yes! The first Jew asks, "Have you
               taken a bath?" And the second
               says.. he says..

     Freud laughs, tries to complete the joke again, but can't.

                         LEWIS
               "Why? Is one missing?"

     This makes Freud laugh harder. He looks at Lewis, who is
     stone faced.

                         FREUD
               Do I have to explain it's hilarity?

                         LEWIS
               No-

                         FREUD
                   (insistent)
               "Take a bath", as in bathing, or
               "Take a bath", meaning stealing
               one. An example of memesis! Two
               conflicting realities.

                         LEWIS
               As funny as a hanging.

     Freud, stunned by this, just follows after Lewis.

     SOUND OF PHONE RINGING �


45   INT. FREUD'S STUDY � MOMENTS LATER                           45

     Freud is on the phone. Lewis is by the radio, turned low.

                         FREUD
               Yes, Max.?... How late?
                   (looks at his watch)
               Quite severe. Can it be sooner?
               Can you come later? Max?... MAX!

     Freud slams the phone down.
                                                                31.


                         LEWIS
               Can I be of any help?

     Irritated, Freud gestures to the radio. Lewis turns it up.

                         BBC ANNOUNCER
               ...with the destruction of the
               entire Polish Air force by the
               Luftwaffe. Military and civilian
               casualties are already estimated to
               be over 20,000, a number certain to
               rise as German bombing continues.
               King George will address the
               Commonwealth from Buckingham Palace
               within the hour. Until then, we
               return to our musical program.

     The BBC Orchestra begins to play. Freud shuts the music off.

                         LEWIS
                   (shaken)
               Twenty thousand killed in two days.
               It's nearly impossible to take in.

     Freud, in pain, seething from his doctor's delay, paces.

                         FREUD
               More of God's "Mysterious Ways. I
               wonder what would your "Inklings"
               say to that?

                         LEWIS
               A hundred things.    Simultaneously.


46   INT. THE EAGLE AND CHILD PUB, OXFORD � FLASHBACK             46

     Inside a warm crowded pub we find a cluster of loud,
     outspoken men, arguing good-naturedly. These are THE
     INKLINGS. LEWIS sits beside his older brother, WARREN.

                         WARREN
               Utter nonsense, Barfield! There is
               no such thing.

                         BARFIELD
               Of course there is! It's a physical
               ailment! I feel it every time I
               step inside!

                         LEWIS
               "Library Terrors"?
                                                              32.


                         BARFIELD
               Doesn't anyone else here get it?
               That feeling when you walk into a
               library and it grips you- terror at
               the number of books you haven't
               read yet.

     Warren dismisses him, others show their agreement.

                         WARREN
               Moving on! Who's reading?

     J.R. TOLKIEN pulls a thick pile of pages from his bag.

                         J.R. TOLKIEN
               I have a new chapter!

     This doesn't meet with much enthusiasm.

                         BARFIELD
               Tolkein, then.

                         TOLKIEN
               Chapter Forty Eight.

     Sighs are heard. Lewis holds up his hand, rising.

                         LEWIS
               I move we order another round
               first.

                            WARREN
               A miracle!     My brother is buying!

     Enthusiasm from the men.


47   INT. PUB - LATER                                           47

     ALL drink and listen to TOLKIEN read, rapt attention.

                         TOLKIEN
               "It is not despair, for despair is
               only for those who see the ending."
                   (to himself)
               No, wait.

     He scratches out part of the sentence and makes a correction.

                         TOLKIEN (CONT.) (CONT'D)
               "Despair is for those who see the
               end beyond all doubt.'
                                                            33.


                         WARREN
               I'm confused. That was Frodo?

                         TOLKIEN
               No, no! That's Gandalf.

                         BARFIELD
               So Gandalf's your Christ figure?

                         TOLKIEN
               You could say the same about Frodo.
               There are really three �

                            WARREN
               A Trinity.

                         TOLKIEN
               Actually, they're more like Demi-
               Gods.

                         LEWIS
               Have you thought about adding any
               specified breed of ogres to Middle
               Earth?

                         TOLKIEN
               What kind, Jack?

                         LEWIS
               The ones who eat Hobbits.

     Even Tolkien has to laugh.


48   EXT. OXFORD - ADDISON'S WALK � SUNSET                    48

     A path lined with trees leading into the deep woods. Tolkien
     and Lewis appear, walking past a tree. Both wear ties and
     black academic robes. Tolkien smokes his perpetual pipe.

                         LEWIS
               Have you been indoctrinating my
               brother again?

                          TOLKIEN
               Me?   Never.

                         LEWIS
               Warren's insisting I go with him to
               Falconer Tavern to try their Tyskie
               Pale Lager this Sunday.

                            TOLKIEN
               So?
                                                                34.


                         LEWIS
               Coincidentally, it's just across
               the street from his new Church.

                          TOLKIEN
               I'm innocent. But let me know about
               the lager.

                         LEWIS
               What about Weldon?   I saw him last
               evening.

                         TOLKIEN
               "Sour Tom"?


49   INT. LEWIS' CHAMBER � FLASHBACK � THE PREVIOUS EVENING       49

     WELDON, a heavyset man, sits before a fire as Lewis
     approaches with their next round. Weldon reaches for his
     glass of scotch.

                         WELDON
                   (reluctantly)
               I've been reading the Bible.
               Reluctantly.

     Lewis takes the drink back, laughing.

                         LEWIS
               I felt no earthquake.

                          WELDON
               And I'm nearly amused.
                   (takes his drink back)
               Lewis, I've been examining the
               historical authenticity of the New
               Testament.

     Weldon stops himself, embarrassed.

                         LEWIS
               "Authenticity?"

                         WELDON
               It seems that its events... From
               first study, of course...
                   (plunges in)
               I think it all really happened.

     Off Lewis' bafflement.
                                                             35.


50   EXT. ADDISON'S WALK                                          50

     Tolkien stops to listen.

                         LEWIS
               He was so flustered he left before
               my shock wore off. Weldon's always
               been an atheist.

                         TOLKIEN
               A rabid one.

                         LEWIS
               How could he, of anyone, take the
               Bible literally? It's a fictional
               anthology of myths and legends.

     Tolkien stops. Lewis follows his view:

     A DEER and her DOE standing in the forest, look back at them.

                         TOLKIEN (CONT.)
                   (hushed)
               When you read myths about Gods
               coming to earth and sacrificing
               themselves, their stories move you.
               As long as you read them anywhere
               but the Bible.

                           LEWIS
               Nonsense!

     The DEER bolt back into the forest, disappearing.

     Embarrassed, Lewis looks to Tolkien, who shakes his head and
     continues walking.

                         TOLKIEN
               Jack, pagan myths were born through
               God expressing Himself. But the
               myth of Christ is God expressing
               Himself through Himself. What
               makes it more than myth is that
               Christ actually walked the earth
               among us. His dying transformed
               myth into truth and transforms the
               lives of all who believe in Him.

                         LEWIS
               You're a Scholar, Clive! Don't you
               have an obligation to seek the
               truth?
                                                             36.


                          TOLKIEN
                Of course! The same as you. Do your
                research, examine the evidence.

     Lewis scowls, but it's a fair point.


51   EXT. OXFORD - FLASHBACK CONT.                             51

     Lewis walks through Oxford to the doors of Bodleian Library.


52   INT.   RARE BOOK ROOM - FLASHBACK CONT.                   52

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                Which I did.

     A DOCENT, wearing white gloves, carefully takes a book from
     its locked cabinet.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                No book was safe. From current
                scholarship back 1600 years.
                Starting with the Codex Sinaiticus.
                The oldest surviving manuscript
                copy of the New Testament.

     The DOCENT finds Lewis and puts it gently on the table before
     him. Lewis sits, impressed. With gloved hands he opens the
     book to the first page, written in Greek.

                          LEWIS
                The Book of Matthew. 400 A.D.


53   INT. LEWIS' BEDROOM - LATE EVENING                        53

     The door that connects Janie's bedroom to Lewis' opens. Janie
     stands in the doorway, wearing her nightgown, loosely drawn.
     She frowns to see Lewis at his desk, reading.

     She goes over to him, standing behind him. Her POV of Lewis,
     reading, a pen in his hand and a pad filled with notes.

                          JANIE MOORE
                Jack?

                          JACK
                Mmm?

     Lewis doesn't look up. She puts her hands on his shoulders,
     whispers into his ear.
                                                          37.


                          JANIE MOORE
               Bedtime.

                         JACK
                   (not listening)
               Good night.

                         JANIE MOORE
               What can you be reading that's more
               fascinating than me?

     She leans down to see. Disbelief.

                         JANIE MOORE (CONT'D)
               The Bible?!

                         JACK
               Have you read it?

                         JANIE MOORE
               It's been quoted at me.

                         JACK
               It's often a weapon, isn't it?

     She looks more closely.

                         JANIE MOORE
               The Creation. Adam and Eve? You
               don't really believe all that, do
               you? That they were real?

                         LEWIS
               I believe it doesn't really matter
               what I think.

     Janie stares at Lewis, who still hasn't looked up.


54   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                        54

     Freud waits, curious, for his explanation.

                         LEWIS
               Critically, as a literary
               historian, I'm perfectly convinced
               that whatever the Gospels are, they
               aren't myths. They aren't artistic
               enough. They're clumsy. Most of
               the life of Jesus is left totally
               unknown to us, and writer's
               building a legend wouldn't allow
               that to happen.
                                                                38.


     Amused, Freud leans forward over his desk.

                         FREUD
               You are convinced of Christ's
               existence because of bad
               storytelling?

                          LEWIS
               Christ's existence isn't in doubt,
               only who he was. The man was
               chronicled by his contemporaries
               and historians. Even H.G. Wells,
               whose skepticism rivaled my own,
               admitted "Here was a man. This part
               of the tale could not have been
               invented.'

                         FREUD
               That Christ was a man I don't
               argue. The same as Mohammed or
               Buddha.

                         LEWIS
               But only Christ made the appalling
               claim to be the Messiah. He also
               claimed the power to forgive sins;
               how absurd is that?

                         FREUD
               I'm convinced. Christ was a
               lunatic.

     Freud rises from his seat and goes over to the bathroom.


55   INT. FREUD'S BATHROOM /FREUD'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER         55

     Freud stands before an open medicine cabinet, takes out a
     small bottle. He hesitates, picks up a tiny onyx pill box.

                         FREUD (CONT.)
                   (loudly, to be heard)
               Why should I take Christ's claim to
               be God more seriously than the
               dozen patients I've treated who
               claim to be Christ?

     Freud opens the tiny black pill box: a single dark red pill.


56   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                              56

     Frustrated, Lewis looks back at the door, to Freud.
                                                               39.


                          LEWIS
                And did you find a single person
                whose concept of reality was
                otherwise sound?


57   INT. BATHROOM - SAME                                         57

     Freud, agitated, stands at the sink, considering.

                            FREUD
                      (reluctantly)
                No.

     Freud stares at himself in the mirror, he looks old.   He can
     see his own physical pain reflected in his face.


58   INT.   FREUD'S STUDY                                            58

     Freud goes back to sit behind his desk, opens the top drawer
     and puts the small box inside. Closes the drawer.

                          LEWIS
                So if Christ was not a lunatic it
                forced me to consider the only
                choice I was left with.


59   EXT. LONDON STREETS - LEWIS FLASHBACK � DAY                  59

     The roar of an engine accelerating.   Lewis rides on the back
     of his brother WARREN's motorcycle.

     He looks at the crowds of people they swiftly pass and all of
     a sudden his expression changes.

     He seems to see something that surprises him. Then
     everything slows down for him as the "Crowd" becomes
     individual portraits of unique lives.

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                On my way to the London Zoo, my
                decision came as naturally as I
                decided to wear trousers that
                morning.

     An OLD MAN, hunched over, walks slowly down the street. An
     excited gang of TEENS runs past him on either side.

     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN tries to conceal her tears with her
     handkerchief, walking faster.

     A POLICEMAN discreetly turns to watch an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.
                                                              40.


     A VIOLINIST on the park corner is lost in his music,
     oblivious that no one has stopped to listen.

     SOUND: THE SQUEAL OF BRAKES, A CAR HORN HONKS-- WARREN'S
     SMALL MOTORCYCLE BUMPS UP THE CURB ONTO A SIDEWALK AS HE
     SWERVES TO AVOID AN ONCOMING CAR, A LARGE, WIDE AUSTIN.

     HIS CYCLE MOTOR CHOKES, STALLS AND STOPS. WARREN IS SHAKEN,
     LEWIS IS PERFECTLY COMPOSED.

     Lewis turns to his brother.

                            LEWIS
               Warren?

                         WARREN
               Don't blame me! The Bugger was in
               the middle of the road! And
               speeding!

     He sees his brother is lost in some other thought.

                         WARREN (CONT'D)
               You alright?

                         LEWIS
               I believe Jesus Christ is the Son
               of God.

     Warren, stares at Lewis, expecting a punch line.   When there
     isn't one, he starts up his motorcycle.

                            WARREN
               Well then.

     They drive off.


60   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                            60

     Freud rolls his eyes, unimpressed.

                         LEWIS
               It was that simple.

                         FREUD
               Things are simple only when you
               choose not to examine them.

                         LEWIS
               Some things can be accepted. I'm
               here before you, am I not? That's
               how plainly obvious this was.
                                                                  41.


                         FREUD
               But you're asking for the same to
               be true of others.

     The accusation hangs in the air.    Lewis doesn't deny it.


61   INT. THE KILNS � KITCHEN - FLASHBACK                           61

     Lewis, Janie and Warren finish dinner the same night as
     Lewis' declaration in Warren's sidecar.

                         JANIE MOORE
               You're not going to be preaching
               from some Hyde Park soapbox, I
               hope.

                         LEWIS
               Just an observation.

                         JANIE MOORE
               Isn't your conversion suspiciously
               un-dramatic? St. Paul was at least
               blinded by lightning and knocked
               off his horse, wasn't he?

                         WARREN
               Luckily, St. Paul didn't have
               Covent Garden traffic behind him.

     Lewis gets up to clear his plate.

                         JANIE MOORE
               So, then, what does this minor
               miracle mean?

                         WARREN
               A trip to the pub after church on
               Sunday!

                         LEWIS
                   (smiles at his brother)
               Yes, quite... Well it's been a day,
               I think I'm going to retire.

                         JANIE MOORE
               To your good book!

                         LEWIS
               Good night.

     He walks out leaving Janie fuming.
                                                              42.


62   EXT.   BACK YARD - NIGHT                                    62

     Lewis steps outside, taking in the night, lighting a
     cigarette. Janie comes out after him, interrupting.

                          JANIE MOORE
                You don't get off that easy.   What
                does it mean for us?

                          LEWIS
                I don't understand.

                          JANIE MOORE
                This is all terribly convenient for
                you. You want me on my knees
                lighting candles? Embroidering the
                Ten Commandments on our pillows?

     Lewis meets her eyes. Things are now different.

                          LEWIS
                No need, Janie...   We both know
                them.

     The words sit in the air. He stares at her, can see the
     sadness filling her eyes. It's a betrayal. She is shaken.

                          JANIE MOORE
                You coward.

     She turns away and rushes back inside. Lewis is left
     standing there, reeling. The sound of a phone ringing.

                          FREUD (O.S.)
                Yes, right away. Thank you, Anna.


63   INT. FREUD'S STUDY - CONT.                                  63

     Freud hangs up the phone, turns on the radio.

                          FREUD
                Chamberlain!

                          CHAMBERLAIN (O.S.)
                Up to the very last it would have
                been possible to have arranged a
                peaceful and honorable settlement
                between Germany and Poland, but
                Hitler would not have it.

     Lewis grows increasingly aggravated.
                                                              43.


                          CHAMBERLAIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                His actions show convincingly that
                there's no chance of expecting this
                man will ever give up his practice
                of using force to gain his will.


64   INT. INSTITUTE - FACULTY LOUNGE - SAME                      64

     Anna listens along with staff and students, who crowd the
     room to hear the news.

                          CHAMBERLAIN (V.O. CONT.)
                He can only be stopped by force.
                Now may God bless you all. May He
                defend the right.

     Dorothy enters and finds Anna. She goes over to her, can see
     her concern. Anna whispers in her ear.

                          ANNA
                The talks broke down.

                          DOROTHY
                God help us.

     As Chamberlain concludes, Anna tightly grips Dorothy's hand.

                          CHAMBERLAIN   (V.O., CONT.)
                It is the evil things   that we shall
                be fighting against �   brute force,
                bad faith, injustice,   oppression
                and persecution.

     Dorothy glances at Anna. Chamberlain could be talking about
     the two of them.

                          CHAMBERLAIN (V.O.)
                And against them I am certain that
                the right will prevail.

     The broadcast ends.   Anna glances at Dorothy, they walk out.


65   INT.   HALLWAY                                                 65

     Chaos in the hallway as STUDENTS argue about England's entry
     into war. ANNA and DOROTHY move through them.

                          DOROTHY
                Are you alright?
                                                             44.


                         ANNA
               I wanted to believe we'd be safe
               when we left Vienna.

                         DOROTHY
               We don't know how Hitler will
               respond.

                          ANNA
               I do. I've seen the kind of men he
               created. They won't stop until they
               get everything they want.
                   (beat)
               They didn't with me.

     Dorothy knows what she's referring to, doesn't argue.


66   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                           66

     Freud listens, grim.    Lewis is shaken.

                         BBC ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               You have been listening to a
               broadcast from 10 Downing Street-

     Freud turns his radio off in disgust, walking away from it,
     stopping at the doors to the garden.

                         FREUD
               So it begins.

     Freud is distressed, but Lewis appears even more so.

                            LEWIS
               Again.

                         FREUD
               The First War taught me nothing. I
               underestimated Hitler.

                         LEWIS
               Everyone did. It's hard to believe
               such a hideous man exists.

                         FREUD
               I've found little that is good
               about human beings. In my
               experience, mankind is earth's
               litter. Whether they publicly
               subscribe to this or that ethical
               doctrine. Something better not to
               say aloud. Or even think.
                                                             45.


                         LEWIS
               An optimist, are you?

     Freud just grunts, not amused.


67   INT. FREUD'S VIENNA APARTMENT � FLASH BACK - DAY          67

     A social gathering is in progress. Anna, Dorothy, and her
     Mother, Martha, move through their guests. In the corner, Dr.
     Ernest Jones is in urgent conversation with Freud.

                         FREUD
               It's much too early, Ernest. We
               can't make hasty decisions.

                         DR. ERNEST JONES
               Hasty?! The Anschluss is a fact!
               We should leave while we can! It's
               not just you in danger anymore,
               it's your family! The bigger your
               reputation, the bigger target you
               are for them. Leave the country
               now. Tomorrow! Let me help you
               before its too late.

                         FREUD
               Where would I go?

                         DR. ERNEST JONES
               Anywhere! I know you hate America-

                          FREUD
               I don't "hate" America. I simply
               regret it.

                         DR. ERNEST JONES
               Then come with me to London!

     The front doorbell rings, and Martha Freud excuses goes to
     answer it. Across the room, Dorothy and Anna watch the men.

                         ANNA
               He'll never leave.

                         DOROTHY
               And you'll never leave him.

                         ANNA
               What about you?

                         DOROTHY
               It's time, I'm afraid, for the
               children.

                                                           46.

                    DOROTHY (CONT'D)
          Though I have to admit I'm in
          agreement with your father. New
          York does little for me either.

                    ANNA
          What I wouldn't give to see you on
          Madison Avenue in proper society.
          The Tiffany scion.
              (off Dorothy unamused)
          Sorry... Would you come to London?

                    DOROTHY
          Do you really have to ask?

As Martha nears the door it flies open, wood splintering from
the kick it's been given.

A half dozen German Brownshirts enter, weapons in hand.
Guests panic. A man tries to slip out a door to the butler's
pantry but it is blocked by a soldier.

                    COMMANDER
          SIGMUND FREUD!

Anna turns, and Dorothy grabs her arm, holding her back.

                    DOROTHY
          Don't.

Across the room, Freud hesitantly steps forward. Dr. Jones
approaches the Commander.

                    DR. ERNEST JONES
          Sir, I am Dr. Ernest Jones, from
          Great Britain. The Chancellor is a
          personal friend-

The Commander pushes him aside, spotting Freud.

                    COMMANDER
          Him.

Freud is grabbed by two Brownshirts, who take his arms.

                    ANNA
          No!

                    DOROTHY
          Anna-

Anna breaks free from Dorothy, and rushes over to the
Commander, standing before him.
                                                         47.


                    ANNA
          My Father is a very sick man. Take
          me instead. I know everything he
          does. I will be far more helpful.

The Commander looks Anna over, considering. If she's not good
for information, she might be good for something else.

                    COMMANDER
          Let him go.

To Freud's dismay they release him, grabbing Anna instead.

                    FREUD
          No, Anna, don't be ridiculous!

The Commander scans the guests, enjoying their fear.

                    COMMANDER
          Ladies. Gentlemen. Until we meet
          again.

He turns to exit.

                    FREUD
          Wait!

Freud pushes past guests to Anna, hugging her to him.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Mein kind. Why are you doing this?

                    ANNA
          When they take you, it will be too
          late.

Arms wrapped around her, he whispers in her ear.

                    FREUD
          If there is no hope.

He slips into her hand the tiny black pill case we saw
earlier. Anna closes her hand around it.

She glances back at Dorothy, and turns and walks out the
front door flanked by the Brownshirts and their Commander.

Freud and Dorothy stand together, watching from the window as
Anna is ushered into a waiting car. Anna looks up, before
disappearing.

Once they are gone, Freud, devastated, turns back inside with
his wife, refusing to acknowledge Dorothy's grief.
                                                             48.


68   INT. FREUD'S STUDY � CONT                                    68

     Freud looks out the window, a vacant stare.

                         FREUD
               Twelve hours we waited.

                         LEWIS
               Why did they let her go?

     Freud shrugs.

                         FREUD
               She was no use to them.    Anna is an
               innocent.

     Lewis stares back at Freud.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               When she was released I bribed
               everyone necessary to leave the
               country immediately. It took near
               tragedy for me see Hitler as the
               monster he is.

                         LEWIS
               History is filled with monsters.

                         FREUD
               Hitler learns from history. A
               warrior's greatest ally is always
               God. When Hitler claims crushing
               the Jews is "God's work" he raises
               an army who worships them both. At
               my age, I am grateful I won't live
               to see the next Hitler, thank God.

     Lewis is surprised. He must have heard incorrectly.

                         LEWIS
               What did you say?

     For the first time, Freud is speechless, scowls.

                                                        CUT TO:

69   EXT. SACRED HEART CATHOLIC CHURCH � VIENNA - 1863            69

     Freud's NANNY, ILSA, pulls the seven-year-old Freud up the
     church steps, late.

                         FREUD (V.O.)
               I was raised by a strict Catholic
               Nanny who dragged me to church
               every Sunday.


70   INT. CHURCH                                                     70

     Freud and Ilsa genuflect as people move down the pew,
     allowing them to slide in.

                         PRIEST (O.S.)
               In nomine Patris, et Fillii, et
               Spiritus Sancti.

                           FREUD, ILSA, CONGREGATION
               AMEN.

     THE CHOIR voices and the organ's music fill the church.

                         TANTUM ERGO � HYMN
               Veneremur cernui:
               Et antiquum documentum
               Novo cedat ritui:
               Praestet fides supplementum
               Sensuum defectui.

     Young Freud and Ilsa sing along. As they do, the boy looks
     around in wonderment at the church's rich adornment:

     Huge marble pillars and archways, with the clouds of Heaven
     above and cherubs smiling down on them.

     Lovingly carved wood panels frame the enormous stained glass
     windows depicting the stations of the cross.

     Young Freud focuses on the wall carving of a Saint. Her sad,
     knowing eyes seem to stare back into his. She is the same
     Saint we saw earlier in the CHURCH used for the BOMB SHELTER.

     Ilsa sees him staring.

                         ILSA
                   (whispers)
               Saint Dymphna.

71   INT. FREUD FAMIY HOME - LATER                                  71

     Freud's father, Jacob, reads from Deuteronomy.

                         JACOB
                   (in Hebrew)
               For you are crossing the Jordan, to
               come to possess the land which the
               Lord, your God, is giving you. And
               you shall keep to perform all the
               statutes and ordinances that I am
               setting before you, today.

     Jacob kisses the prayer book, then looks up to see Freud
     making the sign of the cross. He can't believe his eyes.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
                   (shocked)
               Was war das? (What was that?)


72   EXT. FREUD FAMILY HOME � MOMENTS LATER                         72

     The front door opens and Jacob Freud is putting Ilsa out on
     the street. Jacob is furious, she equally so. Jacob roughly
     hands Ilsa her suitcase.

     Ilsa sees Young Freud standing behind his Father. This stops
     both their tirades. She leans down to him.

                         ILSA
               You must pray for your Father so he
               can go to heaven.

                         JACOB
               There is no heaven!

                         ILSA
               Not for you there isn't!

                          JACOB
               GO! NOW!

     She turns, leaving them.     Jacob grabs his son by his arm.

                         JACOB (CONT.) (CONT'D)
               DO NOT PRAY FOR ME! EVER! SIGMUND!
               DO YOU HEAR ME?

     Freud doesn't answer, devastated, as he watches his nanny
     walk out of his life.
                                                             51.


73   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                              73

     Freud paces the room.

                         FREUD
               Battling Bibles. Love our neighbors
               as ourselves? You heard the radio,
               it's a simple minded impossibility.

                         LEWIS
               I disagree-

                         FREUD
               Of course you do! Your faith
               collapses otherwise!

     Freud grows more and more irate. He takes out his
     handkerchief, sometimes raising it to wipe his lips.

                         FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
               Turn the other cheek? Should Poland
               turn the other cheek to Hitler?
               Should they love their neighbors as
               German tanks crush their homes?

     His speech becomes slurred, his pain obvious.

                         FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
               Do you think it coincidence that
               Jesus demands his followers must be
               like children to enter Heaven? It's
               because man has never matured
               enough to face that he is alone in
               the universe and religion makes the
               world his nursery! I have two words
               for you, GROW UP!

     Freud begins to cough into his handkerchief, turning away.
     Lewis rises and goes to him.

     Freud raises his hand to keep Lewis away. He turns, wiping
     his mouth. There is a spot of blood on his handkerchief.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               Oral surgery. Then, badly fitting
               dentures. I worry constantly I will
               sneeze my teeth out. I need my
               medicine-

                         LEWIS
               Sit.

     Lewis pulls a chair to him.
                                                                52.


                         FREUD
               They never fit properly. Anna calls
               it "The Monster." I must clean it
               and call her to readjust it.

                         LEWIS
               When will your wife be home?

                         FREUD
               No one but Anna touches it.

                         LEWIS
               Not even your doctors?

                         FREUD
               Especially not my doctors!


74   INT. VIENNA HOSPITAL � FLASHBACK - THREE YEARS PREVIOUS       74

     Out of surgery, Freud is being pushed down the hallway on a
     gurney.

                         FREUD (V.O.)
               Endless operations and I should
               have learned from the first.

     He's still sedated, with a white towel under his chin.

     Sounds of the hospital echo as if they are coming from far
     away. Unintelligible voices, oddly colored shapes.

     ETHER DREAMS:

     THE CORRIDOR IS LINED BY TOWERING VERSIONS OF THE GODS FROM
     FREUD'S OFFICE, EROTIC, SURREAL.

     THE GURNEY PASSES A MARBLE STATUE OF A BEARDED GOD AND A
     YOUNG WOMAN COPULATING ON STONY GROUND.

     BUT WHEN THE SISTER PUSHES THE GURNEY PAST THEM, THEY ARE
     REVEALED AS HUMAN: THE GOD CINYRAS AND HIS DAUGHTER MYRRHA, A
     REPLICATION OF THE ILLUSTRATION IN DANTE'S "INFERNO.

     DRAWING BACK FROM THEIR KISS WE SEE MYRRAH IS NOT DISSIMILAR
     TO ANNA.-

     SOUND OF A HIGH PITCHED SCREAM--


75   INT. SMALL RECOVERY ROOM � FLASHBACK CONT.                    75

     C.U. FREUD'S SHUT EYES.   With a start, he opens them, then
     gapes, horrified--
                                                                53.


     A SCREAMING, HYDROCEPHALIC DWARF IN A HOSPITAL GOWN,
     TERRIFIED, POINTS AT FREUD.

     We see that the white towel is soaked through with blood.
     Freud tries to speak, but blood pours from his mouth.

     The frightened DWARF runs out the door and down the hall.

                         FREUD (V.O)
               He saved me.


76   INT. FREUD'S STUDY � CONT                                    76

     C.U. OF THE INCA SUN GOD on a cabinet. Gleaming gold and
     crowned, its eyes blank, mouth wide open.

                         FREUD
               He ran for the nurse. If it wasn't
               for him I would have died.

     Beside the Inca Sun God is a marble reproduction of the
     sculpture entitled "CINYRAS and MYRRHA."

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
               I find terrible humor in that. The
               eminent intellectual saved by a
               brain damaged dwarf. Now, that is a
               joke. Can there be a better one?

                         LEWIS
               Maybe not. But if it was a joke,
               who do you think made it?

     Freud pauses. He has no answer.

                         FREUD
               You might have just made a joke
               yourself.
                   (rises)
               Your first.

     Just then the phone rings.

                         FREUD (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
               Dr. Schur? Where are you?!


77   INT. INSTITUTE LECTURE HALL                                     77

     Anna Freud addresses the packed classroom.

                         ANNA
               Children aren't necessarily afraid,
               of war. Instead of running away,
               they might run toward it with
               primitive excitement. The real
               danger isn't that a child might
               react with shock. The danger is
               that the violence of the world
               might meet the violence inside the
               child.

     Dorothy appears at the door.   She puts her hand to her ear,
     indicating a phone call.

                         ANNA (CONT.) (CONT'D)
                   (immediately)
               Let's take a moment.

     Anna quickly walks down the aisle.

     it to her.

                         ANNA

                         FREUD
                   (on phone)
               Dr. Schur is not coming! He blames
               the traffic, he can't get into
               town. He will call my prescription
               into a chemist.

                         ANNA'S VOICE ON PHONE
               Do you want me to come home-

                         FREUD

               Of course! Why else would I call?!

                         ANNA'S VOICE ON PHONE
               It's just before you didn't-
                                                             55.


                         FREUD
                   (on phone)
               I AM IN TERRIBLE PAIN!
                   (off Lewis, in German)
               DENK DOCH EINMAL AN MICH UND NICHT
               IMMER NUR AN SIE! (THINK OF ME FOR
               ONCE! NOT ALWAYS HER!)


80   INT. INSTITUTE OFFICE - SAME                                 80

     Anna is cowed, a vulnerable child again.

                          ANNA
                   (on phone)
               Ja, Vater.

                         FREUD'S VOICE ON PHONE
               Finde einen chemiker! (Find a
               chemist!)

     ANNA winces at the sound of the phone being banged down in
     her ear. She looks up, very embarrassed.

                         ANNA
               There is an emergency. Could
               someone dismiss my class?

                         SECRETARY
               Of course, Miss Freud.

     Dr. Berbridge enters and hears this, very angry.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               Out of five scheduled lectures in
               the last two weeks you've cancelled
               two and today you're leaving
               halfway through your third!

                         ANNA
               It's unavoidable. My Father is in
               great pain and he needs me.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               As do we. Now more than ever. You
               must have domestics who can assist
               him. Surely you can bring in a
               Nurse?!

                         ANNA
               He doesn't want that.
                                                             56.


                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               With all respect, does your Father
               always get everything he wants?!

                         ANNA
               Doctor, you, as much as anyone,
               know the importance of my Father's
               work. Beside his creating your
               Occupation, and mine. So, yes, he
               gets anything he wants.

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               Including your life?!

                         ANNA
               If you have a problem-

                         DR. BERBRIDGE
               I think the problem is yours. It's
               called an Attachment Disorder.
               Idolizing ones parents past
               adolescence isn't a virtue, it's a
               compulsion!

     CLOSE on ANNA'S face as she fights to remain unemotional.

                         DOROTHY (O.S.)
               That's quite enough, doctor.   Anna,
               are you alright?

     Anna, shamed, immediately exits.


81   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                             81

     Freud, still by the phone, settles himself. Lewis turns away,
     uncomfortable. He looks over at the many photos in the room,
     can't help but notice one of himself, surprised and
     flattered. It rests beside a photo of Anna lecturing.

                         LEWIS
               Your Daughter teaches?

                         FREUD
               She also has a private
               psychoanalytical practice for
               children. I feared that by
               following in my footsteps she might
               leave no mark of her own. But Anna
               is dedicated to the science.

     Lewis puts the photo back.
                                                   57.


                    LEWIS
          And to you, it seems.

Lewis looks around him.

                    LEWIS (CONT'D)
          Do you have a photograph of your
          wife?

                     FREUD
          Of course.
              (pause)
          In the parlor.

Freud is irritated at Lewis' personal questions.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Are you married?

                    LEWIS
          No.

                    FREUD
          Do you live with anyone? A woman?
          A man?

                    LEWIS
          Pardon?

                    FREUD
          Does homosexuality offend you? It
          should not. Homosexuality is
          neurotic but not immoral.

                    LEWIS
          Why so?

                    FREUD
          Moral sense in man is produced by
          fear, begun with the castration
          complex.

                    LEWIS
              (amused)
          So, women have nothing to fear?

                     FREUD
          Exactly. Which is why they are so
          dangerous.
              (off his look)
          Women are born amoral and
          conniving. With no fear of
          castration, these impulses cannot
          be countered.
                                                                 58.


                         LEWIS
                   (skeptical)
               Then how are they "countered"?

                         FREUD
               By traditional relationships with
               their Husbands, and Fathers.

     Lewis can hardly comprehend what he is hearing, stares at the
     old man.

                         LEWIS
               But you've been one of the most
               supportive voices for women in your
               own field? You are a walking
               contradiction.

                         FREUD
               I am human. Inherently flawed.
               Damaged, and no doubt damaging to
               others.


82   INT. SCHOOL COATROOM - CONTINUOUS                             82

     Anna enters the large coatroom, closes the door behind her,
     taking a moment of refuge. She hugs her coat tightly in the
     dark, steadying herself, just trying to breathe. She closes
     her eyes.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
               Tell me your family's secrets...


83   INT. GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - FLASHBACK                         83

     Anna sits on the floor of a cold, dark, wet cell.   She's
     shivering, and has been there for hours.

     She closes her eyes, hugging her knees closer to her chest.
     She looks down at the pillbox that her father gave her,
     staring at it.

     Her eyes widen in fear when a door opens and she hears
     footsteps approach her cell.

     SOUND: BANGING ON THE DOOR


84   INT. SCHOOL COATROOM - CONT.                                  84

     Dorothy opens the door and finds Anna, shaken.
                                                               59.


                          DOROTHY
               Anna?   Are you alright?

                         ANNA
                   (gathers herself)
               It's nothing.

                         DOROTHY
               You're frightened. Tell me.

     Anna grabs her coat and tries to play it off.

                         ANNA
               I'm just worried about my Father. I
               have to find a chemist.

                         DOROTHY
               Is your Mother-

                         ANNA
               She's away. He has no one.

                         DOROTHY
               There must be someone-

                          ANNA
               Me!

     Dorothy is taken aback by the force of her desperation.


85   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                  85

     Anna pulls her coat on, heading toward the school's entrance
     with Dorothy in tow.

                         DOROTHY
               Chemists are closing early like
               every other business. Let's make
               some calls first.

                         ANNA
               I'll find one on the way home.

     Dorothy takes her own coat.

                         DOROTHY
               Then we'll go together.

                         ANNA
               Absolutely not!
                                                             60.


                         DOROTHY
               I've waited for you my entire life,
               I'm not going to lose you now.

                         ANNA
               I'll be perfectly safe and you have
               classes.

                         DOROTHY
               Anna! Enough! Please.

     Anna stops.

                         DOROTHY (CONT'D)
               Don't we have more now to be afraid
               of?

     She stares at Dorothy, unable to answer.


86   EXT. INSTITUTE - CONT.                                    86

     Dorothy follows her out to the street. Loud traffic, packed
     sidewalks, the city electrified with the anticipation of war.

                         DOROTHY
               Berbridge isn't wrong, you know.
               If any patient of yours showed this
               kind of codependency you'd diagnose
               them with an attachment disorder.

                         ANNA
               This is my duty, why can't you see
               that?

                         DOROTHY
               Duty is not the same thing as
               cringing servitude.

                         ANNA
               HE IS MY FATHER!

                         DOROTHY
               And what else? Is that all?!

     Anna, is stung.

                         ANNA
               How dare you.

     Anna hurries down the steps alone and joins the crowd on the
     sidewalk. Dorothy watches her go.
                                                       61.


87   INT. FREUD'S STUDY �                                    87

     Freud lights a cigar. Lewis watches astonished.

                         LEWIS
               Doesn't smoking aggravate your
               mouth?

                         FREUD
               Of course. But I am determined to
               revel in my only sexual pleasure
               left. I've bid farewell to my
               phallic and anal stages and
               regressed to my oral.

     Lewis looks at his watch.

                         LEWIS
               Extraordinary. We've been talking
               this long and this is the first
               mention of sex.

                         FREUD
               Your definition is too narrow. I
               apply the term "sexual" to all
               interactions that bring pleasurable
               feelings. Genital contact, an
               infant sucking at its mother's
               breast, my cigar. Sexuality is the
               font of all happiness.

                         LEWIS
               There's much more to happiness than
               that. Sex is only one of many God
               given pleasures and not the most
               lasting.

     Freud looks at his watch.

                         FREUD
               Extraordinary. It took you less
               than a minute to bring god into
               sex. Still, despite church
               propaganda, we have made great
               progress overcoming our
               repressions.

                         LEWIS
               Progress? We've gone from sex being
               the subject never spoken of to our
               being unable to talk about anything
               else. It's as if we invented it.
                                                62.


                    FREUD
          Psychoanalysis is inherently
          sexual. And we hardly-

                    LEWIS
          Oh yes. We infantilize it, turning
          it into the lie that sex under any
          circumstances is normal and
          healthy. There is a sexual code
          running through the Old and New
          Testaments. Sex is to be shared by
          two people who are committed to
          each other-

Freud turns on Lewis.

                    FREUD
          Your Bible is a bestiary of
          sexuality! You handpick verses to
          support your own bias! "No sex
          before marriage'. It's not only
          na�ve, it's mindless cruelty. Like
          sending a young man to perform his
          first concerto with an orchestra
          when the only time he's ever played
          his piccolo was alone in his room!

Lewis can't help but laugh.

                    LEWIS
          I'd think needing to depend on men
          would cause women to give up sex
          completely. Especially since you
          say homosexuality isn't immoral.

Freud is getting more and more agitated.

                    FREUD
          Lesbianism is a much different
          matter.

                    LEWIS
          How so?

                    FREUD
          Unchecked, lesbians become
          progressively more and more
          unstable.

                    LEWIS
          But not homosexuals?
                                                          63.


                    FREUD
          No! Their conditions have very
          different sources.

                    LEWIS
          I don't understand. What's the
          source of a woman's lesbianism?

                    FREUD
          Her Father!

Freud stops himself, Lewis is taken aback by his vehemence.

The old man settles, trying to compose himself, trying to put
the focus back on Lewis

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          And what of your Father?

Lewis takes a beat, isn't certain he wants to continue.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          It's too late to turn back now.

                    LEWIS
              (guarded)
          My Father and I made our peace
          before he died. He was a good man.
          What he could't afford emotionally
          he made up for financially,
          supporting my life's work... I
          live with my brother.

Freud senses he is hiding something.

                    FREUD
          Just your brother?

                    LEWIS
          It's complicated.

                    FREUD
          It usually is.

                    LEWIS
          I told you I was in the war.

Lewis hesitates.   Freud leans back.

                    FREUD
          No, you showed me you were in the
          war... Always back to the war...

                                                  CUT TO:
                                                             64.


88   EXT.   THE SOMME, FRANCE - NIGHT                            88

     A YOUNG LEWIS, 19, already war-worn, and his friend PADDY
     MOORE, 20, march towards the front.

     The night sky lights up before them in bursts of artillery.
     It is loud and foreboding.

                          PADDY MOORE
                You alright, mate?

     Lewis just stares out, he is anything but alright.


89   EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT                                         89

     Rainwater has filled the trench they are crouched in,
     huddling under their coats. They listen to the rifle fire.
     Clusters of bombs exploding, screams from down the line.

     Paddy pulls out a photo, stares at it.

                          PADDY MOORE
                I suppose I should have some
                starlet's pic. Just me mum.

                          LEWIS
                If I still had a mum I'm sure I'd
                do the same.

                           PADDY MOORE
                JESUS!

     He jumps aside, a small army of rats run over his shoes, past
     Lewis.

                          LEWIS
                There goes dinner.

     They both laugh, despite the misery.

                          PADDY MOORE
                Lewis? Make me a promise. If
                something happens to me, take care
                of my Mother. And if anything
                happens to you I'll do the same for
                your Father.

     Lewis just nods, a pact.
                                                               65.


90   INT. FREUD'S STUDY �                                             90

     Freud continues to question Lewis, who is determined to get
     away from the subject.

                         FREUD
               How much of that night do you
               remember?

                         LEWIS
                   (dismissive)
               Little to none... It was chaos
               from the outset...

     Lewis instinctively looks at the door, then forces himself to
     steady and look back at Freud, who is waiting patiently.
     Lewis is not getting out of this.

                         LEWIS (CONT'D)
               It was my last time going over the
               bags... Paddy and I made it into
               no man's land...

     THE COMMANDER'S WHISTLE SOUNDS


91   EXT. NO MAN'S LAND - CONT.                                   91

     Smoke and fog fill the battlefield. Artillery and gun fire
     sound out but Lewis and Paddy are lost in the haze, racing
     forward.

     Lewis and Paddy leap forward into a ditch from a mortar
     blast. LEWIS is breathing heavily.

     They crouch low, pinned down. Before Lewis are remnants of
     the roots from a tree once there.

     Lewis touches the roots- and for a brief moment he is back in
     his Fantasy Forest.

     STILLNESS AND SILENCE

     A baby deer approaches Lewis timidly. He smiles.

     Coming closer, the fawn looks up to him with her huge,
     trusting eyes -

     THEN JOLTED BACK to reality by a mortar blast and Lewis falls
     backwards-

                          PADDY MOORE (V.O.
               Jack!   You all right?!
                                                                66.


     Lewis nods, trying to catch his breath. The volume of the
     gunfire is deafening. Gunpowder floats in the air.

                           PADDY MOORE (CONT'D)
                     (shouting to be heard)
                 They've got all of Berlin over
                 there! We can't stay here!

     Lewis, covered now in mud, wipes his eyes, raises up and
     begins firing. He looks over to Paddy when--

     A DIRECT HIT BY A MORTAR SHELL.

     Lewis reels, in shock, ears ringing, he looks around him
     frantically only to find Paddy lying dead. Lewis forces
     himself to take his personals, including the photo of Paddy's
     mother. He looks back at his friend a last time and turns to
     run -

     ANOTHER EXPLOSION

     This one sends Lewis sliding, falling down into a cave
     beneath no man's land.

     He lands hard, jammed against a wall, surrounded by dead
     bodies, claustrophobic, still gripping the photo.

     BLACKOUT.


92   INT.   ENDLEIGH PALACE HOSPITAL � LATER                      92

     Lewis lays in a hospital bed, his chest bandaged. Wounded
     patients lie in beds down a long hallway, understaffed.
     Lewis just stares at the ceiling in pain and exhaustion.

                           JANIE MOORE (O.S.)
                 I was going to take you out dancing-

     He looks up to see Janie Moore, Paddy's Mother, standing
     there holding a covered basket.

                           JANIE MOORE (CONT'D)
                 But you'll have to settle for a
                 picnic here instead.

     For the first time in forever Lewis smiles.

                           LEWIS
                 Mrs. Moore?
                     (off her nod)
                 I'm so sorry...

     She can't hold his gaze.
                                                           67.


LATER

Janie helps Lewis steady a teacup he sips from. Finished, she
puts it onto a tray and hands Lewis a cookie. He takes a bite
and is transported.

                    LEWIS (CONT'D)
          These taste like they were made
          with actual butter.

                    JANIE MOORE
          They were! Our neighbors take
          trading ration coupons as seriously
          as if they were Lloyd's of London.

                    LEWIS
          In the field we ate Maconachie for
          breakfast, Lunch and dinner.

                    JANIE MOORE
          "Maconachie"?

                    LEWIS
          Ground up fat pretending to be
          rancid meat. Cold, it's inedible.
          Hot, it's near fatal.

Both smile.

                    LEWIS (CONT'D)
          I can't tell you how much your
          visit means to me.

                    JANIE MOORE
          It's nothing. The letters you wrote
          me after Paddy's death keep me
          close to him.

Lewis reaches for something. It is the photo from Paddy.

                    LEWIS
          He carried this with him.

She holds it, pauses to collect herself.

                    JANIE MOORE
          You keep it.
              (forces a smile)
          Now Jack, we need to talk about
          something quite serious. You told
          me the promise you and Paddy made
          with each other.
                    (MORE)
                                                             68.

                         JANIE MOORE (CONT'D)
               It's a lovely gesture, but I don't
               need anyone being my `guardian
               angel'. I might look ancient to
               you-

                         LEWIS
               Of course not.

                         JANIE MOORE
               The right reply. Not to mention
               that I don't believe in angels, or
               depending on anyone but myself.

                         LEWIS
               So let's not look at it as a
               "Guardianship." Let's call it a
               friendship.

     Janie considers this, and slowly smiles.

                         JANIE MOORE
               Agreed.

     She takes his fingers poking out of the cast to shake on it,
     and they both laugh. There is an immediate, surprising
     chemistry.

                         JANIE MOORE (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
               A very special friendship.


93   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                           93

     Freud stares at Lewis, surprised. Almost impressed.

                         FREUD
               Your friend's Mother?

                         LEWIS
               I made a promise.

                         FREUD
               How long have you had this
               relationship?

                         LEWIS
               I wouldn't call it a
               "relationship".

                         FREUD
               Any bond between two people is a
               relationship. How old was she?
                                                           69.


                         LEWIS
               Mrs. Moore was in her early
               forties.

                         FREUD
               Does "Mrs. Moore" have a first
               name?

                         LEWIS
                   (reluctantly)
               Janie.

                         FREUD
               "Janie." Did you think Janie an
               attractive woman when you met?

                         LEWIS
               She was the Mother of my friend.

                         FREUD
               Which might make her more
               attractive. Many men who lose
               their mothers at an early age are
               drawn to mature women.

                         LEWIS
               I resent your implication, and my
               personal life is not your concern.

                         FREUD
               Your conversion is. You lived with
               her in your days as an atheist, so
               I would like to know whether your
               conversion or battle trauma caused
               a newfound virginity.

                         LEWIS
               I won't discuss this further. My
               private life is precisely that.

                         FREUD
               As you wish. But I always consider
               what people tell me less important
               than what they cannot.

     The doorbell rings. Lewis looks relieved.


94   INT. FREUD'S HOME                                          94

     Lewis opens the door to the visitor and greets him.

                         LEWIS
               Hello. Can I help you?
                                                               70.


                         DR. ERNEST JONES
               No one can today, I'm afraid. Is
               Miss Freud in?

                         LEWIS
               I'm afraid not, she's-

     Freud appears behind him.

                         FREUD
               Ernest!

     The two doctors embrace, then Dr. Jones turns to Lewis,
     introducing himself.

                         JONES
               Ernest Jones.

                         LEWIS
               C.S. Lewis. A pleasure.
                   (turns to Freud)
               I should leave you to your Doctor.

                         FREUD
               Dr. Jones is not my physician.

                         JONES
               Better than a Doctor, a friend.

     Jofi enters the hallway and barks.

                         FREUD
               Jofi! You remember Dr. Jones!

                         JONES
               I just stopped by for a moment.    I
               didn't know you had company.

                         LEWIS
               I think I'll take a stroll around
               the block for some air.

                         FREUD
               Excellent idea.

     Freud looks from Lewis to Jofi.


95   EXT. FREUD'S FRONT DOOR � MOMENTS LATER                     95

     Resigned, Lewis leaves through the front door with Jofi on a
     leash. He looks out to see the fall day already darkening.
                                                            71.


96   INT. FREUD'S PARLOR                                         96

     Freud and Jones enter the parlor. Conventionally decorated,
     its furnishings are clearly not Freud's choices.

                         JONES
               Your color is better.

                         FREUD
               Your eyes are worse. I hope you're
               not here to pack me off to another
               country? It's too late for that.

                         JONES
                   (smiling)
               I'll return our tickets to Iceland.

     They sit. Jones seems less confident now.

                         JONES (CONT'D)
               You've met my Sister, Rosalyn.

                            FREUD
               Stutterer.

                         JONES
               Overcome. She and her family live
               in Northumberland. No place to
               bomb, more sheep than people. But
               I'm told they're assembling a first
               rate psychoanalytic facility in
               Bury. A teaching hospital.

                         FREUD
               You don't really expect me to move
               in my condition?

                         JONES
               No. Of course not... I was thinking
               of Anna.

     Jones looks for a reaction, Freud remains still.

                         JONES (CONT'D)
               They'd love to have her, of course,
               and it would be a winning
               proposition for both of them.

                         FREUD
               Because she'd be safer there?

                         JONES
               That's one reason, yes.
                                                             72.


                         FREUD
               And the other?

                         JONES
               They've asked me to join the
               faculty.

     Jones braces himself for Freud's reaction.


97   EXT. LONDON STREET � APOTHECARY SHOP - CONT.                97

     Anna sees the sign "CLOSED" but nonetheless tries the door.
     Definitely locked. Determined to find another, she walks
     briskly, then runs toward a stopping trolleybus.

     An anxious crowd is boarding. The Operator stops the line at
     the man and woman before her.

                         OPERATOR
               Sorry. We're full up.

                         ANNA
               Sir, please, I need to get home.

     The operator cocks his head toward the standing room only
     passengers behind him.

                         OPERATOR
               Same as everybody else. Step away,
               please.

     Anna does, but persists.

                         ANNA
               My Father is having a medical
               crisis. He needs help, immediately.

                         OPERATOR
               I'm sorry, miss.

                         ANNA
                   (playing last card)
               My Father is Dr. Sigmund Freud!

     Clearly, the operator knows who Freud is.

                         OPERATOR
               The Sex Doc? Good luck to both of
               you.

     The operator shuts the door, pulling away.
                                                               73.


98   INT. FREUD'S PARLOR                                            98

     Freud's mood is darkening.

                         FREUD
               Help me, I am confused. Are you
               seeking a professional relationship
               with Anna or a personal one?

                         JONES
               Actually...that would be Anna's
               choice, don't you think?

     Freud's stare levels Jones.

                         FREUD
               Do you, Ernest?


99   EXT. LONDON STREET                                             99

     Anna tries another Chemist's door despite the "CLOSED" sign.
     She peers in and sees no one. About to leave, she stops and
     looks up to the apartment over the store.

                         ANNA
               IS ANYONE HOME? HELLO!   I NEED
               HELP!

     Anna looks around for something to toss at the window.
     Finding nothing she takes off her shoe and throws it.

                         CHEMIST (O.S.)
               Throw `em both! My wife loves
               shoes.

     Anna looks up to see an Old Man leaning out the window.

                         ANNA
               Are you the chemist? I need a
               prescription filled. It's an
               emergency and I -

     The Chemist makes a sign of dismissal and vanishes from the
     window. Anna looks around her, frustrated. Where can she go
     now? The Chemist's door opens.

                         CHEMIST
               I do a good deed once a war.    Who's
               your Doctor?
                                                              74.


100   INT.   FREUD'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS                          100

      Dr. Jones watches as Freud rises, looking out the window.

                           FREUD
                 Has Anna ever given you any
                 indication she would be interested
                 in a relationship?

                           JONES
                 No, but... I've spent little time
                 with her, socially. She has many
                 responsibilities, I understand-

                           FREUD
                 Or perhaps she is disinterested.

                           JONES
                 I think she could only benefit by a
                 wider circle of professional and
                 personal acquaintances.

                           FREUD
                 Beside myself.

                           JONES
                     (reddens)
                 I didn't mean to infer-

                           FREUD
                 Of course not.

                           JONES
                 Perhaps we could talk again after
                 you've had some time to think.

                           FREUD
                 Not necessary.

                           JONES
                     (hopeful)
                 I can speak with her, then?

                           FREUD
                 No.

                           JONES
                 Can I ask why?

                           FREUD
                 Anna and I have an understanding
                 that she will not consider any
                 relationship until we both feel it
                 is suitable.
                           (MORE)
                                                              75.

                           FREUD (CONT'D)
                 You are twenty years older than
                 her. Anna is still a girl, she is
                 too young to even experience sexual
                 longing.

                           JONES
                     (stunned)
                 Do you even hear yourself? Anna
                 spent years in psychoanalytical
                 treatment for a masturbation
                 complex, which proves she is
                 capable of sexual longing. A
                 complex that most often stems from
                 her unhealthy paternal attachment.
                 Not that you need concern yourself,
                 doctor. Primum non nocere. I'm
                 sure you remember that.

      Freud glares at Jones, knows he's right.


101   EXT. STREET - CONT.                                      101

      Anna is in a cab.

                           ANNA
                 Hurry, please.

      The cab picks up speed, Anna sinks back in her seat.


102   INT.   FREUD APARTMENT, VIENNA - FLASHBACK               102

      Anna waits nervously as the door to her father's study opens.
      Out walks Dorothy, looking a little frazzled.

      Anna follows her, sees their Viennese housekeeper watching.

                            DOROTHY
                 Don't.

                           ANNA
                 What could I possibly ask?

                           DOROTHY
                 My therapy session are mine alone.
                 Find your own therapist.

                           ANNA
                 I just might... You do look like a
                 bit flushed. I wonder what you
                 could have talked about that would
                 have caused that.
                                                                 76.


                           DOROTHY
                 Wouldn't you like to know.

      Dorothy gives her a sideways glance. Anna suppresses a grin
      as she follows her out into the hallway and closes the door.


103   INT.   STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                               103

      Dorothy walks up the stairs.     Anna follows.

                           ANNA
                 It must be very convenient to live
                 upstairs from your analyst.

                           DOROTHY
                 I could say the same of you having
                 me so close.

                           ANNA
                 I do find it very convenient. But
                 I wonder what you could have
                 possibly discussed that has aroused
                 such a physical response.

                           DOROTHY
                 Wouldn't you like to know.
                     (off Anna)
                 Everything to do with you and
                 nothing at all.

                           ANNA
                 So then he knows?

      They come to Dorothy's door.     She takes a beat, turns back to
      Anna, takes her hands.

                             DOROTHY
                 He knows.

      Anna swallows hard. Dorothy opens her door to see her two
      small children. Anna smiles to herself, follows Dorothy
      inside as the children rush to hug her, and the door shuts.


104   INT.   TAXI - SAME                                          104

      Anna stares out the window of the taxi, closes her eyes,
      remembering.
                                                              77.


105   INT. A DARK ROOM - FLASHBACK                                105

      Anna is stretched out on a couch in a dark room. There's pain
      and pleasure in her telling.

                          ANNA
                    (low, aroused)
                It's the same fantasy I always
                have. We're on horseback. His
                family hates mine, he's avenging
                them. I can't escape. He's coming
                closer, closer- Then he kisses me.
                Everywhere I'm bleeding. His face
                to mine, his lips near my lips, red
                and dripping. He whispers - "Tell
                me your family's secrets."

                                                         CUT TO:


106   EXT. LONDON STREET                                             106

      Lewis and Jofi proceed down the block, passing shops and
      residences, where citizens prepare for war, taping glass,
      blacking out windows, while soldiers place sandbags.

      TWO TEEN NEWSPAPER VENDORS out shout one another with
      headlines: "WE'RE AT WAR", the other, "WAR DECLARED"

      But Lewis sees none of this. He sees only the past.


107   INT. THE KILNS - AFTER DINNER - FLASHBACK                   107

      Janie and Lewis do dishes. She washes, he dries.

                          LEWIS
                We should invite the Tolkeins for
                dinner during school break.

                          JANIE MOORE
                You see him at your meetings, don't
                you?

                          LEWIS
                Yes, but not Edith.

                          JANIE MOORE
                That's fine with me.

                          LEWIS
                I thought you liked Edith?
                                                              78.


                          JANIE MOORE
                More than she likes me. She
                doesn't approve of our living
                together, you know how Catholics
                are.

                           LEWIS
                As far as she's concerned you're my
                land lady.
                    (off Janie, stung)
                She's never said a word about it.

                          JANIE MOORE
                She doesn't have to. She converted
                for him, Jack!

                          LEWIS
                I know-

                          JANIE MOORE
                I won't do it!

                          LEWIS
                I'd never ask you to!

                          JANIE MOORE
                And I won't sit around the table,
                holding hands with the three of you
                and thanking God for the meal I
                made!

      Janie storms out of the room, Lewis follows her.

                          LEWIS
                Janie!


108   INT. KILNS - SECOND FLOOR                                108

      Janie rushes into her bedroom, tries to slam the door closed,
      but Lewis pushes it open.

                          JANIE MOORE
                I don't know who you are.

                          LEWIS
                You do.

                          JANIE MOORE
                You're not the same person! I can't
                live this way any longer. I'm
                leaving. I have to.
                                                                79.


                             LEWIS
                You don't.

                          JANIE MOORE
                Forget the promise you made with
                Paddy. I absolve you, Jack! Does
                absolution make you feel holy?

                          LEWIS
                Let's sit down and talk.

                          JANIE MOORE
                Where are my bags?

                          LEWIS
                In the attic, but-

                          JANIE MOORE
                I'll fetch them myself.

      JANIE exits. A beat later, she returns.

                          JANIE MOORE (CONT'D)
                You didn't stop me. You'd let me
                go, wouldn't you?

      She starts to cry, LEWIS goes to her, holds her. She looks up
      to him.

                          JANIE MOORE (CONT'D)
                Am I a sin? Is that what I am to
                you?

      Desperate, she tries to kiss him. He pulls back.

                             LEWIS
                No!

      They look at each other, both in pain.

                             LEWIS (CONT.) (CONT'D)
                I can't.

      SOUND OF BARKING


109   EXT. BOOK SHOP                                                109

      Lewis, still walking Jofi, notices one of Freud's books
      displayed in the window along with a photo of FREUD,
      announcing a local lecture, which has been postponed.

                          LEWIS
                He's inescapable.
                                                              80.


      Lewis looks down at Jofi, who relieves himself beneath the
      window.


110   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                          110

      SOUND of door closing, Jones has left.

      Freud enters, approaches the windows overlooking his garden
      and stares out, thinking, remembering.


111   EXT. VIENNA GARDEN � FLASHBACK                           111

      Freud watches his 4 year old grandson, Heinele, being chased
      by Anna, as he and his other daughter Sophie call
      encouragement.

                          SOPHIE
                Hurry Heinle! She's going to catch
                you! Hurry!

                          ANNA
                    (laughing)
                Sophie! He's too fast for me!

      Sophie is beautiful and we see Freud's eyes fill with joy at
      the sight of her with her son.

      Anna catches Heinele, both laughing. She allows him to "break
      free" and run from her and into the arms of Sophie, coming
      for him. They hug Heinele ferociously.

      For that moment, FREUD has found "Joy"


112   INT. FREUD'S STUDY � THE PRESENT                            112

      Freud turns away from the garden, caught between worlds for a
      moment. He hears the front door open, then shut. Lewis
      enters, taking off Jofi's leash.

                          FREUD
                Jofi has finished walking you?

                          LEWIS
                He recognized your book in the
                window where you were to speak.

                          FREUD
                Postponed... Indefinitely.

      Lewis picks up the dog and puts him in Freud's lap.
                                                        81.


                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Don't -

But it's too late. Jofi barks, jumps off Freud's lap as if
electrocuted and runs from the room. Lewis is surprised.

                    LEWIS
          I'm sorry, I thought-

Freud, flustered and embarrassed, hesitates, then decides to
tell him the truth.

                    FREUD
          I have oral cancer. These are not
          badly fitting dentures, it is a
          prosthesis. It seals off the roof
          of my mouth from the nasal cavity.
          The smell is clearly hideous.

                    LEWIS
          I don't smell it.

                    FREUD
          You're being kind. Jofi didn't run
          from you, he ran from me. The smell
          of decaying flesh.

Of course, Lewis smells it now, whether it's imaginary or
not.

                    FREUD (CONT) (CONT'D)
          Jofi is no longer this "man's best
          friend."

Freud picks up a small statue from his desk.

                    FREUD (CONT) (CONT'D)
          Do you know the Greek God, Momus?

                    LEWIS
          No.

                    FREUD
          He chastised the Gods for their
          absurdity in creating man and was
          banished to earth to live with
          them.

                    LEWIS
          Familiar theme.

                    FREUD
          Momus is the God of Irony.
                                                           82.


Lewis rises, indicating Freud's desk littered with deities.

                    LEWIS
          Such as this?
              (off Freud)
          What would you call a confirmed
          Nonbeliever whose desk is guarded
          by gods and goddesses?

                    FREUD
          A collector. I am simply interested
          in ancient belief systems, yours
          included.

                    LEWIS
          All sharing similar concepts. Right
          and wrong, good and evil. And a
          choice between them.

                     FREUD
          And if good is to be chosen, then
          your God who created it also
          created evil. Allowed Lucifer to
          live, to flourish, even when he
          logically should have been
          destroyed.

Freud raises a handkerchief to his mouth, dabbing at it.

                    LEWIS
          God gave Lucifer free will, which
          is the only thing that makes
          goodness possible. A world filled
          with choice-less creatures is a
          world of machines. It's men, not
          God, who created prisons, slavery,
          bombs. Man's suffering is the fault
          of man.

                    FREUD
          Is that your excuse for pain and
          suffering? Did I bring about my
          own cancer? Or is killing me God's
          revenge?

Lewis hesitates.

                    LEWIS
          I don't know.

Freud is taken aback.

                    FREUD
          You "don't know?!"
                                                        83.


                    LEWIS
          And I don't pretend to. It's the
          most difficult question of all,
          isn't it? If God is good, He would
          make His creatures perfectly happy.
          But we aren't. So God lacks
          goodness, or power, or both.

Freud pauses, at a loss.

                     FREUD
          Finally.   We are making progress.

More irritated, he takes out his handkerchief and adjusts his
prosthesis.

                    LEWIS
          What if God wants to perfect us
          through suffering? Make us realize
          that real happiness, eternal
          happiness, can only come through
          him? If pleasure is his whisper,
          pain is his megaphone.

Freud, growing more frustrated, paces around Lewis.

                    FREUD
          I'm sure Hitler, the little altar
          boy who served at Church every
          Sunday, would agree with you. But I
          cannot.
              (dismissive)
          We speak different languages. You
          believe in revelation. I believe in
          science, the authority of reason.
          There is no common ground.

                    LEWIS
          There is also the dictatorship of
          pride. Why does religion make room
          for science but science refuses to
          make room for religion?

                    FREUD
          How roomy was Galileo's cell when
          he first told the Pope the sun did
          not move around the earth?

                    LEWIS
          The stupidity of church leaders is
          too easy a target.
                                                        84.


                    FREUD
          They hide behind their ignorance!
          How can we understand? We are
          small, he is mighty!

Freud bears down on Lewis.

                    FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          My Daughter Sophie died of Spanish
          Flu at Twenty-Seven! A Wife, a
          Mother! Tuberculosis killed my
          Grandson at five years old!

Freud, furious, is now in Lewis' face.

                    FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          FIVE! What a brilliant plan of
          God's to murder him! I wish cancer
          had attacked my brain, instead.
          Then, perhaps, I could hallucinate
          there is a God and seek vengeance.

Incensed, Freud turns away, walking to the window looking out
at the street.

                    LEWIS
          How advanced is your cancer?

                    FREUD
              (pause)
          It's nearly eaten through my cheek.
          Inoperable. It's only a matter of
          time.

                    LEWIS
          How much time?

                    FREUD
          That is for me to decide. Dr.
          Schur and I have a pact.
              (off Lewis)
          Don't look at me that way. You
          don't have to say it. "Suicide is
          wrong, and a sin!"

                    LEWIS
          It is.

                    FREUD
          THEN LOOK INTO MY MOUTH AND YOU
          WILL SEE HELL HAS ARRIVED ALREADY!

Lewis doesn't let up.
                                                              85.


                          LEWIS
                Have you told your wife?

                          FREUD
                There's no point. My wife shares
                your superstitions.

                            LEWIS
                And Anna?

                          FREUD
                That I am dying? Of course.

                          LEWIS
                That you plan to kill yourself?

                          FREUD
                Why would I tell her? It would only
                bring her pain.

                          LEWIS
                You're protecting her? Or are you
                afraid she'd try to talk you out of
                it?

                          FREUD
                    (contemptuous)
                You are quite persistent. It is the
                most common trait of converts. And
                reformed alcoholics.

      Freud reaches into the box on his desk.

                            FREUD (CONT'D)
                Cigar?

      Off Lewis' incredulity -

                          FREUD (CONT'D)
                Is there anything else, Doctor?

                          LEWIS
                    (stung)
                Yes, actually.

      SOUND OF HORNS HONKING,


113   EXT. LONDON STREET - CONT.                               113

      Anna's cab brakes hard. They are caught in what looks like
      endless traffic.
                                                                 86.


                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                Is Anna married?

      Anna gets out of the cab, walking, half running down the
      crowded sidewalk.

                             FREUD (V.O.)
                No.


114   INT. FREUD'S STUDY- CONT.                                   114

      Lewis, hesitates, then takes down a framed photograph from
      the shelf - our view of it is blocked.

                          LEWIS
                I'm surprised.

      Freud waits to respond. Where is this going?

                          FREUD
                It's not a simple task for us to
                choose the right mate.

                          LEWIS
                You mean, for Anna to choose.

                             FREUD
                Of course.

                          LEWIS
                Dr. Jones today.

                          FREUD
                And what of him?

      Lewis looks at him - exactly.

                          LEWIS
                He asked to see Anna, not you.

      Lewis stares at the photo of Anna walking across a lawn with
      Freud, arms linked, brightly smiling. It has an intimate
      look, easily mistaken for a Young Woman and her Suitor. He
      places the photo on Freud's desk before him.

                           LEWIS (CONT'D)
                But, then, why would she need a
                mate? She has all the stimulation
                she needs.

      Freud controls his response.
                                                              87.


                          FREUD
                Do you have a question?

                          LEWIS
                Is she seeing someone? Man? Woman?
                Or both, since we're intrinsically
                bisexual.

                          FREUD
                With her teaching and her practice,
                Anna has no time.

                          LEWIS
                Except for you. You're very
                fortunate. Especially considering
                that she's the only person you
                permit to touch your mouth.

                          FREUD
                Anna is a professional.

                          LEWIS
                A physician?

                          FREUD
                No. I told you. Anna is a member of
                the Psychoanalytic Society.

                          LEWIS
                Don't members need to be Doctors?

                          FREUD
                There are exceptions.


115   EXT. LONDON STREET                                             115

      Anna begins to run. There is a desperation about her now.

      She's not just running, but running from something.

                          ANNA (V.O.)
                He takes my hand-


116   INT. ROOM - FLASHBACK CONT.                                 116

      Anna, on a couch, slides her hand down her side, then reaches
      under her dress.

                          ANNA
                He makes me touch him. There. And
                there.
                                                                88.


117   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                            117

                          FREUD
                Anna presented a paper that was
                very well received.

                          LEWIS
                It must have been. What was the
                subject?

                          FREUD
                    (pause)
                Sadomasochistic fantasies.

      Lewis looks up surprised.


118   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            118

      Anna keeps running, despite the tears starting to flow.


119   INT. OFFICE - FLASHBACK CONT.                              119

      Anna, excited, reaches the culmination of her dream.

                          ANNA
                But, I escape...

                          LEWIS (V.O.)
                These fantasies-


120   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                            120

      Lewis looks concerned, what lines has the old man crossed.

                          LEWIS
                Were they based on her patient's
                treatments?

                          FREUD
                Based on her own analysis.

                          LEWIS
                And who was her Analyst?

      No response. Freud looks away.

                          LEWIS (CONT'D)
                I asked who was her analyst?!

                          FREUD
                I WAS!
                                                              89.


121   INT.   STUDY - FLASHBACK CONT.                           121

      Anna continues on the couch. Only now we begin to recognize
      the surrounding, some of the statuary in the background.

                           ANNA
                     (frightened)
                 The Knight takes the boy in his
                 arms-

      A hand grabs her arm. It's her Father.

                           FREUD
                 NO MORE!! No more, Knights! No more
                 Boys!

      Anna's frightened. Freud stares at her with contempt.

                           FREUD (CONT'D)
                 I am not your Knight! And you are
                 not this boy! You are a girl! MY
                 DAUGHTER!

      He pauses. Collects himself.

                           FREUD (CONT'D)
                 My Daughter.

      Freud is shaken.

                           FREUD (CONT'D)
                 Anna, this is a mistake. It has led
                 only to pain, for both of us. I
                 can't do this for you anymore.

      Freud starts to stand, but Anna grabs his arm.

                           ANNA
                 You would send me to someone
                 lesser?! Who knows only what you
                 taught them!

      Distraught, she falls to her knees before him.

                           ANNA (CONT'D)
                 I need you! Please, Father! Don't
                 leave me!

      Overwhelmed, Anna takes his hands, puts her cheek to them.
      Freud looks down at his daughter, torn. And for the first
      time, helpless.
                                                            90.


122   INT. FREUD'S STUDY �                                       122

                          FREUD (CONT.)
                Do you have any more questions?

                          LEWIS
                Oh yes. But I won't presume to ask
                them. I will only remind you of
                your earlier observations.
                Psychoanalysis is inherently
                sexual. And what people say is
                less important than what they
                cannot.

      FREUD'S ANSWER is to turn on the RADIO.

      SOUND OF BBC ORCHESTRA PLAYING, Freud turns it off.

                          LEWIS (CONT'D)
                You do that every time.

                          FREUD
                We're waiting for news.

                          LEWIS
                Then why not just turn the music
                down? Why off?

                          FREUD
                I object to being manipulated. To
                me, it's all church music.

                          LEWIS
                My objection to church music is
                that it trivializes emotions I
                already feel. I think you're afraid
                to feel them at all.

      Freud glares at him offended.

                          FREUD
                Is that your diagnosis? Doctor?

                          LEWIS
                Not all of it.

      Lewis comes closer to Freud.

                          LEWIS (CONT'D)
                I also think you're terribly
                selfish, putting your own pain
                above the pain of those you love.

                                                              91.

                            LEWIS (CONT'D)
                 You lie to yourself, thinking you
                 can control death like you control
                 your world and your daughter. You
                 believe you can out-think your fear
                 by hiding behind your desk of dead
                 gods, but the truth is that you're
                 terrified.

                           FREUD
                 We all are! And you?! When the
                 siren sounded earlier you didn't
                 behave like a man who "took
                 comfort" this was his last day.
                 WHERE IS YOUR GREAT FAITH? Your
                 precious "Joy" in meeting your
                 maker? It disappears, because you
                 know under all your self-protective
                 lies he does not exist!

      Freud puts his handkerchief to his lips, but doesn't let up.

                           FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
                 YOU BURY YOUR DOUBTS AS YOU DO YOUR
                 MEMORIES OF THE WAR, BECAUSE AT
                 YOUR CORE YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN
                 A COWARD!

      Freud COUGHS, PULLS HIS HANDKERCHIEF AWAY � IT IS SOAKED WITH
      BLOOD.

                           LEWIS
                 Sit down! Here!

      He helps Freud to a chair and runs to the desk.

                           LEWIS (CONT.) (CONT'D)
                 I'll call an ambulance-

      Freud shouts at him, speech thick.

                           FREUD
                 NO! NO HOSPITAL!
                     (Garbled)
                 Towel-

      Lewis, understanding, runs out of the room.


123   INT.   WATER CLOSET                                         123

      Lewis rushes in, looks for towels.
                                                                 92.


124   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                             124

      Freud's choking grows more violent. He shouts through his
      soaked handkerchief.

                             FREUD
                HURRY!


125   INT. HALLWAY                                                   125

      Lewis throws open the door of a tall cabinet � towels.


126   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                             126

      Freud gasps for breath.

      He tries to pull out his prosthesis, with pain. He sucks in
      air, wheezing, both hands in his mouth.

      Lewis runs in with towels.

      Lewis puts one around him as Freud struggles, then steps
      back, helpless.

      Freud ROARS,

                          FREUD
                TAKE IT OUT!

      Lewis, dazed, hesitates.

                          FREUD (CONT'D)
                TAKE IT OUT!!!

      Freud lowers the already soaked towel, opens his mouth as
      wide as he can. He reaches into FREUD'S MOUTH, trying to
      grab the prosthesis with his hand.

      Freud gasps for breath.

      Lewis struggles, tries both hands.

      Finally, as Freud screams in agony, he wrenches it out.

      He cries out, what starts as howling, "AAAA" ends, weakly,
      with "NA".

      BOTH MEN catch their breaths.

                             FREUD (CONT'D)
                Wa..ter.
                                                                93.


      Lewis quickly pours a glass of water from the pitcher on a
      table across the room. He brings it to Freud.

      Surprised, he watches Freud dip the prosthesis in the glass
      of water, rinsing it out. The water becomes red.

      Carefully, wincing all the while, Freud gently re-inserts it.

                          LEWIS
                Would you like to lie down?

      Lewis helps Freud to the couch, assists him in lowering
      himself onto it.

      BOTH MEN are exhausted by the effort and the fright.

                           FREUD
                    (weak)
                The Monster. Nearly won.

      Lewis looks at Freud, eyes closed. This is a man afraid of
      much more than cancer.

                          LEWIS
                What can I do?

                          FREUD (CONT.)
                Go.

                          LEWIS
                Of course not. I'll stay with you
                until someone comes.

                          FREUD
                No-

      Freud coughs, Lewis gives him a fresh towel, he holds it over
      his mouth.

                          LEWIS
                Don't talk.

      Freud removes the towel.

                          FREUD
                You'd. Like. That.


127   SOUND: PLANES IN THE DISTANCE.                             127

      BOTH MEN hear it and freeze.

      The SOUND grows louder as the PLANES come closer.
                                                              94.


                             FREUD
                Bombers?

      Lewis rises, crosses to the DOORS leading out to the GARDEN.


128   EXT. GARDEN TERRACE                                         128

      Lewis emerges from the house, looking up at the sky.


129   THREE PLANES IN FORMATION APPEAR OVER THE HOUSE AND FLY ON.
                                                               129

      Lewis watches with relief.


130   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                          130

      Freud watches Lewis step back inside.

                          LEWIS
                Transport planes. Ours.

      Freud takes this in.

                          FREUD
                I was afraid.

                             LEWIS
                So was I.

                          FREUD
                What were we thinking? It was
                madness to think we could solve the
                greatest mystery of all time.

                          LEWIS
                There's a greater madness. Not to
                think of it at all.

      Freud starts to rise.

                          FREUD
                I will call you a taxi.

                          LEWIS
                No! Sit. I'd rather walk to the
                station. Get some air.

      He picks up a tiny statue on Freud's shelf. It is the Saint
      Freud identified earlier in the church.
                                                     95.


                     LEWIS (CONT'D)
          This looks like the statue we saw
          in Church.

Readies for argument.

                    FREUD
          Yes.

                    LEWIS
          You have a Catholic Saint on your
          shelves?

                    FREUD
          Saint Dymphna of Ireland. She is
          the Patron Saint of the Mad. And
          the lost.

Lewis puts Saint Dymphna back, checking his watch.

                    LEWIS (CONT.)
          There's a train back to Oxford in
          an hour.

Lewis isn't sure what else to say.

                    LEWIS (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

                    FREUD
          The offense was mine.

                    LEWIS
          I didn't say "offense". I said I
          disappointed you.

Freud doesn't follow.

                    LEWIS (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          My idea of God, it constantly
          changes. He shatters it again and
          again. Still, I feel the world is
          crowded with him. He is everywhere.
          Incognito. And His incognito �
          it's so hard to penetrate. The real
          struggle is to keep trying. To come
          awake. And stay awake.

                    FREUD
          One of us is a fool. If you are
          right, you will be able to tell me
          so. If I am right, neither of us
          will ever know.
                    (MORE)
                                                        96.

                    FREUD (CONT'D)
          Death is as unfair as life.
          Goodbye, Professor. We will meet
          again, perhaps.

Lewis takes Freud's outstretched hand.

                    LEWIS
          God willing.

BOTH men smile. Lewis turns to go, and is slightly confused
when he notices the photo on the table from earlier is not of
himself but someone else, who looks similar.

                    FREUD
          Wait-

Freud rises, pulls a book from his desk drawer, then sits.

                    FREUD (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          Do you remember the joke in my book
          about the Pastor and the Village
          atheist?

                    LEWIS
          No.

While he tells his joke, Freud takes a pen and writes in the
book. Lewis glances back at the photo, still shaking it off.

                    FREUD
          The Village Atheist was an
          Insurance Agent. He asked the
          local Pastor if he would make a
          sick call. The Atheist's family was
          astonished. He was on his
          deathbed, they couldn't believe he
          had the strength to speak with the
          Pastor, of all people. All day the
          two men quarreled, then all night.
          Finally, at dawn, the weary Pastor
          stumbled from the house. The
          Villager had died, still an
          atheist. But the Pastor was fully
          insured.

Lewis laughs, Freud is proud of that. He takes the book he's
inscribed and slips it into Lewis' coat pocket.

                    LEWIS
          Now that is funny. If only there
          were such a thing.

                    FREUD
          Humor?
                                                                 97.


                             LEWIS
                Insurance.

      Lewis nods to Freud, almost a small bow. Freud returns it.


131   EXT. FREUD'S HOME � MOMENTS LATER                           131

      Lewis comes down the front steps.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
                PROFESSOR!

      Lewis sees Anna rushing toward him. Exhausted, agitated.

                          LEWIS
                Miss Freud? Are you all right?

                          ANNA
                I have his medicine. I came as fast
                as I could-

                          LEWIS
                    (concerned)
                He's waiting for you, but he's
                fine. Really. No need to worry.

                          ANNA
                I'm so glad you were here. It looks
                like you survived your visit.

                          LEWIS
                    (quoting "Invictus")
                "In the fell clutch of circumstance
                I have not winced nor cried aloud.
                Under the bludgeonings of chance,
                My head is bloody, but unbowed."

                          ANNA
                    (surprises him continuing)
                "Beyond this place of wrath and
                tears, Looms but the Horror of the
                shade, And yet the menace of the
                years Finds, and shall find, me
                unafraid"

                          LEWIS
                    (impressed)
                Cheers to us both.

      Anna returns Lewis' smile.

                          ANNA
                He's waiting for me.
                                                       98.


                    LEWIS
          Of course. A pleasure.

Both start their ways, Anna stops, turns.

                       ANNA
          Professor-

                       LEWIS
          Jack.

                    ANNA
          Jack, may I ask what you talked
          about?

                    LEWIS
          The better question would be, `What
          didn't we?' The world, the war, the
          meaning of it all. Our meaning.

                    ANNA
          Love? Did you talk about love? Not
          sexual, not libidinal or
          instinctual. It's true meaning.

                    LEWIS
          We spoke about God's love.

                    ANNA
          I suppose you need great faith to
          believe in either. Good bye.

A cab has pulled up and Dorothy steps out, excited.

                       DOROTHY
          ANNA!

Anna turns and smiles at seeing her. Lewis watches their joy
in seeing each other and the two embrace. Lewis realizes
their intimacy and looks disappointed, then back at the
house, better understanding better Freud's struggle. Lewis
continues on.

                    DOROTHY (CONT'D)
          Are you certain we should do this?

                    ANNA
          I always looked to someone else for
          answers.
              (stares at her)
          But I've never been more certain.
                                                                99.


132   INT. FREUD'S STUDY                                            132

      Freud opens his desk drawer. He takes out the pill case
      containing the dark pill he took earlier from the medicine
      cabinet - the same pill he had given to Anna in Vienna, when
      she was taken by the Brownshirts.

      Clutching the pills in his hand, he places them back in the
      bathroom, locking them away.

      Freud then turns on the radio, sitting in the nearest chair.

      KING GEORGE'S SPEECH has already begun.

                          KING GEORGE (RADIO)
                This is the ultimate issue which
                confronts us. For the sake of all
                that we ourselves hold dear, and of
                the world order and peace, it is
                unthinkable that we should refuse
                to meet the challenge.


133   INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS                                    133

      Anna opens the front door and enters with Dorothy.

                                                           CUT TO:


134   INT. TRAIN/FREUD'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS                      134

      Lewis settles into a seat of the train car. The train begins
      to move, its clatter getting louder and louder.

      Lewis closes his eyes.

      LEWIS' FANTASY,

      He's back in his toy forest, this time not as a child but as
      a man. He stares ahead into endless, forbidding shadows.

                          KING GEORGE (V.O.)
                There maybe be dark days ahead. And
                war can no longer be confined to
                the battlefield.

                                                           CUT TO:

      C.U. Freud listening to the KING.
                                                                100.


                          KING GEORGE (RADIO)
                But we can only do the right as we
                see the right. And reverently
                commit our cause to God.

      Freud sighs at another "GOD" reference.

                                                        CUT TO:


135   LEWIS,                                                      135

      Seeing a tiny speck of light far ahead, then vanishing.

      Intrigued, his pace quickens. The toy trees he passes become
      real ones.

                                                        CUT TO:


136   FREUD                                                       136

      Leaning back, staring at the ceiling.

      In the hallway outside the study door, Anna and Dorothy
      appear.

                          KING GEORGE (CONT.)
                If one and all we keep resolutely
                faithful to it, ready for whatever
                service or sacrifice it may demand,
                then with God's help we shall
                prevail.

      Anna surprises Dorothy by taking her hand.

                                                        CUT TO:


137   FREUD                                                       137

      Opening his hand and seeing the pill he holds.

                           BBC ANNOUNCER (CONT.)
                We will return to the BBC
                Orchestra, featuring tonight, on
                their musical program, Percy
                Whitlock's "Battle of the Wood
                Creatures"

      Freud rises, reaches for the dial to turn the radio off as
      the music begins. And hesitates.

      He turns the music up.
                                                               101.


      Movement catches his eye:

      He turn to see Anna and Dorothy enter. They stop. Anna takes
      Dorothy's hand in hers.

      For a moment, Father and Daughter stare at each other.

      Saying nothing, Freud goes back to his chair beside the
      radio, surreptitiously slipping the "suicide" pill into his
      pocket, then half-turns, waving them nearer.

      Anna and Dorothy walk slowly across the study, passing rows
      of Gods watching them.

      Freud doesn't move from the radio as Anna and Dorothy sit
      close to him.

      MUSIC swells - Anna looks to her Father, surprised to see him
      listening to music. He turns, meets her eyes.

      Freud then stares at the radio, listening intently, trying to
      decipher what he should feel.

                                                        CUT TO:


138   LEWIS                                                       138

      The FOREST is golden now, shimmering between reality and
      fantasy.

      The brightness of the single beam of light stops him.

      He shields his eyes, trying to see-

      His expression changes, astonishment, awe, at what he-

                                                        CUT TO:


139   THE TRAIN                                                   139

      Its brakes scream as the train slows.

      Lewis, jolted, opens his eyes as the gas mask bag on his lap
      falls to the floor.

      Reaching down for the bag, he feels the book in his pocket
      Freud gave him.

      The train slowly picks up speed.

      Lewis looks at the book: it is his own, a copy of "PILGRIM'S
      REGRESS".
                                                                102.


      Freud had read it after all.

      Lewis opens the book to see what Freud had written inside:

      "FROM ERROR TO ERROR, ONE DISCOVERS THE ENTIRE TRUTH".

      Signed, Sigmund Freud.

      Lewis reads it and smiles as the train enters a tunnel.

                                                      FADE OUT.
