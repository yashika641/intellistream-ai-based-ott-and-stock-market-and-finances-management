    INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

    CARLA NOWAK (29) is holding a telephone receiver to her ear �
    the teachers' lounge is a place where people still use
    landlines. The conversation has been going on for some time.
    Carla glances at her watch.

                        CARLA
              Yes, I understand. Like I said, we
              went over this last week...

    The person on the other end interrupts her. Carla listens
    patiently.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              One second.

    She grabs a pen, searching for paper to no avail.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Yes, I'm still here.

    She writes a number and an address on her palm.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Yes... 0153... 4, yes...

    A colleague, MILOSZ DUDEK (45), appears in the background,
    giving Carla the sign that it's time. She nods and he starts
    off without her.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Yes, you'll hear from me. I've
              taken a note and will look into it.
              Great. Bye.

    She hangs up, hurriedly packs her stuff away, then heads
    off...

2                                                                 2
    INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

    ... down long corridors. She reaches a classroom door, takes
    a deep breath, and enters.

3                                                                 3
    INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

    Carla enters a plain room of the kind we're all familiar with
    from school days. A couple of tables have been pushed
    together, and at the end of this arrangement sit JENNY (12)
    and LUKAS (12).

    Opposite them, teachers Milosz Dudek and THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
    (42) have taken their seats.

    Lukas is silently looking at the cap he has placed on his
    lap. Jenny, the textbook teenager, has long hair and braces.
                                                         2.


The mood is tense as Carla sits down between the two parties
on the long side of the table.

                    CARLA
          Sorry I'm late.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          It's fine. Mr. Liebenwerda has
          given us the essentials.

                    CARLA
          Good.
              (to the children)
          So you know know what happened.

Lukas nods.

                    JENNY
          Yeah, but we told them we don't
          know anything.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          You may not know anything for
          certain, but do you have any leads?

Jenny and Lukas look at each other � la search me.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Have you seen anything unusual
          recently? Students acting strange?

Jenny looks at Lukas, who shrugs.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          I know this is unpleasant for you.

                    CARLA
          And not just for you.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          But put yourselves in the victims'
          shoes. We need to put a stop to
          this. And you two are class
          representatives.

                    JENNY
          But what can we say if we don't
          know anything?

Lukas continues to retreat into himself, staring at the
floor. Carla looks at Thomas, her gaze eloquent: Just leave
it.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Lukas?

Lukas looks up.
                                                            3.


                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          Does no one spring to mind? Someone
          with a new smartphone, expensive
          clothes or loads of cash?

                    LUKAS
          I don't wanna talk about it.

The teachers look at Lukas. Jenny turns to him in confusion.

                       JENNY
                 (softly)
          Hey.

                    CARLA
          Then you don't have to, Lukas.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          That's right. We don't have to talk
          at all.

Thomas Liebenwerda gets up and goes to the other side of the
table. He places the register in which all the names of the
children in 7B are listed in front of Lukas.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          I'll go down this list with my pen
          and all you need to do is nod if
          you harbor suspicions.

Liebenwerda starts to run his pen down the list of names.
Lukas is looking at it and repeatedly shaking his head.

Milosz Dudek and Carla eye each other � Liebenwerda's method
hadn't been agreed upon.

                    CARLA
          Mr. Liebenwerda?

She looks at him: Shall we stop this?

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Of course you don't have to if you
          don't want to.

Lukas barely reacts.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          But I suggest we continue. We're
          almost done.

Lukas gives a shrug. Liebenwerda starts once again.

We remain on Carla: The events around her are reflected in
her face - a face which, by degrees, is growing stony.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          This kid? Him? Thanks, Lukas.
                                                              4.


                        MILOSZ DUDEK (O.S.)
              I'd like to remind you that you're
              to keep what we've discussed to
              yourselves.

    The children nod half-heartedly, but Carla is barely aware of
    what's going on around her now. She only knows that what just
    happened was not okay. But the bell for the next lesson is
    already ringing.

                                                      CUT TO:

    TITLE: THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE

                        CARLA (PRE-LAP)
              Good day, dear class.

4                                                                  4
    INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

                        CLASS
                  (in chorus)
              Good morning, good, good, good morn-
              ing, morn-ing...

    Carla is standing at the blackboard with class 7B in front of
    her and completing a ritual greeting of clapping, patting and
    finger-clicking to the words they repeat.

                        CARLA
              I see the books.

    The children hold their math books up in the air. Carla
    checks to see if anyone has forgotten theirs.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              I see the files and notebooks.

    The children hold up their files and notebooks.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Great. Then put out your homework,
              I'll come around. In the interim,
              look at the warm-up in silence.

    She points to the blackboard. It reads:

    WARM-UP: 0.999... = 1? PROOF!!!

    Carla walks down the rows and checks the homework while the
    children attempt the warm-up � among the kids are Jenny and
    Lukas. She offers attention to the students, makes comments,
    praises and offers constructive criticism.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Good... Yes, good. Ali... Take
              another look at exercise two.
                        (MORE)
                                                          5.
                    CARLA (CONT'D)
              (to another student)
          Can you explain it to him?

She walks on, bending over another group.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          You need the same denominator so
          you can add them together.

The class grows too loud.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Hey!

She claps her hands four times. The class takes the prompt
and claps back twice - silence.

Carla returns to the front.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Okay, who wants to solve the warm-
          up? Is 0.999 the same as 1?

HATICE (12), a girl in a headscarf, holds up a hand.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Yes, Hatice?

                    HATICE
          It's actually not the same.

                    CARLA
          Actually? Please come up to the
          board and show us why not.

Hatice approaches the board and starts providing proof.

                    HATICE
          Well, if you subtract 0.999 from 1,
          there's still a remainder. Of 0.000
          and then a 1.

She writes her deductions on the board.

                    CARLA
          So you think there's a number
          between 0.999 and 1?

                    HATICE
          Yeah.

                    CARLA
              (to the class)
          So, is this proof or an assumption?

                    JENNY
          That's not really proof, is it?
                                                           6.


Carla looks at the class. Oskar holds up a hand.

                    CARLA
          Okay. Oskar wants a try. Thanks,
          Hatice.

Hatice sits back down and Oskar approaches the board. He
writes quickly and without much by way of explanation.

                    OSKAR
          Alright, 0.1111 is equal to one
          ninth.

He writes on the blackboard: 0.11... = 1/9

                    OSKAR (CONT'D)
          And nine times one ninth equals 1.

9 x 1/9 = 1

                    OSKAR (CONT'D)
          So 0.999 equals 1.

0,999... = 1

He stands shyly beside the blackboard. Carla tries to conceal
her enthusiasm.

                    CARLA
              (to the class)
          What do you all say?

Carla sees that some of the children don't quite follow.

                    JENNY
          Makes sense.

                    CARLA
          Makes sense, doesn't it? Hatice?

                    HATICE
          I still don't really get it.

                    TOM
              (calling out)
          There must be a gap between nine
          and one.

TOM (12) is a big kid with a loud voice.

Oskar is still at the blackboard. Carla looks at him
questioningly. He shrugs and returns to his seat.

                    CARLA
          Thanks, Oskar. Does anyone else not
          understand?

The majority of the children raise their hands.
                                                         7.


                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Right, well it was complex. But the
          crucial thing to understand is that
          a proof needs a derivation that
          builds up step by step. We'll get
          there, don't worry.

There's a knock at the door.

                     CARLA (CONT'D)
          Come in.

But the door has opened even before Carla has spoken.

The principal, DR. BETTINA B�HM (64), Thomas Liebenwerda and
Milosz Dudek enter. One can see how long the principal has
been in the profession � her every breath shows how versed
she is in such situations.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Sorry to disturb you. If I might.

She turns to address the class.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          Hello, everyone. We have to
          interrupt briefly. Mr. Dudek?

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          Would the girls please stand up and
          leave the room?

The girls look at each other. The first ones stand up.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK (CONT'D)
          Go on and wait outside. We'll bring
          you back in shortly. Close the
          door.

The girls do so.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Right. The rest of you: Listen up.
          Take out your wallets, put them on
          your desks and come up front.

The boys look at each other perplexedly. Carla doesn't
understand what's going on, either.

Dissenting voices can be heard.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          It's voluntary, of course. But if
          you've got nothing to hide, you've
          got nothing to fear.

The children do as the principal tells them. One by one, the
boys take out their wallets and place them on their desks.
                                                         8.


                     CARLA
               (whispering to Dr. B�hm)
           Excuse me, but what is this?

                     DR. BETTINA B�HM
               (whispering back)
           Weren't you there when they were
           questioned?

While the boys make their way up to the blackboard, the other
teachers check the wallets � they look inside them, and if
the contents are inconspicuous, return them to their place.

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
           Who sits here?

                        LUKAS
           Oskar.

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
           Oskar, where's your wallet?

                     OSKAR
           I don't have one.

                     CARLA
           You don't have to show it.

                     OSKAR
           I just said I don't have one!

                     MILOSZ DUDEK
           And this one?

He holds up a wallet.

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
           Guys, whose seat is this?

Silence.

                        DR. BETTINA B�HM
           Ms. Nowak?

                     CARLA
           It's... Ali's.

All eyes are on ALI (12) � fear is writ large in his face.
Carla looks at Lukas, who averts his gaze.

                     MILOSZ DUDEK
           Ali, come with me, please.
                                                              9.

5                                                                  5
    INT. OFFICE B�HM - DAY

    Ali's parents have come to the school and are sitting beside
    their son, who endures the silence. Dr. B�hm and Carla are
    seated across from them.

                        ALI'S MOTHER
              I gave him the money this morning
              so he could buy a gift later for
              his cousin.

                        DR. BETTINA B�HM
              Might I ask what he was going to
              buy?

                        ALI'S MOTHER
              I think it was a computer game.
              Right? Ali, konusana.

                        ALI
              Yeah, a computer game.

                        CARLA
              Well, dear Ali, Mr. and Mrs.
              Yilmaz, I think that clears things
              up. Let's put this behind us.

    Carla looks over at Dr. B�hm, who gives a fleeting nod.

                        MOTHER OF ALI
              What gave you the idea?

                        CARLA
              Sorry?

                        MOTHER OF ALI
              Why my Ali?

                        DR. BETTINA B�HM
              He had an unusual amount of money.

                        MOTHER OF ALI
              So? What if a mother likes to put
              money in her kid's pockets?

                        CARLA
              Yeah.

                        DR. BETTINA B�HM
              Ms. Yilmaz--

                        MOTHER OF ALI
              Carrying money isn't a crime.

                        CARLA
              True.
                                      10.


          DR. BETTINA B�HM
We have a zero tolerance policy,
which means we look into every
matter, no matter how small.

          MOTHER OF ALI
But what will the other kids think
of him now? You know how children
are.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Don't worry, Mrs. Yilmaz. We'll set
it right.

          MOTHER OF ALI
Set it right?

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Yeah. We're lucky the suspicion
didn't prove true or this would be
much graver.

          CARLA
Sorry you had to come in.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Yes, we're sorry.

          FATHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish to his wife)
You dragged me in here for this
shit?

          MOTHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish)
It's important.

          FATHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish)
So important that they're sending
us back home again?

          MOTHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish)
Don't make a scene.

          FATHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish)
Then you try explaining to my boss
why I had to leave mid-shift.

          MOTHER OF ALI
    (in Turkish)
This is about our son, Hikmet. They
asked to see both of us.
                                                            11.


                        FATHER OF ALI
                  (in Turkish)
              Like you couldn't take care of this
              bullshit on your own.

    Dr. B�hm clears his throat.

                        DR. BETTINA B�HM
              Might I ask you to please speak
              German?

                        FATHER OF ALI
                  (in unaccented German)
              Right, German it is. My son doesn't
              steal. Ever. And if he did, I'd
              break his legs.

    The teachers hadn't been expecting this. Ali's father summons
    his son and they depart.

6                                                                 6
    INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

    A number of colleagues have gathered. Besides Thomas
    Liebenwerda and Milosz Dudek, there's also LORE SEMNIK (49),
    a sharp-eyed teacher of German and music who's objective in
    her dealings and a guidance counselor.

    Beside them is also VANESSA K�NIG (42), an attractive French
    teacher in eye-catching, patterned pantyhose and with a
    foible for self-dramatization.

    In the kitchenette, Carla pours filter coffee into her cup
    and puts fifty cents into the piggy-bank while listening.

                        THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              ... That's just the way it is. The
              children don't have anyone at home
              they deem worthy of respect.

                        MILOSZ DUDEK
              And this is why we have to be
              tough?

                        THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              Those were your words.

                        MILOSZ DUDEK
              But you implied it.

                        THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              All I'm saying is, we can't let
              them walk all over us.

                        LORE SEMNIK
              And who, precisely, is walking all
              over you, Thomas?
                                                           12.


Ms. Kuhn is filing pieces of paper at the pigeonholes. Carla
walks past her.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Ms. Nowak? The substitute teacher
          plan is in your pigeonhole. Ms.
          Holbach is on sick leave until next
          week.

                    CARLA
          I saw, thanks.

Ms. Kuhn carries on at the pigeonholes, then goes back into
the office. Carla sits down with the group, whose discussion
has progressed.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          That's what we're trying to figure
          out.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          But not like this. Think about what
          it does to children when they're
          frisked in class.

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          No one got frisked. It was
          voluntary.

                    CARLA
          You know perfectly well it wasn't
          voluntary. A heads-up would've been
          cordial.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          You don't know how long this has
          been going on. Kids here steal all
          the time. We need to act when we
          have the chance.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Did those pencils ever reappear?

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          No.

Dudek chews on a breakfast roll that he washes down with
tepid filter coffee. Carla packs her things.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          A thousand pencils. Who needs a
          thousand pencils? Can anyone
          explain that to me?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          I still say it started when we got
          the new cleaning company.
                                                            13.


                        LORE SEMNIK
              Watch what you say, Vanessa. Those
              women are really nice.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
                  (half-joking)
              How about we hire a private
              detective?

                        LORE SEMNIK
              Right, some guy lurking about the
              school yard smoking a pipe.

                        THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              Like in stores.

                         CARLA
              I'm off.

                        VANESSA K�NIG
              There's no budget for that.

                        CARLA
              We need to act. Right, Mr.
              Liebenwerda?

    She exits, her jacket still hanging from her chair.

7                                                                 7
    INT. GYM - DAY

    SLO-MO: The students run in a circle, their knees high. At
    its center, in her sports gear, is Carla, a whistle dangling
    from her neck. With hands and feet, she has the children
    adopt her rhythm.

8                                                                 8
    INT. GYM - LATER - DAY

    The children are lying on their stomachs in a circle with
    Carla in the middle.

                        CARLA
              On three, we raise our arms and
              legs: one, two, three!

    Carla does so, as do the children.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              And those who can, or want to, can
              shake them.

    LATER, the children are divided into two teams, one wearing
    red straps and playing basketball.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Go on, Enno. Nice dribbling.
                                                          14.


JIEUN (12) and LUISE (12) are sitting on a bench. At first
glance, Jieun could pass for a boy. Luise is delicate with
pale skin, freckles and red hair. Both aren't taking part in
the gym class.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          You two okay?

They whisper to each other, giggle, and exit when Carla is
distracted.

Lukas fouls Ali and they both go down. Carla blows her
whistle.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Hey, keep it clean!

                    ALI
          But Ms. Nowak!

                    CARLA
          Ali, get up. It happens.

He points behind her.

                    ALI
          I've had it. Luise and Jieun do
          whatever they want.

Carla notices that Jieun and Luise are gone. She looks around
the hall, but no sign of them. The door to the gym stands
ajar.

                    CARLA
          Calm down and play on, Ali. It
          wasn't that bad. Come on.

She goes over to the other end of the gym.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
              (to Jenny)
          Jenny, can you check on Jieun and
          Luise?

Jenny skips off. The game continues while Carla's eyes again
wander to the door: Where are they?

It seems like an eternity until she turns to one of the
children on the bench.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Ruben, come here. Take over as ref.
          I'll be right back.

She gives the boy the whistle and exits.
                                                            15.

9                                                                 9
    INT. GYM HALLWAY - DAY

    Carla walks through the empty gym hallway.

                        CARLA
              Jieun? Luise?

    No answer. The hallway is in darkness. The shrieking of the
    children echoes out from the gym. Carla walks outside, where
    the girls are sitting. Carla sees Luise hide something
    between her legs.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Are you coming back in?

                         LUISE
              Sorry, Ms. Nowak, we needed some
              fresh air.

                        CARLA
              Show me what you hid between your
              legs.

                         LUISE
              Nothing.

                        CARLA
              Come on, show me.

    Luise opens her palm: a fancy Zippo. Carla takes it from her.

                        CARLA (CONT'D)
              Were you smoking?

                         LUISE
              Not us.

                        CARLA
              So why the lighter?

                        JIEUN
              To cook heroin.

    Luise and Jenny giggle.

                        CARLA
              Jieun, that's not funny.

                        JIEUN
              I think it is.

                        CARLA
              You said you were sick. I believed
              you.

                        JIEUN
                  (interrupting)
              We needed fresh air.
                                                              16.


                            JENNY
               It's true.

                            CARLA
               In you go.

     She indicates the direction.

                         LUISE
               What about my lighter?

                         CARLA
               I'm keeping it for now.

                         LUISE
               For how long?

                         CARLA
               Until I've spoken to your parents.

                         LUISE
               Please don't do that.

     Luise has fear in her face.

                         LUISE (CONT'D)
               It's a gift for my father. It's his
               birthday tomorrow.

     Is she lying? Carla hesitates.

                         CARLA
               Fine. But next time, tell me before
               you leave the hall, got it?

                         LUISE
               And the lighter?

                            CARLA
               Got it?

                            LUISE
               I get it.

                         JIEUN
               Yes, Ms. Nowak.

                         CARLA
               Fine. Pick up your lighter at the
               end of the day. Now in you go.

     The girls go into the hall, Carla glancing after them.

10                                                              10
     INT. ADMIN OFFICE - DAY

     Carla enters the admin office Oskar is just exiting.
                                                        17.


                       CARLA
          Hey Oskar!

He smiles thinly, walking past her without a word.

Ms. Kuhn is sitting behind the counter with a second
secretary, a young trainee called MARIAM (23).

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Hello, this was in the gym - and
          isn't one of my students'. The
          diary of some Steffi. No last name.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          A diary? Did you read it?

                       CARLA
          I'd never.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Cross your heart? Nor would I.

Ms. Kuhn takes out a box marked Lost & Found and puts the
book inside.

                    CARLA
          I was still having trouble with my
          email account yesterday.

                       FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Uh-huh?

                    CARLA
          Could you check my login with IT?

A phone rings. Mariam answers it.

                    MARIAM (O.S.)
          Hello, Emmy N�ther High... Sick? Oh
          dear. Get well soon. I'll pass it
          on... Sure...

MITRA (16) and KRISSI (16), two seniors, enter the office.

                    MITRA
          Ms. Kuhn, I need a sanitary
          product. It's kind of urgent.

Ms. Kuhn goes to a first aid cabinet.

                       FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          T or N?

                       MITRA
          T, please.
                                                             18.


                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
                   (to Krissi)
               And you?

                           KRISSI
               I'm good.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
                   (to Mitra)
               How many?

                         MITRA
               Two. Thanks, Bye.

                           FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Bye.

                           CARLA
               Ms. Kuhn?

                           FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Yes?

                         CARLA
               My login details?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Like I said, sorry, but I can't.

                           CARLA
               Why not?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Because Mariam already did. It's in
               your pigeonhole.

                         CARLA
               You're great. Thanks.

                           MARIAM
               Sorry?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               You're great.

     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla enters. One of her colleagues is unobserved in the
     kitchenette; she has just poured herself a cup of coffee and
     has a hand on the piggy bank. But instead of putting
     something in the kitty, she seems to remove a bill and pocket
     it. Carla watches as she goes over to a seat. The colleague
     glances back towards her.
                                                                19.

12                                                                12
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     The class is taking a test. Carla goes through the registry.
     She glances around the class. All, as yet, are engrossed in
     their work.

     Oskar gets up and places his test on the teacher's desk.

                         CARLA
                   (quietly)
               You're already done?

     Oskar nods.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Don't you want to double-check your
               answers?

                         OSKAR
               Can I go outside?

     Carla nods.

                         CARLA
               But keep quiet.

     Oskar nods and exits.

     There's a rustling. Carla turns and sees Tom playing with
     some papers. She approaches and reaches for the cheat sheet.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
                   (in disappointment)
               Oh, Tom.

                         TOM
               It's not mine.

                         CARLA
               It's your handwriting, of course it
               is. Give me the test.

                            TOM
               No.

                            CARLA
               Please.

                            TOM
               No.

                         ALI
               It's not his.

                         CARLA
               Ali, I'm talking to Tom. Be quiet.

     Turning to Tom.
                                                             20.


                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Give it to me.

                            TOM
               No.

                            CARLA
               Tom!

     He reluctantly hands it to her.

     Students turn around as the class grows restless. Carla takes
     a fresh sheet from her desk and goes back to Tom.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
                   (quietly)
               Start over again. You have 20
               minutes.

     Tom doesn't take the paper.

                         TOM
               What use is that?

                         CARLA
               Either try again or fail for
               cheating.

                         TOM
                   (loudly)
               It wasn't mine.

                         CARLA
               Tom, no discussion.

     She holds the sheet out to him once again. Tom reluctantly
     starts writing his test again.

13                                                                13
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     The school bell rings. Children hand in their tests and exit.
     Only Tom and two others still write.

                         CARLA
               Pens down and bring your tests up
               front.

     The children do so.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Tom, one moment, please.

     Tom and Lukas exchange glances. Lukas holds a basketball.

                         LUKAS
               I'll be outside.
                                               21.


                    CARLA
          Well, Tom, I don't approve of your
          behavior.

                    TOM
          What did I do?

                    CARLA
          First you cheated, then you argued
          with me and distracted your fellow
          students.

Tom avoids her gaze.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          I looked at your cheat sheet. When
          you make a cheat sheet, at least
          get the stuff right. You made the
          same errors on your test, then
          claimed it's not your sheet? How
          would you feel if I lied to you?

Tom shrugs.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Not cool, right?

Beat.

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
          Tom.

                    TOM
          What am I to say?

                    CARLA
          I want you to understand that your
          behavior isn't fair to the others.
          The rules apply to everyone. Got
          it? You got it, Tom?

                    TOM
              (mumbling)
          Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

                    CARLA
          Anything to add?

                       TOM
          Sorry.

                    CARLA
              (confirming)
          "Sorry."

                    TOM
          Isn't that what you want to hear?
          Can I go now?
                                                               22.


                         CARLA
               Yes, you may.

14                                                               14
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla is in a corner skyping with an English colleague.

                         CARLA
                   (in English)
               We'll let the parents know.

                         TIM (VIA SKYPE)
                   (in English)
               Alright, great. When do you think
               you'll have a list of the
               participants?

                         CARLA
                   (in English)
               I hope to have it by the end of
               next month. Is that good for you?

                         TIM (VIA SKYPE)
                   (in English)
               Sure. We still have more than
               enough time.

     Carla's line of thought is interrupted when Vanessa K�nig
     approaches.

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               Your next period's in the gym,
               right?

                            CARLA
               Yeah.

                          VANESSA K�NIG
               Sorry, I wanted to ask if we can
               discuss one of your students, it's
               important.

                            CARLA
               Of course.

                            VANESSA K�NIG
               It's Ali.

                         CARLA
               What is it this time?

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               He barely passed last semester.
               He'll flunk if he doesn't improve.

                            CARLA
               Oh.
                                                        23.


Thomas Liebenwerda joins them.

                       THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Morning.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          We're discussing Ali, Thomas.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Oh, tricky.

                    CARLA
          Tricky? Why?

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Just tricky. In danger of flunking.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Absolutely.

                    CARLA
          One second.
              (stressed, in English,
               into the laptop)
          Tim, we're going to have to catch
          up some other time. I'm sorry, I
          have to go.

Tim says his goodbyes, largely unregarded by Carla, whose
attention is now on Ali.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
              (to Thomas)
          Is it his oral exam?

                       THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          That, too.

She shuts the Skype app.

                    CARLA
          The semester only just began. He
          might still make it. Have you
          spoken to his parents?

                       VANESSA K�NIG
          Not yet.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Do you know what their professions
          are?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          I think his father drives a cab.

                    CARLA
          How is that relevant?
                                                           24.


                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA.
          Maybe no one's at home to help him
          study.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Did you believe them?

                    CARLA
          The parents?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Yeah.

                    CARLA
          Is this about Ali's grades or the
          theft?

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Nonsense, it's not about that. That
          doesn't matter.

                    CARLA
          Right. But to answer your question,
          Vanessa, I believe the parents. I
          believe they have integrity and
          that Ali didn't steal.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          It was a question, Carla. A simple
          question.

Carla's look: Don't go asking such dumb shit.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Calm down, Vanessa.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Everyone's so uptight. Thanks a
          lot, Carla.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Let's get back to work.

General dismay. Vanessa and Thomas leave. Carla watches them
go, anger writ large in her face � and not letting up.

She watches her colleagues before her gaze falls on her
laptop again. She opens her webcam image in a small window
and slides her computer slightly to the right, thus observing
what is happening behind her.

She takes her wallet from her bag and glances inside: 50
euros in small bills fresh from the ATM.

She puts the wallet in her jacket pocket, then pulls it back
out a little so it's visible to a potential thief. She hangs
the jacket over the chair.
                                                               25.


     Carla sits back down at the laptop, the jacket on the chair
     is visible via the webcam. She presses the red RECORD button
     on the app, then minimizes the window and takes the laptop
     lock from her pocket. She attaches the computer to the
     table's leg and stands up.

     Before she leaves, Carla glances at the computer one last
     time: Her screensaver is of a hammock hanging on a heavenly
     white beach.

15                                                               15
     INT. GYM/TEACHERS' CHANGING ROOM - DAY

     Carla is standing in the teachers' changing room.

     She pulls up the blinds. The view behind the glass is that of
     the gym, into which the first of the children are now
     running. Carla takes a sip of her water and hearkens in the
     silence. She switches off the light before leaving the room.
     The children's muted voices can be heard.

16                                                               16
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla is back in the teachers' lounge. There are only a few
     teachers there. Her laptop is still where it was. The first
     thing she does is to shut it.

     Then she   goes over to her jacket and checks her wallet,
     counting   the bills. It's soon clear: Some of the money is
     missing.   The perpetrator has struck again. She nervously puts
     away her   wallet.

     She takes her laptop and angles it surreptitiously. She loads
     the video and presses PLAY. Nothing happens for a while. She
     fast-forwards. Colleagues speed past, but her jacket remains
     untouched.

                             MILOSZ DUDEK (O.S.)
                 Hey.

     Startled, Carla shuts the laptop. Milosz is standing beside
     her. Did he see any of this?

                             CARLA
                 Hey.

                           MILOSZ DUDEK
                 I just wanted to say I'm sorry
                 about yesterday.

                             CARLA
                 For what?

                           MILOSZ DUDEK
                     (in Polish)
                 Frisking your class was not
                 alright.
                                                             26.


                         CARLA
                   (in German)
               It's okay. Forget about it.

     She smiles at him. Is there anything else? Milosz considers,
     but Carla beats him to it.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               And do me a favor: Let's talk
               German at work, please.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               Why? Are you ashamed?

                         CARLA
               Because of our colleagues.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               Fine, why not?

     They look at each other uneasily.

                         CARLA
               Thanks.

     She takes the laptop and leaves the teachers' lounge, going
     into the...

17                                                             17
     INT. REST ROOMS - DAY

     Carla locks herself in a cubicle.

     She sits down on the lid, flips open the display and presses
     PLAY again.

     Again, we see only her jacket. People cross the lounge - but
     no one touches it.

     A spellbound Carla finally comes upon the moment: Someone
     approaches her jacket and tampers with it, but the shot cuts
     the person off at the neck. Carla can't tell who the person
     is. All she can make out is a light blouse patterned with
     small yellow stars. She once again views the instant of the
     theft and zooms in: an arm, a pattern. With that, she goes
     back into the hallway.

18                                                             18
     INT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla exits approaches the teachers' lounge. Some of her
     colleagues walk in her direction. Carla examines them as she
     passes: a white shirt, a gray sweater, a mustard-yellow
     waistcoat...
                                                             27.

19                                                               19
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla enters and examines her colleagues' clothing. Here,
     again, there's no one in comparable dress.

     Then she notices Ms. Kuhn beyond the glass window of the
     admin office. The secretary is in conversation with Mr.
     Stahlmann (59) and is wearing a blouse with little yellow
     stars on it.

20                                                               20
     INT. ADMIN OFFICE - DAY

     Carla is by the door, waiting because Mr. Stahlmann is still
     talking to Ms. Kuhn.

                         STAHLMANN
               ... oh, and, Ms. Kuhn, the printers
               are on strike again.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Again? Sounds like the union to me.

                            STAHLMANN
               Paper jam.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Try the flap on the side.

                         STAHLMANN
               I'm useless with these things.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               It's usually stuck there.

                         STAHLMANN
               I have class and you're faster.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
                   (interrupts)
               We'll look into it when we have a
               second.

                            STAHLMANN
               Thanks.

     Kuhn nods meaningfully. Stahlmann exits.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               He doesn't want to fix it. He wants
               us to.

     Carla enters, her laptop protecting her chest.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               Ms. Nowak. How can we help?

     Carla hesitates.
                                                        28.


                    CARLA
          I have a huge problem, Ms. Kuhn.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          What can we do for you?

                    CARLA
          How do I put this nicely?

Carla breaks off and turns to Mariam, who's working on email.

                     CARLA (CONT'D)
              (to Mariam)
          Excuse me, may Ms. Kuhn and I speak
          privately?

Confused looks.

                    MARIAM
          Sure. You want me to leave?

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Mariam, take a look at the printer.
          A physics degree obviously isn't
          enough to solve the problem.

Mariam exits. Carla closes the door. Now it's a t�te-�-t�te.
Ms. Kuhn's smile gives way to a serious expression.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
          You wanna sit down?

                    CARLA
          No, thanks. So, Ms. Kuhn, I was in
          gym class and my jacket was hanging
          in the teachers' lounge.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          A-ha. And what's with the jacket?

                    CARLA
          The jacket's still there.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          So what's the problem?

                    CARLA
          My wallet was inside the jacket,
          and inside the jacket there was...

Carla makes a gesture that prompts Ms. Kuhn to complete the
sentence.

                       FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          ... money?

                    CARLA
          That's right. WAS.
                                                        29.


                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          You mean someone from the
          faculty...?

                    CARLA
          What makes you say faculty?

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Well, the jacket was in the
          teachers' lounge, so it couldn't
          have been students.

A MESSENGER comes in. Kuhn signs for the package.

                     FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
          So who was there?
              (to the messenger)
          Thank you.

The messenger exits.

                     FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
          Liebenwerda. Ms. Semnik. I wasn't
          here the whole time, so... Mariam,
          of course.

                    CARLA
          Liebenwerda, Semnik, Ms. Irfan...
          Can you imagine they did it?

Ms. Kuhn shrugs, her look reading: I can imagine many things.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Ms. Kuhn... Do you have something
          to say?

                       FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Like what?

                    CARLA
          Your blouse, I've never seen it
          before.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          My blouse? What about my blouse?

                    CARLA
          Ms. Kuhn, this is very unpleasant
          for me, but there are indications
          that you did it.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          I did what. You're kidding.
                                                              30.


                          CARLA
               I don't want this to make waves.
               Return the money, promise this will
               stop, and we'll forget it here and
               now, okay?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               You mean this for real?

                         CARLA
               Think of it as a chance to be done
               with this and we'll never mention
               it again.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
                   (interrupting)
               A chance? This is an outrage.
               Please leave now! Leave!

     The laptop under her arm, Carla exits.

21                                                                21
     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Carla enters the corridor, where Mariam stands in front of
     the door.

                         MARIAM
               Can I go back in?

     Carla can't answer; she turns away, suppressing bitter
     laughter at Ms. Kuhn's audacity.

     She goes into the...

22                                                                22
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     ... and reflects before coming to a decision.

23                                                                23
     INT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF OFFICE B�HM - DAY

     Carla makes for the door to Dr. B�hm's office. She hesitates
     before entering.

24                                                                24
     INT. OFFICE B�HM - DAY

     Carla stands in Dr. B�hm's office, not knowing what to do.

                         CARLA
               Can I show you something?

     She holds up her laptop.
                                                             31.

25                                                             25
     INT. OFFICE B�HM - DAY

     While Carla is still waiting in Dr. B�hm's office, the latter
     steps out into the hallway. Carla is plainly dismayed. She
     watches Dr. B�hm enter the admin office and talk to Ms. Kuhn.
     Oskar, Ms. Kuhn's son, is there waiting for his mother to
     finish work.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Ms. Kuhn, please stop what you're
               doing and come to my office.

     Ms. Kuhn rises and follows Dr. B�hm.

                         OSKAR
               Mama, have you eaten yet?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               No, we'll eat together. Wait for
               me.

                         OSKAR
               But hurry, I'm starving.

     Dr. B�hm and Ms. Kuhn enter the office and Dr. B�hm shuts the
     door. A brief gaze passes between Carla and Oskar as the door
     closes.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
                   (to Kuhn)
               Please have a seat.

     Ms. Kuhn sits down on one of the two chairs facing Dr. B�hm's
     desk. She doesn't deign to give Carla a glance.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
               Ms. Kuhn, you can guess what this
               is about. Do you have something to
               tell us?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               This allegation is totally
               impertinent.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               All right, but we have a problem
               and need to talk about it. It's not
               yet an allegation.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Yes, it is. I mean, do you have
               proof?

     Carla and B�hm exchange glances.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Hand it over, Ms. Nowak.
                                                        32.


Dr. B�hm turns the laptop to Friederike Kuhn and shows her
the relevant footage. Carla tries to read Ms. Kuhn's
expression. As the arm comes into shot, B�hm pauses the
video.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          Knowing you, Ms. Kuhn, I can't
          believe what I'm seeing here.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          This is your proof? You can't
          recognize anyone.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          It's your blouse.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Yeah?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          And what about the pattern?

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          Are you kidding me?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          If I'm not mistaken, it's the
          blouse you're wearing right now.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          And none of the 70 people who come
          in and out wear a similar blouse?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Fifty percent of those people are
          men, so they don't wear blouses,
          and the other fifty percent were in
          class or are sick.

Dr. B�hm shuts the laptop - end of discussion.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          If we can't find a common solution,
          I'll have to report what happened.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN
          What kind of solution?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          A common solution.

B�hm looks both Carla and Kuhn in the face.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          As a start, you could give Ms.
          Nowak back her money.
                                                                33.


                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               So you've already made up your
               mind.

     Ms. Kuhn is fighting back the tears. She takes her wallet and
     casts it on the desk.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               Here you go.

     Dr. B�hm hands it back to her.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               There, take it!

     Ms. Kuhn rummages through it, but it's empty.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               As luck would have it, I have to go
               to the ATM because I have no money
               at all. Or is there anything that
               belongs to you here? Please, take
               it. Or do you wanna frisk me?

     She turns out her pockets.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               Here! This is part of our daily
               routine now.

     She abruptly leaves the room. Carla follows her.

26                                                                26
     INT. ADMIN OFFICE/CORRIDOR - DAY

     Carla hurries after Ms. Kuhn and sees her hastily packing her
     things, Oskar standing awkwardly beside her.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
                   (moving towards her)
               You okay?

                           CARLA
               Hang on.

     As Carla approaches, Kuhn throws on her jacket and grabs
     Oskar by the shoulder.

                         OSKAR
               Mama, what's wrong?

                           FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Nothing.

                           CARLA
               Ms. Kuhn?
                                                              34.


     Kuhn drags Oskar out of the room. The two of them make
     straight for the exit. Carla follows.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Ms. Kuhn, can we talk?

                         OSKAR
                   (to his mother)
               Where are we going?

                         CARLA
                   (shouting)
               Ms. Kuhn, please stop for a second!

                         OSKAR
                   (to his mother)
               What happened?

     Ms. Kuhn drags Oskar out of the building while people,
     including Lore Semnik, watch. Carla follows them to the door.

                          FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Come on.

                         OSKAR
               Let go of me!

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Now. Come on, please. Let's go

     Carla turns back. Her colleagues stand there in confusion -
     among them Lore Semnik. Carla ignores her colleagues and goes
     back to...

27                                                              27
     INT. OFFICE B�HM - DAY

     A distressed Mariam exits the office.

     Milosz Dudek and B�hm have been conferring.

                         CARLA
                   (to Dr. B�hm)
               Can we talk privately?

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               You can speak in front of Mr.
               Dudek.

                         CARLA
               I think we're making a big mistake.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Oh, really?

                         CARLA
               Strictly speaking, the video isn't
               clear proof.
                                                               35.


                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               It's too late to fear your own
               courage.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               And there's another problem, Carla.
               Your video violates personal
               rights. Not only Ms. Kuhn's, but
               the entire faculty's.

                          CARLA
               Shit. We shouldn't have shown her
               the video.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Spilled milk, Ms. Nowak.

                            CARLA
               What now?

                                                 CARLA (CONT'D)
            DR. BETTINA B�HM
     I'll call our lawyer, who'll      (interrupting her)
     advise us to turn the video    The police? Is that
     over to the police to file     necessary?
     charges against unknown
     persons...

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
               Until then, we must all agree on
               one phrasing, one wording, okay?
               And we must refrain from any
               accusation, suspicion or prejudice.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               Got it. I'll communicate it.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
                   (to Carla)
               Understood?

                            CARLA
               And Oskar?

28                                                               28
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Carla is correcting the last math test and stacking the
     papers by seating order.

     She turns pages, marking mistakes, but also gives praise.
     When she gets to Oskar's test, she puts down her pen and
     grows contemplative.

30                                                               30
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla hands back the tests.
                                                           36.


                    CARLA
          Not bad, Luise. Well done. Ruby and
          Ela.

                       ELA
          Awesome.

                    CARLA
          Did you guys study together?

                       ELA
          Yeah.

                    CARLA
          Tom, you've still got work to do.
          Ali, much better.

                    ALI
          Awesome, a C!

                    CARLA
              (to another student)
          You usually get at least a C. What
          happened here?

Carla approaches Oskar. He looks at her expectantly. She
hands him the test.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Congratulations. Great job, Oskar.
          Really great. Vera, well done.

The children chatter about their results.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Everyone! Hey!

The children are too loud for Carla. She claps her hands four
times.

The children clap back two time - and silence!

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          I emailed your parents about the
          deposit for our trip to England.
          Could you remind them?

The children assent.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Good. Josephine?

                    JOSEPHINE
          Could you put the overview of
          grades on the board?

Agreement, loud dissent.
                                                        37.


                    CARLA
          Who wants to see the overview of
          grades on the board?

Some students raise their hands.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Who of you would rather not see it
          displayed on the board?

Others raise their hands.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Josephine, why is this important to
          you?

                    JOSEPHINE
          I'd like to know where I stand.

                    LUKAS
          You're sitting in a chair.

                    CARLA
          Tom?

                    TOM
          What if I got the worst grade?

                    STUDENT
          Tough luck. Then study harder.

                    CARLA
          Yeah, what if you got a bad grade
          and everyone wants to see it? Ruby?

                    RUBY
          It'll pass in a week or two. No one
          will remember who got an A or an F.

                     CARLA
          If it's irrelevant, you don't need
          to see it.

The class grows loud, Carla claps four times and the students
twice.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Let's continue. I won't display the
          overview. If you want to know where
          you're at, see me after class.

The bell for recess sounds, the children jump up and rush
out.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Everyone put up your chairs.

The children put their chairs up.
                                                           38.


                    VERA
          Ms. Nowak, I need the register.

Carla hands it to her. She exits with her classmates.

Only Oskar remains motionless in his seat.

                    CARLA
          Are you waiting for something,
          Oskar?

He looks at her, his childlike face under thick locks.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          You can be proud of your
          outstanding test.

Oskar shrugs. Carla pulls a Rubik's Cube out of her bag.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Look at this. I meant to give it to
          you. Know what it is?

Oskar shakes his head.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          A magic cube. But it's about
          mathematics, not magic.

Oskar straightens up, his interest awakened.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          There are algorithms that can solve
          the cube in no time. Know what an
          algorithm is?

Oskar shakes his head.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          A clearly defined set of steps to
          solve a given problem. Look:

She swiftly twists the cube in different directions and
presto: She already has two sides of a uniform color.

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
          Wanna try?

She holds the cube out to Oskar. He takes it and cautiously
twists one side.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          I can lend it to you, if you like.

                    OSKAR
          What's the goal?
                                                        39.


                         CARLA
               For every side to show only one
               color.

     Oskar turns the cube and realizes it's not easy.

                         OSKAR
               It's getting worse.

     He makes to give it back.

                         CARLA
               Keep it until you've solved it,
               alright?

     Oskar continues to twist it cautiously.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               And if something's on your mind,
               let me know, alright?

     Oskar turns from the cube, nods.

                          CARLA (CONT'D)
               Or Ms. Semnik, your guidance
               counselor.

                         OSKAR
               Why did my mama cry yesterday?

                         CARLA
               Didn't she tell you?

     Oskar shakes his head.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               I see.

                         OSKAR
               Did you fight with her?

     Carla looks at him uneasily.

     INT. OFFICE B�HM - DAY

     Oskar and Carla enter. Dr. B�hm rises.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Hi, Oskar. Come in. Have a seat.

                         LORE SEMNIK
               Hello, Oskar.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               We called your mother, but she
               didn't answer. Want some candy?
                                                        40.


B�hm points to a bowl full of candy. Oskar grabs a piece.

                    OSKAR
          She slept in and didn't want to
          talk.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Could you call her from your cell?

This idea displeases Lore Semnik, she almost imperceptibly
shakes her head. But Oskar has already taken it out and is
dialing.

                    OSKAR
          What do I say?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          That we'd like to talk.

Oskar listens to the ringing. Ms. Kuhn answers.

                    OSKAR
          Hi, Mama. I'm in Dr. B�hm's office.
          She wants to talk to you.

Ms. Kuhn talks for quite a while from the other end of the
line. The adults look at each other.

                    OSKAR (CONT'D)
          Okay, Mama. Bye.

Oskar hangs up. Questioning looks.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          What did she say?

                    OSKAR
          That she... doesn't want to talk to
          you. And...

                    CARLA
          And?

                    OSKAR
          That you should stay out of it.

Beat.

                    OSKAR (CONT'D)
          What did Mama do wrong?

                    LORE SEMNIK
          You better have your mother tell
          you.

                    OSKAR
          No, why? Just tell me.
                                                        41.


The adults look at each other in perplexity, a state that Dr.
Bettina B�hm can't tolerate.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Okay, you're old enough and you'll
          hear about it anyway. Your mama
          won't be working here for now. I
          say "for now" because we need to
          find out what happened.

                    OSKAR
          So what happened?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Well, like I said, we need to find
          out.

                    OSKAR
          I want to know now.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Oskar, I can't tell you more right
          now.

                    OSKAR
          Is it related to the stealing?

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Why do you ask? We weren't
          discussing the stealing.

Oskar looks at all assembled.

                    OSKAR
          You won't tell me stuff and my mama
          won't be working here.

The teachers eye each other.

                    OSKAR (CONT'D)
          It wasn't her.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Nobody said it was her. Nobody is
          accusing your mama. But tell her we
          need to talk.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Oskar, let's step outside.

Lore Semnik touches him lightly on the shoulder. He gets up,
throws the candy back in the bowl and leaves the room. Ms.
Semnik follows him out.

Carla and a sighing Dr. B�hm remain behind.

                    CARLA
          That was unnecessary.
                                                               42.


                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Indeed.

                         CARLA
               I thought we'd tone it down. You
               mentioned "phrasing" and "wording."

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Firstly: I didn't say anything he
               didn't already know. Secondly: It
               was you who brought him here.

                         CARLA
               Yeah, but not to make innuendos.
               That's what we wanted to avoid.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Do yourself a favor and trust in my
               experience.

                         CARLA
               The boy is confused. Can't you see
               that?

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               He's as clear as glass and knows
               what's what. We're the confused
               ones.

     Carla looks dismayed.

33                                                               33
     INT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

     Carla and Lore Semnik smoke in a secluded corner of the
     school grounds.

34                                                               34
     INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

     Carla is pouring water into a vase she then puts a small
     bouquet of flowers into. She places the bouquet on her desk
     in preparations for parents' evening.

     She goes over to the window, looks out and nods to someone.

35                                                               35
     INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

     It's raining hard and wet umbrellas are scattered around the
     room. Some 20 parents have taken seats on their children's
     inconveniently small perches and are listening to Carla.
     Mostly it's mothers who've come. Oskar's seat is empty.

                         CARLA
               The kids are great. They're
               friendly. They help each other.
                         (MORE)
                                                        43.
                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          All in all, it's a very cooperative
          class. Of course there's room for
          improvement...

A knock at the door. TOM'S FATHER (48), who's still on the
phone, enters in a gray suit that marks him as an executive
of a medium-sized company.

                    FATHER OF TOM
          Gotta go. Alright, bye.

He throws a semi-apologetic look at Carla.

                    CARLA
          Hello.

                    FATHER OF TOM
          I'm Mr. Neuhaus, Tom's father.

                    CARLA
          Uh-huh. Have a seat. I was just
          relating a few impressions,
          stressing the importance of
          students working on their own
          accord...

She hands Tom's father a leaflet.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Here's information on the class
          trip. I also wrote an email.

                    FATHER OF TOM
          Thanks.

                    MOTHER OF JIEUN
          Jieun said the math test didn't go
          well.

                    CARLA
          That's sadly true.

                    MOTHER OF JIEUN
          Maybe it's not only the kids'
          failure.

                    CARLA
          I wouldn't make that judgment.
          Failure is too harsh a word.

                    FATHER OF TOM
          To be honest, the tasks were all
          Greek to me. It's like a black box.
          Those questions aren't meant for
          twelve-year-olds, are they?
                                                           44.


                    CARLA
          It's seventh-grade material, I
          stick with the curriculum.

JENNY'S MOTHER (42), a woman who would make a good union
representative, speaks up from her seat.

                    MOTHER OF JENNY
          Ms. Nowak, I'd like to raise
          another issue.

                     CARLA
          Sure.

                    MOTHER OF JENNY
          Jenny said there was an
          interrogation and she was coerced
          into divulging information on her
          classmates. I don't know if
          everyone knows. We, the parents,
          chatted about this on WhatsApp.
          Could you tell us a bit more about
          it?

                    CARLA
          Nobody was coerced. We asked the
          class representatives to help us.

                    MOTHER OF JENNY
          It sounded like coercion to me,
          inciting them to denounce others.

                    CARLA
          Ms. Haubrichs, again, your choice
          of words is fairly harsh. We
          requested the kids' help.

                    MOTHER OF JENNY
          By inciting them to rat on their
          classmates and stay hush about it.
          That's immense psychological
          pressure you're exerting on them.

                    CARLA
          This discretion was meant to allow
          the kids to talk freely, to offer
          them a safe space. We can talk in
          private about this issue after our
          meeting.

                    MOTHER OF JENNY
          But it concerns all of us. I don't
          understand.

There's a knock at the door.

                     CARLA
          Come in.
                                                         45.


Friederike Kuhn enters, completely soaked.

Carla's heart skips, she searches for the right words.

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
           Ms. Kuhn.

Ms. Kuhn closes the door behind her.

                       FRIEDERIKE KUHN
           Carry on.

                     CARLA
           Okay, um... Where were we?

                     MOTHER OF JIEUN
           What happened to Ali? I haven't
           heard.

Carla takes a deep breath, while watching Ms. Kuhn out the
corner of her eye.

                     CARLA
           There was a course of action I
           didn't approve of, but I can assure
           you that we have a handle on these
           problems.

                     MOTHER OF ALI
           How do you mean, "a handle?"

                      CARLA
           As I said, let's discuss it
           privately.

Silence.

                     FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               (to Carla)
           Why don't you tell the rest of the
           story?

                       MOTHER OF ALI
           The rest?

                     FRIEDERIKE KUHN
           The parents have a right to know
           what really happened.

                     CARLA
           This isn't the right time.

                     FRIEDERIKE KUHN
           The parents have a right to know
           their kids' teacher will be in
           court.

A murmur goes through the room.
                                                             46.


                         CARLA
               Ms. Kuhn, this is highly
               inappropriate.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Enough!
                   (to the other parents)
               Want to know what happened?

                         MOTHER OF JENNY
               Of course we all want to know.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               This woman made secret video
               recordings at school!

                         A PARENT
               What? Of whom?

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN
               Of faculty members. Just imagine!
               Spying! Denunciation! Slander!
               Character assassination! You name
               it! Entire lives are being ruined
               because of her presumptions. I
               wouldn't believe a word she says.

     Carla looks aghast.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (CONT'D)
               Shame on you! Yes, shame on you!

     Ms. Kuhn exits.

                         FEMALE PARENT
               Ms. Nowak, what's going on here?

     Carla is white as a sheet � some parents are, too.

     Carla hurries out of the room.

36                                                                36
     INT. TOILET - NIGHT

     Carla rushes into the toilet, hyperventilating.

     She takes a bag from a trash can and empties it into the
     sink. She repeatedly breathes into the bag, which inflates
     and deflates rhythmically.

     Her breath grows calmer.
                                                               47.

37                                                               37
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

                         VERA (O.S.)
               It was considered a bad omen, a
               sign that divine retribution was
               coming. But along came Thales of
               Miletus. Thales was a
               mathematician. He knew that a solar
               eclipse occurs when the moon passes
               between Sun and Earth. There.

     A beamer projects a representation of various solar eclipses
     onto the wall.

     Two students are standing up front and giving this
     presentation. Carla stands and watches.

                         LUISE
               These are partial, annular, and
               full solar eclipses. By way of
               mathematical calculations, Thales
               could predict exactly when the next
               solar eclipse would occur. The
               unpredictable became predictable.
               Thank you. Over and out.

     Carla and the students applaud.

                         CARLA
               Thank you, you may sit down.

     The children sit down.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               How do you think that affected
               people, the unpredictable becoming
               predictable?

     Carla looks at Oskar. He doesn't raise his hands. Jieun
     raises her hand.

                            CARLA (CONT'D)
               Jieun?

                         JIEUN
               So people stopped believing in God?

     Carla notices that Lukas is distracted by his phone. She goes
     over and takes it.

                         CARLA
               Thanks, Lukas. You'll get your
               phone back later.

     She moves away.
                                                48.


                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Stopped believing in God. You have
          a point. With a new critical
          spirit, Thales heralded the start
          of modern astronomy. Does astronomy
          ring a bell?

                    LUISE
          You mean zodiac signs?

                    CARLA
          You're thinking of astrology, which
          is different. Who knows what
          astronomy means?

                    HATICE
          Some kind of star science?

                    CARLA
          Exactly. Astronomy is the science
          of celestial bodies. People stopped
          explaining the world's phenomena
          with God or some higher power,
          instead searching for universally
          verifiable truths, which is the
          basis of modern science.

Lukas holds up a hand.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Yes, Lukas?

                    LUKAS
          Could you please put my cell in
          your bag so no one can steal it?

                    CARLA
          Don't worry, Lukas. Your phone is
          safe in class.

                    LUKAS
              (glancing at Oskar)
          I wouldn't be so sure.

                    CARLA
          Can you explain what you mean?

                    ALI
          He means me, but I didn't do it.

                    CARLA
          Correct. Ali was cleared in our
          conversation.

                    LUKAS
          I don't mean Ali. We learned in
          biology that traits are hereditary.
                                                               49.


     Some of the girls call out for him to shut up.

                         CARLA
               Okay, I don't get it. Could you
               explain?

                         LUKAS
               For example: like mother, like son.
               If the mother is fat, her child
               will be fat, too.

     Lukas grins. Some of the students again call for him to shut
     it.

                         CARLA
                   (to Lukas)
               Lukas, it isn't that... easy. But
               you're alluding to something else.
               So can you explain who inherited
               what from whom?

     Oskar looks at Carla.

                         LUKAS
               It doesn't matter anymore, right?

                         CARLA
               So you don't care to elaborate?

                         LUKAS
               No, we were discussing another
               matter.

                         FEMALE STUDENT
               Coward! Now he's shutting up.

                         CARLA
               That was a bold hypothesis, Lukas.
               Next time, think before you speak.

     Students mutter in agreement or voice their contempt. Oskar
     looks down in shame.

38                                                               38
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla is sitting at a table and has dialed a number. It
     rings.

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               Hello?

                         CARLA
               Hello, am I speaking with Ms.
               Wizorek?

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               Yes?
                                                              50.


                         CARLA
               This is Carla Nowak, Lukas'
               teacher. Do you have a minute?

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               I'm on my break, but it's good that
               you call. Can you explain what
               happened last night?

                         CARLA
                   (hesitating)
               Sorry you couldn't make it.

     Oskar enters.

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               The parents' chat says you're not
               in control. You don't want to know
               what else they wrote.

                         CARLA
               I'm actually calling to talk about
               Lukas.

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               Maybe you already know, but we
               parents will talk to school
               management.

                         CARLA
               I see. We should use the occasion
               to talk about Lukas' behavior in
               class.

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               What about his behavior?

     Carla sees Oskar looking at her seriously.

                         CARLA
                   (to Lukas' mother)
               One second.

     She puts a hand over the phone.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Oskar, you're not allowed to be
               here.

     He remains motionless.

                         MOTHER OF LUKAS (O.S.)
               Hello, Ms. Nowak?

39                                                              39
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     An empty classroom. Carla has brought in Milosz Dudek.
                                                        51.


                    CARLA
              (to Oskar)
          You can sit here.

They sit down opposite each other. Dudek remains standing.

                    OSKAR
          Why is everybody so sure?

                    CARLA
          Nobody's sure, Oskar. It's all
          being looked into.

                    OSKAR
          So why doesn't Mama return to work?

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          She's officially on vacation.

                    OSKAR
          Do you have proof?

                     MILOSZ DUDEK
          Of what?

                    OSKAR
          For your allegations.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          There are credible clues we can't
          tell you about, Oskar.

                    OSKAR
          What kind of clues?

                    CARLA
          We can't tell you, Oskar.

                     OSKAR
              (to Milosz Dudek)
          Could I talk to Ms. Nowak
          privately?

                     MILOSZ DUDEK
          Why?

With a glance, Carla signifies to Milosz Dudek: It's alright.
Dudek leaves the room.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK (CONT'D)
          I'll wait outside.

The two are left alone. Oskar takes a bag out of his pocket
and empties money onto the table, a lot of coins.

                    CARLA
          What's this?
                                                        52.


                    OSKAR
          Sixty-three euros and forty-five
          cents. My savings. You can have it.

                    CARLA
          Did your mama tell you to give me
          that?

Oskar shakes his head.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Oskar, it's not the money.

                    OSKAR
          Then what is it?

                    CARLA
          Theft is the issue. It doesn't
          matter if it's one cent or 100
          euros. It's about honesty.

Oskar stares at her.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Come on, take your money.

But Oskar ignores her. Carla starts to put the coins back
into his bag.

                    OSKAR
          Mama didn't do it.

                    CARLA
          Alright, I understand.

                    OSKAR
          It's one thing to understand, but
          you need to say it.

                    CARLA
          To say what?

                    OSKAR
          I want you to say it.

                       CARLA
          What?

                    OSKAR
          That she's innocent.

                     CARLA
          Your mama is innocent, Oskar.
          Satisfied?
                                                             53.


                         OSKAR
               Publicly! I want you to apologize
               to her publicly and set it right
               again.

                         CARLA
               Sorry, but I won't.

                         OSKAR
               Yes, you will, or else...

                         CARLA
               Or else what?

                         OSKAR
               You'll regret it.

                         CARLA
               Are you threatening me?

                         OSKAR
               Maybe.

                         CARLA
               Okay, I'll ignore your remark.

                         OSKAR
               You'll apologize to her! You'll
               apologize in public or you'll
               suffer the consequences!

     Oskar gets up and leaves the room, throwing a chair as he
     leaves.

40                                                                40
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla is standing behind a window, looking down at the
     playground where Oskar exits the building and joins Jenny and
     Hatice, their discussion inaudible. The three of them walk
     on, joining Jieun and Vera.

                         VANESSA K�NIG
                   (abruptly)
               Carla, hi. Want some cake?

                         CARLA
               What's the occasion?

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               My birthday.

                         CARLA
               Happy birthday. Having a party?

     Carla takes a piece of the cake, but doesn't bite into it.
                                                        54.


                    VANESSA K�NIG
          No, I can't keep up. I need to copy
          handouts and prepare the room for
          the parent representatives.

                    CARLA
          Can I be of any help?

                    VANESSA   K�NIG
          No worries, it'll   be alright. Say,
          the other day was   quite a
          spectacle, wasn't   it?

                      CARLA
          What was?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Parents' evening.

                    CARLA
          I don't wanna talk about it.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Alright, but you can confide in me.

Liebenwerda has approached. He takes a crumb of cake while
singing a birthday song.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          You were saying?

                      VANESSA K�NIG
          Ms. Kuhn.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Apropos Ms. Kuhn. I've decided to
          take legal steps against her.

Carla turns to her cake, then halts.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          And I heard there's a video?

                    CARLA
          Wait, just because she stole from
          me doesn't mean she stole from you.
          Someone else could've done that.

                      VANESSA K�NIG
          True.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Did you take a video or not?

Carla fails to answer.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          Can we see it?
                                                55.


                    CARLA
          Not for now.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Stupid question, but: Why not?

                     CARLA
          It's for the police. I can't show
          it around.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          "Show it around?" I'm a victim. My
          money was stolen, too � several
          times � and you're refusing to help
          me.

                    CARLA
          They were distinct events.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Carla, I feel uncomfortable knowing
          we were secretly filmed. Who else
          is in the video?

                    CARLA
          You have my word: You're not in it,
          Vanessa.

                     VANESSA K�NIG
          Well, I don't approve one way or
          the other.

                    CARLA
          Got it.

Dudek joins them.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          Any cake left?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Sure, have at it.

Vanessa gives him a piece. Dudek leaves.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          I can understand this is a bit much
          for you, Ms. Nowak. Maybe you're
          overwhelmed.

                    CARLA
              (interrupts)
          I'm not. It's all good.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          But maybe we should proceed against
          Ms. Kuhn together.
                                                             56.


                         CARLA
               The poor woman is already losing
               her job.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               "The poor woman?" Seriously?

                         CARLA
               It's no laughing matter.

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               While you feel for Ms. Kuhn, you're
               also responsible for us.

                         CARLA
               Exactly. Which is why I can't help
               you right now. Sorry.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               Unbelievable.

                         CARLA
               May I remind you, Mr. Liebenwerda,
               it was you who wanted to hire a
               private detective.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               That was a joke, jeez.

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               And there's a difference, Carla. We
               would've known about the detective.
               What you did was behind our backs.

     Beat.

                         MARIAM
               Sorry to interrupt, but students
               are outside for you.

     Carla makes a face � la gotta go, smiles and walks past the
     two of them.

41                                                                41
     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Markus and Hatice are waiting outside the teachers' lounge
     when Carla joins them.

                         MARKUS
               Hello, Ms. Nowak.

                         HATICE
               Hello, Ms. Nowak.

                         CARLA
               Hi, guys. What can I do for you?
                                                             57.


                         MARKUS
               You said we could interview you for
               our school newspaper.

                         CARLA
               Our appointment was next Tuesday.

                         HATICE
               We have to print earlier. Our room
               isn't available next week.

                            MARKUS
               Exactly.

     Carla looks into the lounge. K�nig and Liebenwerda are still
     standing there. Carla notices she's still holding the piece
     of birthday cake in her hand.

                         MARKUS (CONT'D)
               It'll only take 15 minutes.

                         CARLA
               You want some cake?

     The children nod and Carla hands it to them.

                            CARLA (CONT'D)
               Let's go.

42                                                             42
     INT. CLASSROOM/CLUB ROOM - DAY

     Carla follows the children into a room where other staff
     members of the "SCHULPOSTILLE" school newspaper await them,
     all of them from the upper grades. Posters of past projects
     and the latest issues of the newspaper are on the walls.

                         HATICE
               Here's Paul, Daniel, Bine, Krissi,
               Mitra, Flo, and don't worry about
               the rest.

     Carla nods to the group. They are all older than Hatice and
     Markus. PAUL is holding a warm cup of tea. Carla recognizes
     KRISSI and MITRA: They were in the admin office to get help
     from Ms. Kuhn.

                            KRISSI
               Hi.

                            CARLA
               Hello!

                         KRISSI
               Thanks for participating.

                            CARLA
               Of course.
                                                        58.


You can tell by the look on Carla's face: She had expected
the group to be smaller.

                    PAUL
          Please have a seat.

Carla takes a seat with the children opposite her. Some of
them have pieces of paper with questions.

                    CARLA
          Okay, shoot, what do you want to
          know?

                    PAUL
          Do you mind if we record the
          conversation? That'll make it
          easier for us.

He puts his cell phone on the table.

                    CARLA
          Sure, okay.

He presses RECORD and nods for Hatice to begin.

                    HATICE
          Ms. Nowak, you've been at our
          school since the start of the
          semester. How do you like it here?

                    CARLA
          I feel at ease. All the students
          are really nice. The faculty are
          great, too, despite a few
          differences in opinion. I was
          warmly welcomed at this school.

                    HATICE
          What are those differences in
          opinion?

                    CARLA
          What happens in the teachers'
          lounge stays in the teachers'
          lounge.

                    MARKUS
          Next question. Isn't Nowak a Polish
          name?

                    CARLA
          Yes, but I was born in Westphalia.
          My parents came to Germany in the
          late 80s from a town near Danzig.

                    HATICE
          Do you speak Polish?
                   Yellow Rev. (mm/dd/yy)               59.


                    CARLA
          Ciekawo zabila kota. (Curiosity
          killed the cat.)

                    HATICE
          What does that mean?

                    CARLA
          Research it.

                    MARKUS
          Do you have tattoos? And if so,
          where?

                    CARLA
          I always wanted tattoos, but never
          dared. Luckily.

The students grin. Carla notices Krissi whispering to Mitra.

                    HATICE
          What advice would you give your
          younger self?

                    CARLA
          Jeez, how should I put this without
          sounding precocious. To feel
          insecure as a young person is
          normal, everyone feels that way. I
          wish someone back then would've
          told me it'd all be fine and I can
          trust my gut.

Now the older students step in.

                    KRISSI
          I need to butt in. At the
          beginning, you said you feel at
          ease here. My gut feeling begs to
          differ. I think there's currently a
          bad vibe at our school.

                    CARLA
          How do you mean?

                    MITRA
          It isn't a secret that somebody's
          stealing.

Carla looks back and forth between the students.

                    PAUL
          Can you tell us why we students
          were suspected? The allegations
          were false.
                                                        60.


                    CARLA
          You're right, it wasn't right, but
          something had to be done, also to
          protect those who had nothing to do
          with it. I'm sorry the wrong people
          were suspected.

                    PAUL
          That doesn't answer my question.
          Again: Why were we suspected?

                    CARLA
          There were inconclusive leads. It
          wasn't ideal.

                    KRISSI
          Is it true that Ms. Kuhn can't
          return to the job she did for 14
          years?

                    MITRA
          Wasn't it 15?

                    KRISSI
          No, 14.

                    CARLA
          That's the school admin's decision.

                    MITRA
          So, Ms. Kuhn was suspended for
          theft?

Carla looks at the cell phone, which is still in the middle
of the table and continues to record.

                    CARLA
          I'm not in a position to comment.

                    PAUL
          Was there secret video
          surveillance?

                    CARLA
          No comment.

                    PAUL
          Don't you know or don't you want to
          comment?

                    KRISSI
          You're not allowed to?

                    CARLA
          I'd be allowed, but wouldn't think
          it right for all concerned.
                                                        61.


                    MITRA
          Doesn't it concern us, too?

                    CARLA
          Of course. It sure does.

Carla sees the younger students shift restlessly in their
chairs.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          If there are no more questions...

                    KRISSI
          Is Oskar Kuhn going to change
          schools?

                    CARLA
          Where did you hear that? Seriously,
          who said that?

                    KRISSI
          The grapevine.

                    PAUL
          Surely, you'll understand we need
          to protect our sources.

                    CARLA
          Your sources? Guys, stop spreading
          rumors. That sows distrust.

                    MITRA
          We want to know what's going on at
          our school.

                    KRISSI
          Well, that'd be all.

She addresses the younger students.

                    KRISSI (CONT'D)
          Any more questions?

They shake their heads.

                    PAUL
          Thanks, Ms. Nowak.

                    HATICE & MARKUS
          Thank you, Ms. Nowak.

                    CARLA
              (to Krissi)
          And you'll send me the article
          before it's printed?

It's not a question, more a demand.
                                                                62.


                            KRISSI
               Sure.

                            CARLA
               When?

                         KRISSI
               Once we've written it.

     Carla examines Krissi.

                            CARLA
               Good.

                         PAUL
               Oh, wait, I need a picture. Can I
               take one?

     Paul holds up the phone. Carla is aware: She's got to get
     through this.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
               Thank you.

43                                                                43
     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Carla comes out into the hallway. A student passes wearing a
     light blouse with yellow stars - the same blouse from the
     evidence video.

     The student turns the corner - it was definitely the same
     blouse!

     Carla turns to follow her, turns the corner.

     Other students walk past � they, too, are wearing the blouse.

     Tinnitus growing louder and louder.

     Carla looks down the hallway in disbelief; it's the end of
     recess and both students and teachers are rushing into
     classrooms: every single one of them wearing the same bright
     blouse with a yellow star pattern.

     Carla is surrounded by more and more people, borne away by a
     flowing mass of of yellow stars.

     The bell starts ringing, throbbing away in Carla's ears.

44                                                                44
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla enters and readies herself for the greeting ritual.
                                                          63.


                    CARLA
              (clapping, clicking
               fingers and tapping)
          Good mor-ning.

The welcome ritual falls flat: The class doesn't react.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Well, then. At least it's quiet.
          Let's check your homework. Who
          wants to begin?

Carla looks around, but no one answers. Ali makes to raise
his arm, but his seat-neighbor prevents him.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Ali, you wanted to say something?

                    ALI
          Not anymore.

Carla looks around; some of the students meet her gaze, but
most avoid it.

                    CARLA
          If no one volunteers, I'll have to
          ask you one by one. Jieun, did you
          do your homework?

Jieun silently ignores the question.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Hatice, how about you?

Hatice also remains silent, looking blankly at Carla.

Beat.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Then I'll sit down and we'll ignore
          each other.

She does so, examining the students one by one. It's so
quiet, so peaceful that one can hear birds chirping outside.
But beneath this lies a tension that even Carla can hardly
bear.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Jeez, what's going on!

                    JENNY
          Do you want to expel Oskar?

                    CARLA
          Jenny, I don't know where you heard
          that, but surely Oskar is the one
          to ask. Would you like to comment,
          Oskar?
                                                        64.


She looks at Oskar. No reaction.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Apparently not. Let's proceed with
          homework, then.

                    JENNY
          We won't proceed until you tell us
          what did and will happen.

                    CARLA
          If you want to discuss an issue,
          class council is the place for it.
          Now I'm teaching.

                    JENNY
          We have a right to know what's
          going on.

Students second her.

                    ALI
          No one apologized to me yet.

Some of the children giggle. It seems that for some of them,
this is all just fun.

                    CARLA
          That's not true, Ali. I apologized
          and so did Dr. B�hm. In her office,
          remember?

                    ALI
          What about the video?

                    CARLA
          There is no video, my God!

The students talk over one another: Yes, there is! The whole
school knows it! Don't lie to us!

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
              (loudly)
          Now be quiet and hand me your
          homework.

Oskar scribbles something in his notebook. Carla goes down
the rows and gathers the homework books. Some children hold
the notebooks out to her, others require prompting.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Give it to me.

Lukas reluctantly hands her his notebook. Carla takes a look
inside.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Where's your homework?
                                                        65.


She shakes her head and continues walking. Tom gives Oskar an
evil look.

                    LUKAS
          All because of him!

                    OSKAR
          Just do your homework.

                    CARLA
          I said quiet!

Oskar has placed his notebook on the edge of the table. Carla
takes it without a word. She puts the notebooks on her desk.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          So, who will solve the task at the
          board?

Various voices retort that no one will.

Tom holds up a hand.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Tom. Very good.

The students express their outrage as Tom moves up front.

                       JIEUN
          Traitor.

                    CARLA
          Who was that? Who said "traitor?"

                       JIEUN
          I did.

                    CARLA
          That's not okay, Jieun.

                    JIEUN
          We should practice solidarity.

General assent.

                    TOM
          Your grades permit you to. If I
          don't do this, I'll flunk.

                    JIEUN
          You're a traitor.

                    CARLA
          Jieun, use that word again and
          you're leaving the room.
                                                                66.


                         TOM
               All this crap is just because of
               him.

     Tom points at Oskar, who gives him the finger, which Tom
     returns.

                         CARLA
               Leave Oskar alone and continue with
               the task.

                         TOM
               Because of his criminal mama.

                         CARLA
               What was that?

                         TOM
               Because of his criminal mama.

                         CARLA
               Leave!

     She nods at the door. Tom looks incredulous.

                         TOM
               Huh? I'm the only one
               participating.

                         CARLA
               Now!

     Tom chucks his notebook on the floor and leaves. The class is
     silent.

                         MARKUS
               By the way, Ms. Nowak, we do that
               dumb-ass welcoming procedure only
               for you.

                         STUDENTS
               Exactly. That's right. It's stupid,
               it should be for first-graders. Do
               you know how embarrassing it is?

45                                                                45
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     A short time later, Carla is sitting looking through the
     students' homework books. She pauses as she gets to Oskar's
     book. In it there stands only today's date and:

     "MAMA IS NO THIEF, BUT MS. NOWAK IS A LIAR."
                                                             67.

46                                                                46
     INT. GYM - DAY

     The children of 7B have pulled gym mats into the center of
     the hall and are sitting in a circle. Lore Semnik is standing
     in the background, observing the circle. The mood is subdued.

                         CARLA
               Okay, guys, I already told you: The
               past days and weeks were
               unacceptable. Something has to
               change. Do any of you understand
               what I mean?

     A child holds up his hand, clicking his fingers.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Jonas?

                         JONAS
               Aren't we doing anything today?

                         CARLA
               We'll do something once we've
               discussed some issues.

     Dissenting voices call out that class council is the place
     for issues.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               We need to change the way we treat
               each other. To which end we'll do
               some exercises today. I need six
               volunteers for the first exercise.
               Who's up for it?

     Some children raise their hand.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Great. Stand up, please.

     Jenny, Jieun, Ali, Vera, Luise and Lukas come to the center.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               For the first exercise, you all
               step on this box. No one can fall.
               Give it a try.

     The children climb up on the wooden box, which offers little
     room for six. They balance for a few seconds, then fall
     repeatedly.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Okay, those still seated: Do you
               have any suggestions on how to do
               it better? Thai?
                                                         68.


                     THAI
          Maybe hold onto each other's
          shoulders.

                    CARLA
          Try it.

Now the children climb back onto the wooden box holding on to
each other by the shoulders. This works better, but again
they fall after some few seconds. The children accept this
with humor.

                    JENNY
          It won't work!

                    CARLA
          Is there maybe another solution?
          Oskar, I'm sure you have an idea.

Oskar shrugs.

                    OSKAR
          We need to take each other by the
          hand.

                    CARLA
          Would you show us how to go about
          it? Switch places with Lukas.
          Thanks, Lukas.

                    LUKAS
          Have fun, nerd.

Oskar goes to the center across from Tom. He stretches out
his arms and bids Tom do the same. They get onto the box with
each leaning back away from it.

                    CARLA
          Looks promising. Now the other four
          as well. Crisscross.

The other children follow suit so that soon all six have been
able to take their places on the box.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Great, you found the solution.

Oskar gives Tom a shove, who falls back hard. The children
cry out.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Oskar, hey!

Tom gets up, runs at Oskar and pushes him off the box.

Carla and Lore Semnik intervene and tear the two apart, but
Oskar refuses to be assuaged.
                                                                69.


                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Let go of each other!

     The affray continues.

                         LORE SEMNIK
               Tom! Stop it! Calm down!

                         OSKAR
               Come on, prick!

                         CARLA
               Outside, Oskar!

                         OSKAR
                   (to Tom)
               C'mon!

                         CARLA
               Come back when you've calmed down.

     Carla takes a deep breath.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               That's just what I was referring
               to.

     Oskar goes out into the offscreen gym hallway. There's a fire
     extinguisher in front of the teachers' locker room. He grabs
     it.

47                                                                47
     INT. GYM HALLWAY/CHANGING ROOM - DAY

     Carla and the children hear a crash. The glass door to the
     teachers' locker room has been smashed. Carla sees Oskar
     through the doorway. He has taken her laptop from her bag.
     Carla walks determinedly towards him.

                         CARLA
               Are you crazy?

     Oskar rushes her, striking her in the head with the laptop as
     she confronts him. He runs off, and once Carla has recovered
     her senses, she runs after him.

48                                                                48
     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GYM - DAY

     Carla exits the gym, the sunlight blinding her. She runs
     after Oskar.

                         CARLA
                   (shouting as she runs)
               Oskar, stop!

     They run across the street to a bridge.
                                                             70.


                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Stop!

     Oskar does so, the laptop in his hand. He looks at Carla.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Give me the laptop!

     She takes a step toward him, but Oskar throws the laptop over
     the bridge and runs away.

     Carla watches as the laptop vanishes into the depths.

                         LORE SEMNIK (PRE-LAP)
                   (reading from an
                    evaluation)
               "The events surrounding Oskar's
               mother have caused significant
               psychological pressure. Even if he
               is supported by part of his class,
               others harass him. This leads to
               turmoil in class and their refusal
               to work."

49                                                               49
     INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

     A committee has assembled: two parent representatives, four
     of Oskar's teachers, including Stahlmann, Liebenwerda and
     K�nig, and class representatives Jenny and Lukas, along with
     the principal and her deputy, Milosz Dudek, who's taking
     minutes.

     Carla, whose face still bears traces from her confrontation
     with Oskar, listens attentively to her colleague, Lore
     Semnik.

                         LORE SEMNIK
                   (reading from an
                    evaluation)
               "This student's frustration has
               vented in a propensity for
               violence, which manifests itself
               physically. My recommendations for
               now would be a change of classes.
               In case the situation doesn't
               improve for the student, a change
               of schools might be appropriate. A
               change that the mother would have
               to agree to."

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Thank you. Ms. Nowak, as their
               teacher, the floor is yours.
                                      71.


          CARLA
A change of schools would be a
total failure. Surely we can find
another solution.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Fine, but a change of class will
leave us with someone who firstly
incites subordination, secondly
beat up classmates, and thirdly
smashes windows to steal laptops.

          CARLA
He didn't want to steal it.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
But rather?

          CARLA
He wanted to protect his mother.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
If you say so, but that doesn't
undo everything. You know we have a
zero...

          CARLA
... tolerance policy. But this is
between Oskar and me. He obviously
holds me responsible for his
mother's work ban. It would be a
grave mistake to socially isolate
this student. We'd be punishing him
for his mother's possible misstep.

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Just to be clear for everyone: This
is about Oskar's behavior, not his
mother's.

          CARLA
Yeah, but we're only taking one
point of view: What can we do with
the student to solve the problem?

          DR. BETTINA B�HM
Yeah?

          CARLA
Meaning that the consequences are
borne out by others. That can't be.

          JENNY
    (quietly, almost to
     herself)
I agree.
                                                         72.


                     DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Sorry?

                    JENNY
              (louder)
          I agree that the consequences are
          borne out by others, mostly by us
          students.

Dr. B�hm turns to Carla again.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          So what do you recommend?

                    CARLA
          Because I'm also responsible, it
          shouldn't be Oskar who has to go,
          but...

                     DR. BETTINA B�HM
          But?

                     CARLA
          But me.

Derisive snorting.

                    PARENT REPRESENTATIVE
          Ms. Nowak, we're already
          understaffed. We have too many
          substitutes.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Then we may as well shut down the
          school.

Carla looks around. No one approves of her suggestion.

                     DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Out of the question. So we've heard
          Ms. Semnik's evaluation and Ms.
          Nowak's...

                    CARLA
          We're talking over the student's
          head and diverting the problem.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Firstly: we're not diverting it.
          We're looking for a democratic
          solution. Secondly: Oskar and his
          mother are totally unrepentant
          regarding their misconduct. They
          had the chance to speak here, but
          instead refused each and every
          communication. If there are no
          further questions, let's vote.
                                                        73.


                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Sorry, I do have another question.

                      DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Go ahead.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          Ms. Nowak, what happened to your
          eye?

                    CARLA
          I already said I fell.

                      VANESSA K�NIG
          Pardon?

                      CARLA
          I fell.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          It's not that hard to understand,
          is it?

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               (to Carla)
          It's admirable how you protect the
          boy.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Thomas, is this relevant? Could we
          please...

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          I just want to make sure that the
          boy doesn't hit teachers.

                    CARLA
          Mr. Liebenwerda, Oskar won't hit
          anybody.

Liebenwerda gazes at her.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          I suggest we vote, okay?

General assent.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK (CONT'D)
          Any objections to an open vote?

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          I'd prefer anonymous.

Carla looks around. Dudek hands out pieces of paper and pens.
                                                              74.


                          DR. BETTINA B�HM
                Fine, Ms. K�nig prefers anonymity.
                Then we'll vote on a suspension for
                Oskar Kuhn for ten days and if he
                can go on the school trip to
                England.

      The rustling of notes and pens. Carla is handed the slips,
      takes one and passes them on.

                          DR. BETTINA B�HM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                If the situation doesn't improve
                after our vote, we'll need to
                convene again and consider tougher
                measures, possibly a change of
                schools.

                          MILOSZ DUDEK
                Please hand me your votes.

      EXT. FOYER - DAY

      An isolated Carla is standing outside the foyer and watching
      her colleagues exit the school and wish each other a pleasant
      evening. As she walks along, she sees a school newspaper
      billboard in a window inviting all to READ ALL ABOUT WHAT'S
      REALLY HAPPENING. Concerned, she starts walking faster.

50                                                                 50
      INT. FOYER - DAY

      Paul is hanging up a school newspaper sign, moving it left
      and right as instructed by his coeval, YAW, as Ms. Nowak
      strides into the room.

                          YAW
                Look, there's Ms. Nowak.

      Carla approaches the group.

                          CARLA
                Selling already?

                          PAUL
                No, on Monday. But we're preparing
                for it.

                          MARKUS
                Would you like a copy? Two euros.

                          CARLA
                Two euros? Isn't that a lot for a
                school newspaper?
                                                               75.


                         YAW
               Well, we have expenses: printing,
               research, equipment... Milk and
               coffee aren't free, either.

                         CARLA
               Weren't you going to send me the
               article?

     Paul and Yaw look at each other: confusion.

                         PAUL
               Didn't Krissi?

                         CARLA
               I didn't received anything.

                         YAW
               Hm. Well, then here's a pre-release
               issue for free.

     He holds a newspaper out to her. Carla takes it.

     Paul and Yaw watch as Carla skims the lines.

                         CARLA
               Are you serious?

                         PAUL
               Why? We only wrote what...

     Carla sees the large cardboard box on the table. She places
     it under her arm and, to the children's dismayed cries, walks
     into the...

51                                                               51
     INT. CLUB ROOM - DAY

     Carla enters the editorial/newspaper club room, placing the
     box on Krissi and Mitra's table as she speaks:

                         CARLA
               Take out those pages.

                            KRISSI
               Why?

                         CARLA
               You twisted and decontextualized
               things. It's a matter between Ms.
               Kuhn and me.

     The other students have stopped work and are listening.

                         MITRA
               We see that differently.
                                                        76.


                    KRISSI
          It's called journalism.

                    CARLA
          It's not journalism. You promised I
          could check it.

                     KRISSI
          We won't be censored for you to
          save face.

                    CARLA
          We had a deal, it's not about face-
          saving.

                      MITRA
          No?

                    CARLA
          Censorship isn't the issue, facts
          are.

                    KRISSI
          Which you withheld. We shed light
          on the flip side.

                    CARLA
          You talked to Ms. Kuhn?

                    KRISSI
          We sure did.

Carla takes a deep breath.

                    CARLA
          Guys, you overshot the mark. The
          text is dubious. If you only knew
          the damage you're doing.

                    KRISSI
          We serve truth.

                    MITRA
          If you can't take it, that's your
          problem.

                      KRISSI
          See that?

Krissi points to a sign hanging behind Carla:

VERITAS OMNIA VINCULA VINCIT! (Truth overcomes all bounds.)

                    MITRA
          Everything else is PR.
                                                                77.

52                                                                52
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla is standing in the vacant lounge.

                         LORE SEMNIK (O.S.)
                   (entering)
               You wanna talk?

                         CARLA
               Just give me a hug.

     Lore Semnik moves over towards her. The two hug for some
     time.

53                                                                53
     INT. FOYER - DAY

     Students stream into the school. Carla does, too. A small
     crowd has formed in front of the stand: Everyone wants the
     newspaper!

                         YAW
               Hello, Ms. Nowak! School newspaper
               while supplies last...!

54                                                                54
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla enters unnoticed � several colleagues are already
     engrossed in the paper.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               Why didn't she come to us for help?

                         VANESSA K�NIG
               Where's her team spirit?

     All look at Carla as she goes over to her pigeonhole, her
     head held high.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               Good morning, Ms. Nowak, I
               sometimes wonder what you're
               thinking.

     Liebenwerda reads from the newspaper.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
               Here: "Ideally, school is a
               protected space for students. Not
               so at our school. Following a
               series of thefts, we students were
               faced with measures otherwise found
               in rogue regimes. Fellow student
               Ali Yilmaz was taken from class in
               a raid-style operation and wrongly
               accused.
                         (MORE)
                                                           78.
                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          The teachers were Milosz Dudek and
          Thomas Liebenwerda." My humble
          self.

                    CARLA
          No need to read it aloud, but
          thanks anyway.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          I'd like to hear it.

Carla notices her colleagues are now listening in to the
confrontation.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              (ignoring her)
          "To suspect a child of migrant
          parents without proof in that
          manner exposes the structural
          racism our school, like many
          others, can't escape. But that's
          not all. With neither concrete
          evidence, nor need, the school's
          kind soul, Friederike Kuhn, got
          suspended from work. The method
          isn't for the faint hearted: a
          hidden camera." So there it is.

Liebenwerda looks Carla in the face. She smiles mildly: What
do you want from me?

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
          "Because Ms. Nowak couldn't rebut
          our suspicion of secret video
          surveillance at school, we spoke to
          the victim. Ms. Kuhn confirmed the
          method..." And so on. How is it
          possible that you keep refusing to
          cooperate with us faculty, but
          discuss the video with attention-
          seeking pubescents?

                    CARLA
          You know, Mr. Liebenwerda, I prefer
          discussing issues to staying
          silent. If you've read the text
          attentively, you'll know I didn't
          discuss the video.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          You didn't rebut their suspicions,
          either. I know how to read.
          Unbelievable. You're something.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Enough. We can read it ourselves.
          We get it. Leave it be.
                                                        79.


                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          You want to win over students at
          any cost no matter the consequences
          for us. You know how many parents
          are contacting us? Vanessa received
          25 e-mails.

By now, confusion reigns as all the teachers are speaking
over one another.

Milosz Dudek and Dr. Bettina B�hm enter. Carla turns around.
Dudek and B�hm each hold a copy of the newspaper.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM
              (addressing everyone)
          May I have your attention? Come
          over here. Quiet, please. You too,
          Mr. Liebenwerda. You'll all be
          aware that the school newspaper
          contains an unfortunate article.
          I've spoken with Mr. Dudek and the
          school's legal department. We're
          left with no other option but to
          ban the sale of this issue on
          campus.

The colleagues cast critical glances at each other.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          Dr. B�hm and I will close down
          their stand and ask you to prevent
          distribution in class.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          What about the online version?

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          IT took it down from the school's
          website.

Dr. B�hm nods at him.

                     DR. BETTINA B�HM
          Peace at our school is massively
          under fire, which is why I ban you
          all from discussing this issue any
          further. Mum's the word � for
          everybody.

She looks around, then turns to Carla.

                    DR. BETTINA B�HM (CONT'D)
          We'll talk to you later with staff
          council.

Carla is stoic. B�hm leaves.
                                                        80.


The remaining group of some 15 teachers look at each other in
bemusement. In the background, a teacher walks by, wearing a
star blouse identical to that of Ms. Kuhn. No one notices.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          So we're forbidden to speak?

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Stop it. Is it so hard to grasp?
          It's a framework we can work with.

More and more voices are being raised until Dudek shouts them
down:

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
          People, hey! We're only briefly
          asking you to keep still. We need a
          united front, even if we disagree
          at times.

Lore and Thomas look at each other.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
          I won't let anyone call me a
          racist. And neither should you.

                    MILOSZ DUDEK
              (checking the time)
          Let's take care of our students and
          carry out our work.

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
              (leaving in annoyance)
          Alright, back to work. Let's give
          them passing grades no matter how
          much they act up.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Cut the shit with your cynicism!

                    THOMAS LIEBENWERDA.
          Lore, I won't be called a racist.

                    LORE SEMNIK
          Got it. You'd better leave.

                     THOMAS LIEBENWERDA.
          Ignoring problems won't make them
          disappear.

                    VANESSA K�NIG
          Take a deep breath, everyone. Well
          done, Carla. Just saying.

She leaves.
                                                             81.


                         MILOSZ DUDEK
                   (softly, in Polish)
               You should've said something.

                         CARLA
                   (in German)
               What?

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
                   (in German)
               What do I mean? The interview.

                         CARLA
               It was Oskar.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               Forget about the boy.

                         CARLA
               That's a great attitude for our
               job. Thanks for the advice.

     She leaves.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
                   (calling out after her)
               You're responsible for the other
               students, too!

     Carla slams the door.

56                                                             56
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla enters. Oskar's seat is empty.

                         CARLA
               Okay, everyone, sorry for the
               delay. May I ask you all to rise?

     The students stand up. Questioning looks.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               I want... Get up! I want us all to
               scream as loud as we can. Ready,
               steady, go!

     AAAAARGHH! But only half of the children join in. Some just
     open their mouths without actually hollering.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               Again. Don't hold back, everyone,
               go! Keep going!

     AAAAARGHH! The whole class screams at the top of their lungs.
     This is loud. Silence falls. Carla has shut her eyes. She
     opens them again and looks around the room.
                                                        82.


                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Thanks. Before we start, a few
          clarifying words: All of you know
          what happened in the gym the other
          day. Oskar will be suspended for
          ten days. He can't go on our school
          trip, either. Furthermore, the
          school newspaper caused displeasure
          among faculty. School management
          thus banned its circulation on
          campus.

                    JENNY
          That's censorship!

                    CARLA
          Jenny, I agree it's a shocking
          measure.

                    JENNY
          Well, I surely won't hide my copy.

                    CARLA
          In principle, I admire how you all
          organize the newspaper and declare
          your solidarity, though I find the
          text highly dubious.

Hatice holds up a hand.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Yes?

                    HATICE
          Sorry. It wasn't intended against
          you.

                    CARLA
          Thanks, Hatice. So put the
          newspapers away.

Oskar enters and goes over to his seat without a word. He's
wearing a dark hoodie hanging down over his eyes to make him
seem menacing.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Oskar! What are you doing here?

He says nothing.

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Your mother received a letter.

                    LUISE
          What letter?

                    CARLA
          I just told you.
                                                             83.


     Lukas gets up and wanders around.

                         LUKAS
                   (a hat down over his face,
                    his fingers a pistol)
               I'm Oskar on a killing spree.

                         CARLA
               Lukas, sit down!

     A voice calls out for applause and the children sarcastically
     applaud Oskar. Chaos ensues.

                            CARLA (CONT'D)
               Hey!

     Carla goes over to Oskar's desk.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
                   (to Oscar)
               Let's step outside. Come on, Oskar.
               It's not allowed. You can't be
               here.

                            STUDENT
               Go home!

                         CARLA
                   (to Vera)
               Look after Oskar.

57                                                                57
     INT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Carla strides down to the lounge.

58                                                                58
     INT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY

     Milosz Dudek is speaking to Thomas Liebenwerda, apparently
     trying to persuade him to come to terms with Carla. As
     Liebenwerda gruffly agrees, Dudek exits � now Thomas
     Liebenwerda is the only teacher, in front of him his
     Tupperware box of sandwiches. Carla swallows her pride.

                         CARLA
               Mr. Liebenwerda, may I ask for your
               help?

     He sighs his assent. She gestures to the door.

                            CARLA (CONT'D)
               Thank you.

59                                                                59
     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Liebenwerda and Carla walk down the hallway together.
                                                               84.

60                                                               60
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla and Thomas Liebenwerda enter the classroom, where Oskar
     is still seated.

                         CARLA
               Hey, everyone, pack your stuff.
               We're going next door and Mr.
               Liebenwerda will stay here.

                         TOM
               Why do we have to move?

                         CARLA
               No back-talk, let's go.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA.
               Come on, no back-talk. Do as Ms.
               Nowak says.

     The children pack their things and leave the classroom. Carla
     glances back at Liebenwerda, who indicates she's not to
     worry.

     Carla exits with the students.

     Mr. Liebenwerda takes a seat.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA. (CONT'D)
               Hey, Oskar.

61                                                               61
     INT. ADJACENT CLASSROOM - DAY

     The students are in the adjacent classroom. Carla flips
     through her math book.

                         CARLA
               Please turn to... page... 46. And
               do exercise 13, sections A to F.
               I'll be right back.

     Carla hastily writes the math assignment on the board, grabs
     her cell phone from her bag and exits.

62                                                               62
     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Carla paces restlessly, her phone to her ear.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
               Kuhn speaking.

                         CARLA
               Hello, Ms. Kuhn. It's Carla Nowak.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
               You have some nerve calling me.
                                                        85.


                    CARLA
          It's about Oskar. Did you not get
          the letter?

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          I did. You think you can do that to
          us?

                    CARLA
          No, but there's no point misusing
          him for a matter between us two.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          Who's misusing whom? Expelling
          Oskar solves the problem?

                    CARLA
              (adamant)
          I intervened on his behalf.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          Congratulations, that worked like a
          charm.

                    CARLA
          You didn't even attend.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          So now it's my fault?

                    CARLA
          That's beside the point.

The door of the adjoining class opens: Jieun and Luise come
out, looking with interest in Carla's direction.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          Yes, it is.

                    CARLA
              (to the students)
          Back to class, please.

                    LUISE
          But we need to pee.

              CARLA                 FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
Then hurry.                     Face the fact that you're
                                responsible. How about an
                                apology?

                    CARLA (CONT'D)
          Please come pick up your son.

                    FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
          If Oskar wants to come home, he
          can.
                                                               86.


                         CARLA
               We told him to leave but he won't
               listen.

                         FRIEDERIKE KUHN (O.S.)
               You're so incompetent. Your failure
               as a teacher isn't my problem, Ms.
               Nowak.

     Carla sees Dr. B�hm and Milosz Dudek heading towards the
     classroom where Oskar and Liebenwerda are. Carla starts to
     move.

                         CARLA
               This is about your son, Ms. Kuhn.
               If we fail, it affects us both.

     Carla hangs up, visibly charged as she heads for the
     classroom.

63                                                                63
     INT. HALLWAY/CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla gets back to the classroom and glances inside. Oskar is
     still sitting in his seat. Dr. B�hm and Milosz Dudek are
     talking to him. Liebenwerda meets her at the door.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               I can't get through to him. No
               reaction. Did you reach his mother?

     Carla nods.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA (CONT'D)
               And?

     Carla throws her arms up in the air.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA.
               He's been expelled. We could have
               him removed.

                         CARLA
               I'll talk to him again.

                         THOMAS LIEBENWERDA
               Try it.

     Carla enters. Dr. B�hm is in the middle of a monologue.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
               Pack your bag and go home. Don't
               make us call the police.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               You understand, Oskar?
                                                                87.


     Oskar ignores them. Carla approaches, clearing her throat
     before sitting down opposite the boy.

                         CARLA
               Oskar, will you look at me?

     He looks Carla in the face.

                         CARLA (CONT'D)
               I wish it had all turned out
               differently. I'm honestly sorry for
               what happened. But if you don't go
               home now, you'll make things worse.

     Oskar starts to cry.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
                   (to Carla and Dudek)
               Colleagues, can we step outside?

     B�hm and Dudek move off, Carla follows them to the door.
     Dudek begins to talk.

                         MILOSZ DUDEK
               I don't know...

     Carla shuts the door behind them, remaining inside herself.

     Through the pane in the door, Dr. B�hm sees Carla lock it.

                         DR. BETTINA B�HM
                   (through the glass)
               Ms. Nowak? What are you doing?

     Carla raises her hand and gestures to B�hm: I've got this!
     She turns back to Oskar � now they're alone. Perplexity
     reigns outside the door.

64                                                                64
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla pulls up a chair and sits down next to Oskar.

     She takes some notebooks from her bag and starts working.

     Carla glances back through the door-pane where B�hm, Dudek,
     and Liebenwerda discuss. Carla nods to them again and they
     abandon the situation. Carla gets to marking homework.
     Oskar's gaze wanders over to her. When Carla looks over at
     him, he looks away again, trying to conceal his interest.

     The sound of an approaching thunderstorm.
                                                               88.

65                                                                65
     INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

     Carla stands at the window and looks out into the rain: It's
     the end of the school day and her other students leave the
     school premises. Carla turns to Oskar, who has his elbows and
     head on the desk.

     Ms. Kuhn arrives by bike, looking for her son. She and Carla
     stare at each other long and hard until Ms. Kuhn bicycles
     away.

     Carla sits down again by Oskar.

     A telephone rings, its sound coming from Oskar's backpack,
     but he doesn't move.

                         CARLA
               Won't you answer that, Oskar?

     But Oskar just remains there, his head on the desk. The
     ringing stops.

66                                                                66
     INT. CLASSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

     The sun has nearly set. Carla fills a glass of water at the
     faucet and places it in front of Oskar, pushing it lightly
     towards him. He doesn't touch it, but stares pointedly at

     conference rooms, the teachers' lounge � all silent.
