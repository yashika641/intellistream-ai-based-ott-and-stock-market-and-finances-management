1      INT. HEADQUARTERS (MANHATTAN) - NIGHT                        1

       The night is banging at HEADQUARTERS, a gentlemen's club in
       the heart of the city. A large central part of the room is
       filled with couches and seats where flirting and light lap
       dances happen. Around the edge of that are smaller curtained
       off areas and rooms where even more "in-depth" dances and
       interactions happen. A pop song blasts in the club. There are
       50 girls and 15 guys downstairs and 20 girls and 5 guys
       upstairs. Throughout the club are 3 security guards, a DJ,
       the owner and the owner's right hand man. The music is so
       loud that everyone is essentially shouting at all times.

       The camera dollies down a row of lap dances, one after
       another. Some are heavy grinding while others are putting on
       a show. We land on the sixth dancer who is facing away from
       her customer as she thrusts back on him. This is ANI (23).
       The camera locks on a medium CU shot on her face.

       The opening credits roll over this section.

                                                     HARD CUT TO:


2.1    INT. HEADQUARTERS - VARIOUS - NIGHT - LATER              2.1

       The camera follows Ani throughout her night, establishing the
       club's operations, social interactions, clientele and
       geography. It's full of private rooms each with their own
       style. Ani performs different types of dances, some private,
       some out in the open.

                                                         CUT TO:

4      INT. HEADQUARTERS - BACKSTAIRS - NIGHT - LATER                  4

       Ani's friend/co-worker LULU (19) walks down the stairs and
       scans the room. She sees Ani and motions to her - putting up
       two fingers and pointing upstairs. Ani sees this and excuses
       herself from the bar conversation she's having.

                                                            CUT TO:

       Ani and Lulu give a private 2-on-1 dance to a middle aged
       man. While grinding, without the guy noticing, they exchange
       looks that say... "want to smoke?"


7      EXT. HEADQUARTERS - FRONT SIDEWALK - NIGHT - LATER              7

       In the winter night, Ani and Lulu shiver as they pass a blunt
       back and forth. A bouncer is admitting two businessmen into
       the club in the background.
                                                              3.


A8   INT. HEADQUARTERS - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT                       A8

     From a distance, we observe Ani and her co-workers work the
     main floor. (We roll without a cut for ten minutes) Ani knows
     some of the clients by their first name.

     Ani passes by DIAMOND (23). They clearly are not fond of each
     other.

                          DIAMOND
               Ani, was Robert at the club
               yesterday?

                         ANI
               Yeah.

                         DIAMOND
               And did he ask for a dance?

                         ANI
               Yeah.

                         DIAMOND
               And did you give him one?

                         ANI
               Yeah?

     Diamond is not pleased.

                         DIAMOND
               Ok.

     Diamond walks away with an expletive under her breath. Ani
     shrugs it off.

                         ANI
               Ok.

     Ani is eating dinner from a tupperware container while
     scrolling on her phone(in a super distinctive blinged out
     pink phone case). Lulu is sitting in front of the mirror next
     to two other dancers. They are doing their make-up and
     vaping.
                                                         4.

          Dude, the DJ is a fuckin' asshole.
          I swear to god.

                    LULU
          He's Jimmy's cousin. That's the
          only reason he has this gig.

                    ANI
          Fucking attitude on this guy. I
          gave him my playlist and he said
          maybe. Fucking maybe.

                    LULU
          And how old is he? Like 40? Shit.

JIMMY (50) HQ's owner and DAWN (30), HQ's manager, enter the

Ani doesn't want to answer.

          knows Russian.

                    ANI
          Your cousin better show some
          respect around here or he ain't
          getting shit from the girls.

                    JIMMY
          I'll talk with him. C'mon.

          I'm so deadass right now, Jimmy.

                    JIMMY
          Seriously, what? What do you want
          me to do?

                    ANI
          He gave me attitude when I gave him
          my playlist.

                    JIMMY
          That's it? Attitude? I'm so sorry
          your feelings are hurt but I don't
          really give a care. Alright?

    Ani and JIMMY arrive at table twelve where IVAN (21) is
    sitting with his friend ALEKS (20's, Russian-American), who
    is already in conversation with another dancer.

                        JIMMY
              Gentlemen, please meet Ani. She'll
              take care of you tonight. Let me

    Ani sits next to Ivan.

              Thank you.

          I don't speak Russian but I know
          Russian.

Ivan is confused.

                    ANI (CONT'D)
          I can speak Russian but I'd just
          prefer not to. But you go ahead,
          speak Russian. I can understand.

                    IVAN
          I don't understand.

          Ok, hello Ivan. I'm Ani. This is
          how I speak Russian. (beat) Do you
          still want me to speak Russian?

They both laugh.

          You're not bad.

          Well thank you but I disagree.

                    IVAN
          So how do you know Russian then?

          My grandmother never learned
          English so... But enough about me.
          You two from Russia?

          Cool. On vacation?

10   INT. HEADQUARTERS - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                  10

     Ani gives Ivan a dirty lap dance.

     During the dance, Ivan places a $100 bill in Ani's bikini
     bottom strap. Ani turns it up a notch. Ivan places another
     $100 bill in the strap, she turns around and straddles him,
     reaches back and removes her top.

                         ANI

               No touching.

     She rides for a little while and then... another $100 bill.
     She smiles and spins around. Now sitting on his lap, she
     grabs his hands and places them on her breasts as she
     continues to grind back into him.

     When the fourth $100 bill is offered...

                         ANI
               Ok, can you sit on your hands for

     Ivan complies.

               And you gotta keep them there ok?
                   (Russian)
               This is a no-no. But I like you.

     Ivan nods. Ani stands, turns and removes her bottoms.
     Twirling the thong around on her finger, she sits and
     straddles. Ivan is losing his mind.


11   INT. HEADQUARTERS - UPSTAIRS COUCHES - NIGHT                 11

     Ivan and Ani are lounging on one of the black leather
     couches. One her legs is up over his. They toast and do a
     shot of vodka. Ivan says his cheers in Russian and talks Ani
     into toasting in Russian as well.

     Ivan gives Ani his phone, unlocking it as he passes it to

29    INT. MANSION - FAMILY ROOM - LATER                        29

      MUSIC IS BLASTING and DISCO LIGHTS ARE PULSATING. In the
      FAMILY ROOM/LIVING ROOM AREA, Ani, Lulu, Ivan and his party
      entourage/hanger-ons are draped over a large, extravagant
      couch. Lots of open drug-use. Champagne flows and shots of
      vodka are being poured. Everyone is having fun. During the
      chaos, Ani and Ivan toast their champagne glasses.

      On the other side of the room, Tom's sister CRYSTAL (18,
      little sister-type) jumps on Ivan and tries to make out with
      him. Ivan pushes her away.

                          IVAN
                    (screaming over music)
                Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm a taken man
                already.

                             CRYSTAL
                Oh really?

                                                  21.


Crystal awkwardly exits the moment.

Ivan leans into Ani so he doesn't have to yell.

      The Times Square ball drop coverage is on the large TV in the
      living room. Aleks jumps up on a nearby couch.

                Oh shit! It's almost midnight!
                (Russian) It's almost midnight.

      This gets everyone's attention. Behind them, in the KITCHEN
      AREA, two men stand out in the midst of the youthful party.
      TOROS (50's, Armenian-American) and GARNIK (40's, Armenian-
      American) monitor the proceedings with their arms crossed.

      Aleks complies.

      The crowd is watching fireworks in the distance. They light
      up the NYC skyline with every color. Tom offers everyone
      swigs from the champagne bottle. Using the fire pit to light,
      Ivan and his buddies shoot roman candles off the balcony. Ani
      and Lulu join in.

      Ivan can barely respond, he's in such bliss. Suddenly, a

                 Yes, I'm serious. I said I'm

       Ani considers it for what seems like forever. Finally she
       waves her left hand drawing attention to her ring finger.

     They are on the jet headed back to NYC. Ivan, Tom, Aleks,
     Dasha and Crystal are passed out. Ani studies Ivan. The harsh
     sunlight creeps up Ivan's face. Ani sees this. She reaches
     over and pulls down the window shade.

     SUNNY (21). Everyone is happy for Ani. Dawn, who hangs in the
     back, is the only one looking a little sour.

     Ani walks toward the door with her packed bag. Lulu walks
     aside her, proud of her friend. Ani runs over and hugs a few
     friends near the bar. Near the entrance, she passes Diamond
     who is standing near the door.

     The two women are in each other's faces.

               Hey hey hey.

     It's all about to explode... when Ani suddenly grabs
     Diamond's head and plants a big fat obnoxious kiss on the
     lips. Diamond immediately reacts and pushes Ani away. Ani
     laughs. Diamond lunges forward but Lulu and the HQ SECURITY
     GUARD jumps in before she can connect. Ani exits into the

               In case his boys are here... and
               they want to play games.

     They arrive at the front gate. Igor opens the driver's side
     window. Garnik leans over Igor and addresses the security
     guard.

                         GARNIK (CONT'D)
               Hey. Is Ivan home?

               He hasn't left while I've been here
               but my shift just started.

               Open the gate.

     The gate opens and Igor drives on to the property.

     Garnik and Igor exit their car and walk toward the house.
     It's a cold winter day and their breath is visible. The men

     Ivan motions to her to keep quiet. Ani is confused. Ivan gets
     up, pulls up his basketball shorts and tip-toes over to the
     door. Ani pulls up her panties. He looks through the windows
     to the side of the door. He recognizes Garnik. He has a
     silent freak out.

Garnik tries to talk to Ivan through the glass, projecting
his voice.

Ani's eyebrows raise at the word guest.

Ani who is now concerned.

     the door.

     Ivan realizes the door is opening and quickly runs towards
     the door and tries to push it back closed. Garnik sees this
     and thrusts his foot in the door jam to stop it from closing
     entirely.

gentler approach.

               family... so I'm thinking that
               means you work for him. He told you
               to take it outside. Now, take it
               outside.

     Toros' phone call continues.

                   (Russian)
               I've seen the marriage license.

     Screams come from the other side and once again Toros has to
     pull the phone away from his ear.

                         TOROS (CONT'D)
                   (Russian)
               Oh, I can't. I'm not with him.   I'm
               actually not there. Garnik is.   But
               I'm going over there right now   to
               fix this. It will be fixed. Do   not
               worry.

     Toros listens to the angry Zakharovs on the other end for a
     moment.

                         TOROS (CONT'D)
                   (Russian)
               Oh no. That's not necessary.
               Really. You don't have to... I can
               handle this. Ok, ok. Got it. Yes
               sir. And yes, ma'am.

     Garnik and Igor are being pushed out the door by Ivan. Igor
     is doing as asked and completely complying. Ani is standing,
     arms crossed. Garnik is delaying as politely as possible.

      Toros storms out of the backroom wearing his winter coat. He
      doesn't stop walking but addresses the parents and priest.

                           TOROS
                I'm so sorry I must go. There's an
                emergency.

      Everyone is in shock. He turns to his wife.

      He answers.

       Igor is slightly amused by the chaos. Ani is confused, upset
       and starting to get angry. Toros (on speaker) proceeds to lay
       into Ivan (in Russian). He tells him how irresponsible he is
       and how much he screwed him after allowing him so much
       freedom while in America. Garnik awkwardly holds the phone
       for everyone to hear.

                           ANI
                 I have no fucking idea.

                           TOROS
                 Ok, he better be there.

                           GARNIK
                 I have to go to the hospital, man.

                           TOROS
                 No, you don't. You're fine. We find
                 Ivan and then... my wife will patch
                 you up. She's good at that.

                           GARNIK
                     (Armenian)
                 I think I have a concussion, man.

       The two continue to argue about going to the hospital. In the
       backseat, Igor turns to Ani.

                            IGOR
                 Sorry for what happened back there.
                 It didn't have to be that
                 difficult.

       Ani turns and glares and then turns forward.

                           ANI
                 I don't want him talking to me.

                           TOROS
                 (Russian) Leave her alone man.

       Garnik begins complaining again.

                           IGOR
                     (Russian)
                 Swing by my place. I have something
                 for him.

                           TOROS
                 Goddamn it!


A116   EXT. BRIGHTWATER - DAY                                  A116

       They are parked in front. Igor exits the building, enters the
       car. He hands three pills up to Garnik who pops them in his
       mouth. Igor is taken aback to see him take all three at once.

                           TOROS
                 Ok? Good? Let's go.

       Toros drives off.


116    EXT. WEST 10TH ST. - DAY                                    116

       The escalade pulls on to 10th St.

                           TOROS
                 The hell is this?

       The car can't pull any further forward due to the street
       being closed and blocked by two concrete NYPD barricades.
       Toros throws it in to park.

                           TOROS (CONT'D)
                 Ok, out. Let's go.
                                                                 84.


      The crew exits the parked Escalade. Toros looks back and
      locks the car with his key.

                          IGOR
                (Russian) Car is ok there?

                          TOROS
                It's fine. Let's go.

      The crew walks down 10th Street past the CYCLONE
      rollercoaster.

      They walk up onto the boardwalk and take a right... walking
      down to the Vape Shop.


119   INT. VAPE SHOP - DAY                                        119

      The crew enter the small shop. Crystal and Tom are behind the
      counter. They can tell something is up.

                             CRYSTAL
                Hey Ani.

                          ANI
                Hey guys. Have you guys seen Ivan?

      Crystal and Tom look at each other. Tom shakes his head.

                             CRYSTAL
                Not today.

                          TOROS
                You talk to him today?

                          TOM
                Who are you?

                          TOROS
                I asked you a question.

                          TOM
                And I asked you a question.
                                                           85.


                    TOROS
          Look, Ivan's in a lot of trouble.
          We need to find him. We need to
          know if you talked with him?

                    TOM
          And I'll ask you again... who the
          fuck are you?

Toros is triggered. Igor can tell this may get ugly. Ani
jumps in.

                    ANI
          Can you call Ivan for me?

                    CRYSTAL
          And why can't you call him?

                    ANI
          Just... can you do me a favor and
          call him?

                     CRYSTAL
          Actually I find this peculiar.
              (beat)
          Who are these guys and why are you
          asking other people to call your
          husband for you?

                    ANI
          Crystal, we have a problem and I
          need to find Ivan.

Crystal looks at Tom.

                    CRYSTAL
          What's the problem?

                    TOROS
          Enough. One of you call Ivan, now.

                    TOM
          This isn't our business man. We
          haven't seen him so...

Tom motions for them to leave the shop.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          ...Thank you.

                    TOROS
          If you aided him in this fraud of a
          marriage, then it is your business.
                                                           86.


Ani's heart drops. Garnik steps in.

                    GARNIK
          One of you better get Ivan on the
          line now.

Crystal and Tom laugh at Garnik.

                    TOM
          What does `on the line' mean, you
          old fuck.

                    TOROS
          One of you call Ivan now.

Again they refuse.

Toros has had enough and walks towards the counter
aggressively.

                    TOROS (CONT'D)
          Give me your phone, you little
          fuck.

Tom takes out a golf club.

                    TOM
          I don't think so.

Tom comes out from behind the counter holding the golf club.
The crew begins to back up.

                    TOM (CONT'D)
          Leave. Now. C'mon. Out.

Igor does not like being threatened and moves slowly. Tom
pokes Igor to get him out the door. Not a good move. Igor
stops, turns and looks at Tom.

                    IGOR
          What are you planning to do with
          that?

                    TOM
          I'm planning out beating your ass
          if you don't get out now.

Suddenly, Igor snatches the golf club out of Tom's hand.

                      IGOR
          Now what?
                                                          87.


                    TOROS
          Call Ivan now or my friend here is
          going to practice his stroke on
          your fucking face.

                       TOM
          Fuck you.

Igor looks at Toros who gives an approving nod. Igor swings
the club down through the glass shelves on his right. They
explode and shatter numerous glass bongs in the process.

Tom and Crystal scream for him to stop. He turns and smashes
the top of the glass counter.

                    CRYSTAL
          Stop! Tell him to stop!

Ani looks at Crystal.

                    ANI
          Fucking call Ivan. NOW!

Shaking, Crystal calls Ivan.

Ani grabs the phone.

                       TOROS
          Speaker.

Ani hits the speaker button. They hear it goes to voicemail.
Ani drops the phone. Toros spins to Tom.

                    TOROS (CONT'D)
          You. Call him now.

Tom starts to call him.

                       TOROS (CONT'D)
          Speaker.

It goes to voicemail. We hear Ivan's obnoxious greeting
again.

                    TOROS (CONT'D)
          Where are his other friends?

Ani looks at Crystal.

                    ANI
          Is he with Aleks?
                                                                88.


                          CRYSTAL
                    (in tears)
                I told you. I don't know.

      Tom struggles on the floor in pain.

                          TOM
                He can't be with Aleks! Aleks is at
                work.

                          TOROS
                Where does he work?

      Crystal looks to her brother for approval. Tom shrugs.

                             CRYSTAL
                Tatiana's.

                          TOROS
                Ok, let's go.

      The crew files out of the shop.

                                                      HARD CUT TO:


120   EXT. BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             120

      They walk out onto the boardwalk. Igor is still winding down
      from the confrontation and Ani is obviously very upset about
      being hung up on. Ani steels herself against the cold wind
      with the sable.

                          TOROS
                Ok, let's go.

                    (Russian)
                That's a 10 minute walk.

      Toros starts walking.

                          TOROS
                It's faster if we walk. I'm not
                finding parking again.

      Ani, Igor and Garnik huff and puff as they follow Toros. We
      track with the four down the boardwalk. They all smoke.
                                                              89.

      The sea themed and more low-key sister of the famed TATIANA'S
      GRILL, a Brighton Beach staple. The crew arrives.


122   INT. TATIANA'S GRILL - DAY                               122

      The crew enter and are greeted by a HOSTESS.

                          HOSTESS
                Table for four?

                Aleks?

      They look around the main room where an affable SINGER
      performs and patrons enjoy the music. Ani points toward the
      kitchen.

Aleks takes out his phone and calls Ivan. Toros snatches the
phone out of Aleks's hand. He listens. Goes to voicemail.

                    TOROS (CONT'D)

Toros is about to explode. He looks into the main section of
the restaurant and has an idea.

                    ALEKS
          Yeah well, I don't know either so
          can you guys please... you going to

Toros turns to Ani.

Ani shrugs.

                Here.

      Garnik, opens his phone and passes it to Toros. Garnik looks
      at Ivan's Instagram account.

                          TOROS
                If we looked at his fucking
                Instagram we would have known this
                shit two weeks ago.

      He choses the first photo. It's a photo of Ani and Ivan. He
      zooms past Ani to enlarge Ivan's face. He storms out of the
      kitchen into the main room.


124   INT. TATIANA'S GRILL - MAIN AREA - CONTINUOUS            124

      He swiftly walks across the room and grabs the mic out of the

                          TOROS
                Everybody. Listen up.

                 Yeah, she left my ass the minute we
                 got back from Vegas. And you know
                 why? `Cause she said I'd never
                 propose to her the way Ivan
                 proposed to you. Can you believe
                 that shit? And the thing is... I
                 would. I would have. I'm actually
                 like a romantic, you know.

       Ani is not listening.


125    EXT. BOARDWALK - LATE AFTERNOON                          125

       They exit Tatiana's.

                           TOROS
                 Goddamn it!

       A strong gust of cold wind blows in from the beach. The crew
       cringes.

                           TOROS (CONT'D)
                 Ok, well, let's go. No time to

                This is why we should have driven
                man. My fucking head is going to
                explode.

                          TOROS
                The cold is good for that, c'mon.

                The hell I am. It'll be dark soon.
                Move.

      Toros leads the crew down the boardwalk.


126   EXT. BRIGHTON BEACH/CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - MINUTES LATER

      The crew march through the cold. Ani is shivering. Igor
      reaches into his pocket and pulls out the red scarf from
      earlier.

                             IGOR
                       (to Ani)
                Hey.

      Ani is startled when she sees him holding the red scarf
      towards her.

      She stops walking.

      Igor looks down at the scarf and realizes he shouldn't answer
      that question.

                In case you had to gag me again
                motherfucker?

      Igor has no words.

                you, you piece of shit.
                Unfuckingbelievable.

      Ani storms ahead. Igor trails behind. They all walk in
      silence for a while. Quite a while. The wind is strong and
      cold. Finally...

                          ANI (CONT'D)
                Fuck it. Give it to me.

      Igor hands her the scarf. She throws it around her neck and
      continues walking.


127   EXT. WEST 10TH ST. - LATER                               127

      The crew approach the 10th St. They turn off the boardwalk
      and low and behold, the Escalade is in the middle of being
      attached to a tow truck.

                          TOROS
                No! Nooooo!

      Toros runs down the street. Garnik tries to keep up. Toros
      starts screaming at the TOW TRUCK DRIVER that is elevating
      the front of the Escalade.

                          TOROS (CONT'D)
                That's my fucking car. No! Detach
                it now!

                          TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                Can't man. Policy. Once it's
                attached, it's coming with me.

      Toros shoves the driver away from the controls.

                          TOROS
                Coming with you my ass. You're not
                taking my car. Garnik! Igor! Help
                me. We'e fucked if he takes this.
                Garnik starts arguing with the
                driver as well.
                                                           95.


                    TOROS (CONT'D)
          This isn't legal. You can't do
          this!

                    ANI
              (to Igor)
          I don't think your boss understands
          the definition of legal.

                    TOW TRUCK DRIVER
          Hey man. Don't make me call the
          police.

Ani and Igor stand on the curb watching this incident go
down.

                      TOROS
          How much?

                    TOW TRUCK DRIVER
          They'll tell you at the yard.

                    TOROS
          No, how much you want. Here. Here.
          Take it.

Toros holds out a $100 bill.

                    TOW TRUCK DRIVER
          I can't take that.

                    TOROS
          Ok, fuck you then.

Toros runs around the other side of the Escalade and jumps in
it. Turns it on, throws it into reverse and hits on the gas.

Nobody can believe what's happening. Suddenly it becomes a
tug of war between the Escalade and the tow truck. Toros is
burning rubber on the rear tires. The tow truck driver is
screaming for him to stop.

The Escalade is overpowering the tow truck and the truck's
front end starts to lift off the ground. Toros is in battle
mode.

                    TOROS (CONT'D)
          You asked for this! You're not
          taking my car.

Igor and Ani are impressed.
                                                                 96.


      The Escalade's front hits the ground and tears off the
      attachment, taking some of the front bumper with it. The
      front of the tow truck slams to the ground. Boom!

      Toros opens the door because lowering the window would take
      too much time.

                          TOROS (CONT'D)
                C'mon! Get in the fucking car! Get
                in!

      Garnik, Igor and Ani run to the Escalade and jump in. Toros
      throws it into Drive. He swerves over the sidewalk, hits a
      trash can and back on to the street. He tears down 12th St.


128   INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS                                  128

      They fly under the subway tracks. Toros checks the rear view.
      He starts to laugh in triumph.

                          TOROS
                Nothing is going to stop me! I'm
                going to find Ivan if it kills one
                of us.

      They fly up onto the Belt Parkway.


129   EXT. BELT PARKWAY - DUSK                                    129

      We watch them traveling laterally next to the Escalade.

                          TOROS
                We are going to find this fucker if
                it takes all fucking night.

      He speeds off into the last moments of the sunset.


130   I/E. BRIGHTON BEACH RESTAURANTS - NIGHT                     130

      The next section plays out as a montage as the crew scours
      Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay for Ivan.

      The crew hits restaurants (Varenichnaya, Ocean View, etc.),
      bars (Volna, Cafe Max, etc.) with interesting interactions
      with staff and regulars as they ask if anyone has seen Ivan.
      Toros shows the Insta photo to everybody. No luck.

       coat.

132    I/E. BRIGHTON BEACH - NIGHT                                 132

       The crew hits all the major Russian restaurants bothering
       people while they're eating. One manager tells them that Ivan
       ate there an hour ago. Toros gets hopeful.


A133   INT. RUSSIAN BATH HOUSE -    NIGHT                      A133

       The crew enter and show the photo to the customers. No luck.

       They continue the search. They hit an internet cafe first. No
       luck.
                                                                98.


      Barely functioning, Garnik waits in the car as the Toros, Ani
      and Igor explore more establishments including a billiards
      hall.


136   INT. ESCALADE - NIGHT                                      136

      They continue the hunt. Suddenly out of nowhere, Garnik
      vomits. He then cups his mouth and continues to vomit,
      causing it to spray.

                          TOROS
                No!!!!

137   WIDE EXTERIOR.                                             137

      Toros slams on the brakes. The cars behind the escalade slam
      on their brakes. Blaring horns and screaming obscenities.
      Toros pulls to the side of the road. Garnik is wallowing in
      pain. Igor and Ani are both amused and disgusted.

                                                         CUT TO:


138   EXT. BROOKLYN GAS STATION - NIGHT                          138

      Garnik leans on the car as Toros cleans the interior.

                          TOROS
                What did you give him, goddamn it!

                           IGOR
                (Russian)
                He vomited because he has a
                concussion, not because of
                Oxycodone.

      Toros notices Ani and Igor are having a smoke right next to
      the gas pump.

                          TOROS
                Honestly... with how this day has
                been going... get the fuck outta
                here!

      They walk away from the pumps. Igor attempts small talk but
      mostly it is silent and awkward. They snub out their smoke.
                                                              99.


139   INT. ESCALADE - NIGHT                                    139

      Toros is fuming, Garnik is holding his head, looking quite
      sick.

      Ani and Igor are exhausted.

                          TOROS
                Clubs should be opening now. Which

140   EXT. BRIGHTON BEACH - VARIOUS CLUBS - NIGHT              140

      The search continues. Toros shoves his bright phone in
      people's faces. He shows the photos to managers, bouncers and
      bartenders.

                          TOROS
                See this guy? Has he been here
                tonight?

                          BOUNCER
                Yeah, he was here. We cut him off
                about an hour ago.

      This happens at every bar/club they hit. It seems they are
      just missing Ivan, sometimes by minutes. They are one step
      behind him.

                    (Russian)
                He's doing a crawl. He's on a
                bender.

      Ultimately no luck. It's been a long night. Everyone looks
      like shit. Garnik has gotten higher and higher as the hours
      pass.

      The camera moves up the hallway of HQ. We reveal that it is
      Ivan, clearly very drunk and wearing sunglasses. He walks
      down the long hallway toward the main room. A red neon HQ
      sign hangs above a victorian couch at the entrance of the
      room. Diamond and JENNY (21) smile and say hello to Ivan as
      he passes. Diamond recognizes him and looks at Jenny.

                                                               155.1

        Toros grabs Ivan by the collar and drags him out.

                            TOROS
                      (Russian)
                  Run and I'll sic him on you.

        Ani can't just leave like this.

                             ANI
                  Wait. Ivan. I love you and you love
                  me. Right?

        Toros points to Igor.

                            TOROS
                      (Russian)
                  And trust me, you don't want that.
                      (English)
                  You do this to your family... and
                  me... and then just go on a bender?
                  Disgraceful.

        They exit the room and begin walking out of the club. Diamond
        trails behind them throwing insults at Ani.

                            DIAMOND
                  This is crazy funny. You in here
                  braggin', all proud... playing high
                  and mighty like your shit don't
                  stink. Look at you now bitch.

        The crew led by Toros is escorting drunk Ivan out of the
        club. Jimmy and run down the stairs.


155.2   INT. HEADQUARTERS - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS                155.2

        Ani follows followed by Igor and Garnik. They make it down
        the stairs. Diamond is stalking them hard, pushing past
        Garnik.

                             DIAMOND
                  And guess what bitch... he told me
                  he was going back to Russia
                  tomorrow and he just wanted one
                  last bang!

        If Ani is fazed by this, it doesn't show.
                                                               111.


                            GARNIK
                  Don't fuck with her.

        Garnik points to his broken nose. Diamond doesn't back down.

                            DIAMOND
                  Come back here again without these
                  fucks and you won't be leaving.

        Igor tries to diffuse the situation.

                               IGOR
                  Ok, ok.


155.3   INT. HEADQUARTERS - MAIN FLOOR / FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
                                                               155.3

        Ani continues to march ahead. They make it on to the main
        floor... almost to the front entrance. Jimmy and Dawn are
        trailing.

                            DIAMOND
                  And looks like I called it, don't
                  it?

        Ani slows down.

                            DIAMOND (CONT'D)
                  Two weeks on the fucking nose.

        Ani turns and... explodes. She swings and charges Diamond.
        Igor tries to intercept but Ani is too fast. Ani tackles
        Diamond and their bodies hit the floor. Toros holds on to
        Ivan for dear life. Everybody tries to stop the fight making
        the moment even more chaotic. Full on brawl. Igor, Garnik,
        Jimmy, Dawn and a security guard are doing their best to stop
        it. Some girls are coming to Diamond's defense while Lulu and
        others defend Ani. Punches and kicks. A table is pushed over,
        glasses shattering on the floor.

        In the back lap dance area, three topless dances including
        Sunny react to the noise.

        Back on the floor...

                            JIMMY
                  Cut it! Eddie! Cut it!

        The music stops... now just the sounds of screaming and
        swearing. Jimmy has had enough of this drama in his club.
                                                              112.


                              JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Out of here now! I don't care if
                    you take it outside but get out of
                    here.

       Finally Igor pulls the kicking and screaming Ani off Diamond
       and drags her out the door.


A156   EXT. HEADQUARTERS - 552 W. 38TH ST. - NIGHT             A156

       They load into the Escalade. Toros shoves Ivan in the back
       between Garnik and Igor. He turns and shoves the Ani in
       front.


B156   INT. ESCALADE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                      B156

                              TOROS
                    We got you, we got you, we got you.

       Ani, still trying to calm herself down, turns and tries to
       talk sense in to Ivan to no avail.

                              ANI
                    Vanya! You have to listen to me
                    right now. They are trying to get
                    us divorced. Do you understand what
                    is happening?

       No response from Ivan.

                              ANI (CONT'D)
                    Pull over. Ivan and I aren't
                    finished talking.

                              TOROS
                    You can talk at the courthouse.

                              ANI
                    That wasn't the deal.

                               TOROS
                    The deal is that you get 10K and
                    walk away and that's what's
                    happening.

                              ANI
                    Vanya! Do you hear him? They want
                    me to take money to leave you!

       No answer.
                                                       113.


                    ANI (CONT'D)
          Vanya!

                    GARMIK
          Oh my god. Will someone shut her
          up.

                    ANI
          Vanya!

                    IGOR
          He's passed out. He doesn't hear
          you.

                    ANI
          This wasn't the deal. Vanya doesn't
          know what's happening.

                    TOROS
          Yes he does. He knows he fucked up.
          He knows he's going back to Russia.
          We wouldn't have had to chase him
          all night if he didn't know that.

                    ANI
          He's scared.

                    TOROS
          Yes! He should be. And when the
          judge asks him if he wants an
          annulment, he'll say yes... because
          if he doesn't, his father cuts him
          off.

                    ANI
          You motherfucker. This isn't fair.

                    TOROS
          Life isn't fair.

Ani screams in frustration and pounds the dashboard. Igor
leans forward, around the right of the headrest.

                    GARNIK
          Can we go home now?

                     TOROS
          No, we're staying here in
          Manhattan.

Ani is silent, calculating her next move, while they drive
through the city. Toros continues to chastise Ivan.
                                                               114.


                          TOROS (CONT'D)
                You really must hate me. Really.
                And that is sad to me. Because I
                let you get away with so much shit
                over the years. Bailed you out
                countless times. But I thought you
                finally grew up.




156   EXT. COURTHOUSE - CENTER STREET - NIGHT                    156

      The Escalade parks in front. Toros throws it into park and
      settles back.

                          TOROS
                Now we wait.

      Ani looks lost as she stares out the window. Igor is aware of
      Ani's state.


157   EXT. COURTHOUSE - CENTER STREET - MORNING                  157

                          TOROS
                Ok, c'mon. Wake up. There he is.

      Ani is wide awake. Igor and Garnik begin to stir. Ivan
      doesn't.

                          TOROS (CONT'D)
                Ok, c'mon. Wake up. There he is.
                Let's go!

      Toros gets out of the Escalade. Ani turns to Ivan who is
      still quite intoxicated.

                          ANI
                Don't worry, I'm going to handle
                this.


158   EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                      158

      Toros is shoving Garnik in the front seat of the Escalade.

                          TOROS
                Do not get a ticket, do not get
                towed, do not fall asleep. Keep
                your phone on. Hear me?

      Toros motions for the crew to walk up the steps of the
      courthouse where MICHAEL SHARNOV (late 40's), the NYC family
      lawyer greets them.

                          SHARNOV
                Good morning everyone. Ok, the
                judge is being very kind and bumped
                us up... Hello Ivan.

      Ivan doesn't acknowledge.

                    (Russian)
                Ivan. It's Michael Sharnov, your
                father's attorney. Remember me?

                          TOROS
                He's tired.

                          SHARNOV
                I see.
                    (to Ani)

                The lucky lady.

                          SHARNOV
                I see. And who is this?

      Sharnov points to Igor.

                          TOROS
                We may need him.

                          SHARNOV
                Ok, not sure what that means and
                don't want to know. Let's go. Get
                your ID's ready.


159   INT. COURTHOUSE - ROTUNDA - DAY                          159

      They look like quite the motley crew as they walk through the
      rotunda.

                          SHARNOV
                    (Russian)
                I talked to him. I know he wants
                this done. But does he know that
                his son is inebriated?
                                                             116.


                          TOROS
                    (Russian)
                He's not inebriated. He just woke
                up.

                          SHARNOV
                Toros please. C'mon man. I can't
                risk losing my license...

                          TOROS
                I repeat... do you want to continue
                working for the Zakharov family, or
                not?

                          SHARNOV
                Why do I agree to this shit. C'mon.


160   INT. COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - LATER                      160

      The crew walks in to the courtroom and settles in front of
      the judge's bench.

                          JUDGE
                Ok Mr. Sharnov. Consider yourself

                and...

      Sharnov looks at Ani's ID.

                ...Anora Mikheyova married on...

      He looks at the marriage license.

                ...January 10th...

      several times.

          profanity again and you'll all be
          charged with disorderly conduct.
          Mr. Sharnov, what's going on?

          Your honor...

                    ANI
          This is bullshit. My husband and I
          do not agree to this annulment. It
          is being forced upon us...

                    TOROS
          Shut up! She does agree. Get her
          out of here.

          Me and my husband, who is clearly
          intoxicated and unable to make an
          informed decision, are being forced
          by these men to annul our
          legitimate marriage.

                    TOROS
          She's drunk and doesn't know what
          she's saying.

                    JUDGE
          Ok, order in the court.

                    ANI
          I'm not drunk... we were legally
          married at a legitimate marriage
          center in Las Vegas and have the
          license to prove it. Neither me nor
          my husband will be signing
          anything.

Sharnov does a double take.

                    SHARNOV
          They got married in Nevada?

He looks down at the license and sees the State of Nevada
seal.

                      TOROS
          Yeah, so?
                                                             118.

                So?

                Mr. Sharnov, you and your clients
                will be escorted from this
                courtroom...

                Yes, your honor. No problem. Just a
                second your honor.

      Sharnov turns to Toros again and speaks to Toros in Russian.

                          SHARNOV
                    (Russian)
                They got married in Nevada. This is
                New York.

                            TOROS

                          SHARNOV
                    (Russian)

       On the front steps, the freaking out continues. Toros makes a
       scene.

                           TOROS
                 Why the fuck did you get married in
                 Vegas? Couldn't you have gotten
                 married here?

                 We were in Vegas when we decided
                 to. When Ivan fucking proposed to

                 They're landing in two hours.My
                 heart. I honestly think I'm going
                 to have a heart attack.

       Toros sits down on the steps of the courthouse. He holds his
       head and weeps.


A163   EXT. TORO'S ESCALADE - DAY                              A163

       Toros opens the front door and tears Garnik out of the front
       seat.

       The crew piles in and Toros drives away.

       Suddenly Ivan starts vomiting on himself. Igor and Garnik
       start to freak out. Toros barely reacts.

      The Zakharov private jet lands. Toros walks onto the tarmac
      to greet them. They are walking down the boarding stairs. Two
      customs agents approach with a customs sniffer dog.

      They are mid-flight. The interior of the plane is lavish and
      gaudy. There are two seating areas, a food and drink area and
      a couch facing a wide screen TV. Russian news plays on the
      TV.

      Ivan and his parents are seated on one side of the plane. Ani
      and Igor are seated on the couch in the rear. Toros sits
      across from Garnik on the other side.

      It's been a long night and the crew is looking spent.

                          IGOR

      In the front, Ivan's parents will not let up from
      reprimanding him. He tries to defend himself but he spirals
      into drunken nonsense.

      Toros tries to interject at some point, which only causes
      tensions to flare.

      Igor stares at the bar. He goes over and pours two shots of
      vodka. He returns and hands her one. She takes it. Igor lifts
      his glass to toast. Too late, Ani does the shot. She turns to
      see him holding the shot glass in the air.

          Toros and I over the years...

The family dismisses him in disgust.

          Shut up. Why are you drinking?
              (under his breath)

          Go.

Garnik stumbles to the back.

He plants himself on the couch next to Ani and Igor.

                    GARNIK
          I understand and forgive you for
          what you did.

                    ANI
          Ok great. I'm so grateful for your
          forgiveness.

Garnik lays his head down on the couch and is asleep in
seconds.

Igor and Ani have a back and forth that is aggressive, yet
has a playful undercurrent.

In the front of the plane, the argument has reached its peak.
Ivan is crying.

                    IVAN

          we're going to fix it so come   on,
          stop. Jesus.

This is too much for Ani to bear. She stands and gestures
toward Ivan on the other side of the plane.

      Everybody piles into the small office. The receptionist is
      taken aback by the amount of people. The ATTORNEY greets them
      and starts the annulment process.

      Garnik is asleep on a chair in the corner.

      Ivan does not think twice when asked to sign the papers.

      Ani is disgusted. She steps forward.

                Wait, is that my scarf?

      Ani looks down at the scarf and slowly   slides it off her neck
      in a taunting way. She drops it to the   floor. Toros reaches
      down and picks it up for Galina as Ani   and Igor exit the
      room. Ani then takes off her Sable and   throws it on Ivan's
      head. She then exits.

      Ani takes the designer sunglasses out of her coat and puts
      them on.

      Toros walks them to one of the SUVs. As Ani and Igor get in
      the SUV, Toros gives instructions to the driver and hands
      Igor key car and bank card.

                          TOROS
                Take them to Harry Reid, domestic
                flights.

      He looks to the backseat.

                Igor is going to take you back. You
                can stay at the house tonight but
                you need to be out in the morning.
                Igor will get your money when the

      gets him aroused and sits down on him and rides him. He is
      confused and concerned yet allows it to happen.

      Suddenly she explodes and begins punching and slapping his
      face. He is completely taken by surprise. Ani lands a shot or
      two as he scrambles to block her pounding fists. Ani screams
      as she pounds away. Finally Igor gets hold of her hands and
      subdues her. He holds her wrists so she cannot continue
      swinging.

                           IGOR (CONT'D)
                     (Russian)
                 Stop! Stop! Just fucking stop! What
                 is wrong with you!

      Ani begins to sob and collapses on him. He holds her as she
      cries.

      The snow continues to fall around the idling car.
