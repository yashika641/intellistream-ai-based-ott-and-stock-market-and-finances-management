    INT. SHIFTERS NITECLUB

    FLORA (30) and KATHY (30s) dance like crazy in a mob of
    dancers. Sweat, estrogen, and alcohol.

    It's a terrible nightclub. For some of it, Flora and Kathy
    have their shoes off, and dance together barefoot. They are
    doing synchronized moves that they always do at Shifters. *
    People watch on, clapping.

    A MAN (35), with a mustache keeps dancing really close to
    her. At the start of the night, she keeps her distance,
    physically indicating she has no interest, looking out for
    something better.

    But everyone's taken. We see her starting a conversation with
    a HANDSOME GUY (20). The conversation tails off as his
    PRETTY, YOUNG GIRLFRIEND (19), returns from the bathroom.
    Flora gives up and slouches off.

    INT. SHIFTERS NITECLUB - LATER

    The MUSTACHE man perseveres as shots are cons umed, one after
    another. Insinuating himself into their vibe.

                        KEV
                   (shouting)
              I'm Kev!

                        FLORA
                   (shouting)
              Flora.

                        KEV
                   (shouting)
              I'll be riding you later.

                        FLORA
                   (shouting)
              No you wont.

    By the end of the night, Flora is passively getting off with
    him.

                                                 SLOW DISSOLVE
                                                           TO:

    INT. FLORA'S TINY BEDROOM - MORNING

    Flora wakes up in her bed, slowly coming around. She suddenly
    jerks a hand across the other side of the bed, feel ing
    around. It's empty.
                                                             2.


                        FLORA
                   (relieved)
              Oh, good girl, Flora.

    She yawns. She looks absolutely wrecked. Then Kev reenters
    from the bathroom, pulling up his shorts.

                         KEV
              Mornin.

                         FLORA
              Oh fuck!

    INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

    Flora has given Kev breakfast. She sits across from him with
    a coffee and a cigarette. She checks her watch, kind of
    waiting for him to finish.

                        KEV
              Why aren't you having a breakfast?

                        FLORA
              I feel sick. That was too much last
              night.

                        KEV
              Yeah. Good craic though. So do you
              go to Shifters a lot, love?

                        FLORA
              Yeah. All me life. Great club.

                        KEV
              Yeah! Do you have any toast?

                         FLORA
              No.

                        KEV
              You don't have any bread in the
              house?

                        FLORA
              No. Me son eats it all.

                        KEV
              There's a son??

                         FLORA
              Yeah.
                                                3.


                    KEV
          Where is he?

                    FLORA
          I don't know. He's supposed to be
          in school. But he could be
          anywhere. I told you all about this
          last night in the taxi? You said
          you were cool with it

He hurries up eating.

                    KEV
          Right. Yeah. A son. I'm cool with
          that.

                    FLORA
          Right. Are you sure?
               (beat)
          So do you want to meet tonight?

                      KEV
                 (goes to shake his head)
          Yes.

She is enjoying this.

                    FLORA
          Brilliant. Cause I really like you.
          We had a re ally natural connection
          last night.

                    KEV
          We defo did.

                    FLORA
          And I think you're a very
          responsible sort of bloke.

                    KEV
          Yeah.
          This is brilliant. It's just what I
          needed in me life. A sense of
          direction. Or purpose. Do you know
          what I mean?

                    FLORA
          Cool. So, I'll see you tonight
          then? Will you pick me up?

                    MAN
          Yeah. Look, Flora, I'm just not
          sure that I'm the right guy for
          this.

                        MAN (CONT'D)
              Maybe I wouldn't know where to
              begin looking after a kid. I'm
              basically a big kid meself. At
              work, they call me... Kev, the Kid.

                        FLORA
              I'm pulling your fucking leg, you
              dope!

                        MAN
              Oh. Thank God! Sorry.

                          FLORA
              Gotcha!

    They both laugh.

                        MAN
              Phew! That was weird. I better get
              to work, I'm late.

                        FLORA
              Fair enough.

                        MAN
              Thanks for the breakfast. I wasn't
              expecting that.

    He puts his stuff in the sink. And she opens the door. He
    passes her, putting on his coat.

    He has to pass quite close in the doorway. It is a hellish
    moment of awkwardness. He kisses her on the cheek.

    He exits hurriedly.

    INT. FLORA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

    Flora and MAX (13) sit on the couch. The Guard sits on an
    armchair across from them. He has a cup of tea and a plate of
    hobnobs on his knee, and Max's file in front of him. It's a
    bit of a balanci ng act. The TV is on directly behind him with
    the sound down. Max tries to watch the football on it without
    the guard noticing.

                        GUARD
              Now. Have you committed any
              antisocial behavior in the last
              three months of your life?

                        MAX
              No way Guard.
                                                   5.


                       GUARD
             Have you received any stolen goods,
             to the best of your knowledge?

                       MAX
             Not I, Guard.

                       GUARD
             Have you stolen any goods.

                       MAX
             Not that I got caught with.

Flora punches his arm really hard.

                         MAX (CONT'D)
             Ow! Fuck!

                       FLORA
             Answer him properly, you fucking
             idiot.

                       GUARD
             How did you get the black eye?

                         MAX
             Her!

He gestures to Flora.

                         FLORA
             Fuck off!

                       MAX
             Nah. Just fighting.

The Guard and Flora exchange looks.

                       GUARD
             Did you think about jo ining the
             boxing club, Max?

                       MAX
             They only wanted me to clean up,
             and mop spit off the floor. I'm not
             doing that.

                       GUARD
             That's how Rocky started.

Max sighs.
                                                           6.


                    GUARD (CONT'D)
          What about football? Weren't you a
          mean little striker back in primary
          school?

                       MAX
          No.

He looks to the mother.

                       FLORA
          He wasn't.

                    GUARD
          They have a cycling group, in Mount
          Vernon, taking trips out to the
          Dublin Mountains every weekend. Get
          you fit. See the countryside?

                    MAX
          I don't have a bike.

                    FLORA
          He sold it for a second hand
          laptop. So he could play video
          games.

                     MAX
          That's not all I do on it. I watch
          bl ues on it too.


She sighs, biting her nails. The Guard is at a loss.

                    GUARD
          The Juvenile liaison program is
          designed to keep young kids out of
          the court system Max, and so out of
          prison. Do you know what they do to
          pretty, young lads like you in
          prison?


They all know what he is suggesting. Need he go further?

                    GUARD (CONT'D)
          They anally rape them, Max.

He gets up to go, gathering his files, and a few biscuits.

                        GUARD (CONT'D)
              But I warn you now, you're headed
              in that direction. A string of
              offense the length of my arm.

    INT. AISHLING'S LARGE HOUSE - MORNING

    Flora sits at a grand piano in a lovely drawing room. She is
    bouncing a 17 month baby on her knee. She plinks a couple of
    keys, encouraging the baby to copy her. But the baby seems
    more interested to sit on the keys. Then climb on top of the
    piano and knock ov er photographs. And then get chocolate from
    her fingers on the keys.

    Flora tries to distract the child by doing a "SHARK" noise on
    the bass keys, and a "MOUSE" noice on the plinky top keys.

    It's a valiant effort. It's not working.

    AISHLING, the baby's mother, bounces in. She is 40, wearing
    some high-end yoga gear, after a work-out. Flora happily
    hands the baby to her mother, who coos.

                         AISHLING
              Yikes , look at you, big chocolate
              mouth.

                        FLORA
              Oh, sorry. She found one in the
              kitchen.

                        AISHLING
              No worries.

                        FLORA
              How was your work out?

                        AISHLING
              Amazing. How am I doing?

    She pulls a profile, pats her abs.

                        FLORA
              You look amazing.

                        AISLING
              Yay! Okay Flora. You're free to go.
              Thanks.

    Aishling hands her two fifty euro notes.
                                                             8.


                        FLORA
              Thanks Aishling. See you Monday.
              See ya Sorcha.

                        AISHLING
              Could you get here on time? Just
              knocks her nap off, if I don't get
              her down.

                        FLORA
              Yeah. Of course. Sorry.

    INT. AISHLING'S LARGE HOUSE. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

    Flora puts her shoes and jacket on in the hallway, as
    Aishling and the baby play, off. As she does so, she notices
    Aishling's purse on the hall table. An envelope with numerous
    twenti es. She tops her wages up with a twenty, and hurries
    off.

                           FLORA
              Bye now.

                         AISHLING
                   (off)
              Thanks for everything.

                           FLORA
              Thank you!

    EXT. AISHLING'S LARGE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

    Flora walks down the steps of a big house, past a fleet of
    SUV's charging, and walks down the street.

9                                                                 9
    EXT. A LEAFY STREET - LATER

    A skip is parked outside a house, which has just been sold.
    Two burley workmen load it with it broken plaste r, bags of
    old clothes and old suitcases. Protruding from the skip-full
    of bric-�-brac, the neck of a guitar case. Flora regards it
    as she passes. Then pauses. Circles back out of curiosity.

    She hoists herself up onto the skip, brushing plaster and
    dust of her knees. She grips the neck of the case, and pulls
    it out in a cloud of plaster smoke and dust. She opens the
    old case. Inside, is a smaller than average, beginners
    guitar. It's scratched and has just one string, and missing
    frets.

    She lets it drop back in, climbs down, and walks off.
                                                                 9.


     Hold on the empty frame.

     She returns and pulls it back out.

10                                                                 10
     INT. A BUS - LATER

     Flora sits on the bus listening to headphones. On the seat
     beside her, is the guitar. We hear the hard kick drum of
     repetitive dance music from her headphones.

     The bus travels into a rougher suburb of Dublin. A THUG
     smokes under a no smoking sign, blowing smoke towards the
     open window.

     Flora turns to him, as if to admoni sh him. He looks at her
     with dead eyes.

                         FLORA
               Give us one of them, will ya?

                          THUG
               No

     She shrugs.

     Flora gets off at her stop.

11                                                                 11
     INT. A SMALL LOCAL MUSIC SHOP - AFTERNOON

     Flora enters a tiny local music shop. Threadbare carpets,
     very little stock, bored youngster in his teens behind a
     counter reading texts.

                         FLORA
               Hiya. How much is this family
               heirloom worth? I'm not sure I'm
               selling it- I just wanted to get i t
               valueatded.


     She puts the guitar on the counter. The teenager opens the
     bag. Looks at it. Looks at the label in the hole. Checks the
     neck like looking down a gun-sight, turns it over, sets it
     down.

                         TEENAGER
               The bridge is cracked. The neck is
               warped. Two of the machine heads
               are broken. Half the frets are
               missing.
                                                           10.


                    FLORA
          Right, well, I'll give it to you
          for a hundred then.

                      TEENAGER
          Yeah, no.

                    FLORA
          It's probably vintage and you just
          can't see it with your untrained
          eye. It's your loss. There are
          loads of music shops in this
          neighborhood?

                    TEENAGER
          No there aren't. There's literally
          one.

She is disappointed, but not surprised. She stands there
thinking about what to do with it.

                    FLORA
          Can I leave it here?

                     TEENAGER
          You'd hav e to pay me to take it.
          You were technically better off
          before you robbed this guitar.

                    FLORA
               (not really offended)
          How dare you.

She grabs it and goes to exit. Stops at the door. Circles
back.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          So how much to clean it up, fix the
          neck, and put strings on it?

                    TEENAGER
          Why would you do that? That would
          be like putting Range Rover wheels
          on a Yaris.

                    FLORA
          Who are you, fucking Jeremy
          Clarkson?

                     TEENAGER
          I do n't want to take your money.
                                                              11.


                         FLORA
               I have a son. And his da used to be
               in a band. Maybe it's in the blood.

                           TEENAGER
               Right.

                         FLORA
               Plus it's his birthday.

     He looks at the guitar again.

                         TEENAGER
               Let's see. Tighten the truss rod,
               set of strings, two new machine
               heads.

                         TEENAGER (CONT'D)
               Sixty Euro?

                           FLORA
               Fuck off.

                           TEENAGER
               18 euro.

     She checks her purse. Counts. Takes the note she stole
     earlier. Thinks.

                           FLORA
               Do it.

12                                                                12
     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

     Fl ora walks across the forecourt of a lively housing complex
     in a tough area. She is carrying the guitar. She has a couple
     of bags of shopping. It's a bit of a slog.

     She heads up the steps towards her flat. She opens up and
     enters.

                           FLORA
               Max?!

13                                                                13
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     Flora is in a tiny kitchen. She takes the shopping out and
     stows it. Milk. Spaghetti. Washing up liquid. Baked beans.

     She goes out and re-enters with the guitar. She takes it out
     of the case puts it on the kitchen table.
                                                                12.


     She takes a red bow off a box of chocolates with a bread
     knife. She eats the last chocolate.

     She wraps the ribbon around the fret board of the guitar.
     Then she sits it up on a chair in the corner of the room.
     Strums it.

     She sits down at the table. Lights a cigarette. Looks at the
     guitar again. Checks her watch. Smokes. Pours a glass of
     white wine.

14                                                                14
     INT. FLORA'S HALLWAY - LATER

     The hall door opens a nd Max, enters. Throws his jacket on the
     banister.

15                                                                15
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Max looks into the kitchen, but not entering, more to see if
     his mum's home. He has a BLACK EYE.

                            FLORA
                       (over her shoulder)
               Hiya.

     He nods, is just about to exit when he sees the guitar.

                         MAX
               What's that.

                         FLORA
               It's a piano.

                         MAX
               Who's is it?

     He steps in, hanging around.

                         FLORA
               Well let's see now. How many kids
               do I have? Wait now- one. It's
               yours! What happened your eye?

                         MAX
               I tried to rob something and got a
               beating.

                            FLORA
               Oh.

                         MAX
               Where did you get it?
                                      13.


          FLORA
What does that matter?

          MAX
Did you find it or something?

          FLORA
Who cares where it came from? It's
a guitar. It makes music. Do you
like it? You used to be dead into
music. Happy birthday.

          MAX
     (smiling)
You fucking robbed it, didn't you?
From one of the houses?

          FLORA
No I didn't rob it. Play it.

          MAX
I don't want to play it.

           FLORA
Why not?

          MAX
Since when am I a guitarist?

           FLORA
Since now. Believe in better.
Imp ossible is nothing, or
something.

          MAX
Jesus. You didn't even buy it for
me.

          FLORA
How do you know? Maybe I did!

          MAX
Well did you?

          FLORA
No. But why does that even matter?

          MAX
You never get me anything. My whole
life. And then you come home with
this dusty piece of shit the DAY
AFTER ME BIRTHDAY, and expect me to
turn into Ed fucking Sheerin?
                                                         14.


                    FLORA
          Was yesterday your birthday?? It's
          a gift! Who cares.

                    MAX
          I don't want it. It's a crock of
          fucking shit.

                    FLORA
          You ungrateful prick.

                    MAX
          And you are a daft slag who never
          gave anyone anything.

                    FLORA
          Don't talk to me like that you
          little prick.

                    MAX
          Cunt.

Suddenly, she boxes him in the face. Grabs him by the collar
and slaps him twice.

                    FLORA
          You came out of my cunt, you
          ungrateful little animal.

                    MAX
          One day, I'm going to surprise you
          and smash into your fucking face.

                    FLORA
          You'll be behind bars before that.

                    MAX
          Good! Away from you!

                    FLORA
          Go on, go back to your da. I can't
          wait for the weekend!

He slams door. She throws her glass at the door behind him.
The front door slams.

She sits there, raging. Looks at the guitar. Then launches
towards it, picking it up. Opens the window. Which is jammed.
Wrestles it ope n. Goes to throw the guitar out. But it is too
big to go through the tiny window. She starts screaming,
forcing the thing out.

It won't go. She gives up. She throws it behind the armchair
into the corner. Stands there, breathless.
                                                                15.

     EXT. A HOUSING COMPLEX - DAY

     Flora walks up a road in a run down housing complex. Max
     walks behind, small rucksack over shoulder, headphones on.
     She also has her headphones on. Flora turns into a block of
     small houses. She surreptitiously applies lipstick in the
     wing mirror of a parked car. Checks her look.

     They turn into one house and ring the bell.

     The door o pens and IAN (35), stands there. Ian wears a few
     tattoos, a bathrobe and slippers. Very good looking. Conor
     McGregor beard.

                          IAN
               Flora.

                          FLORA
               Ian.

     They both wait for Max to saunter past and into the house.
     Ian wraps a wiry bicep around his neck affectionately, but a
     little roughly.

                          MAX
               Hi dad.

                         IAN
               Hey little man. I'm in the
               Lamborghini.


     Max enters the house, firing up the play station, off.

                         IAN (CONT'D)
               I heard about the guitar episode.

     Ian is smiling to himself. Kind of enjoying her failure.

                         IAN (CONT'D)
               So you thought you had a little
               Harry Styles in the family, did
               you?


     Laughs.
                                                16.


                    FLORA
          God knows what he could be. I mean
          look at the genes. (meaning him)

                    IAN
          It's not about genes. It's about
          dreams. I sacrificed all my music
          dreams for him. And you. You're
          welcome.

                    FLORA
          Here we go.

                    IAN
          You do know we were on the same
          bill as Snow Patrol the night I met
          you?

                    FLORA
          Of course I did. It's why I fucked
          you.

                    IAN
          God knows where I could be now if
          things hadda been different.

                    FLORA
          Mountjoy. Por tlaoise. Cloverhill.
          Pick a prison.

                    IAN
          Okay. You'd better go- they'll
          clamp your broomstick. See you on
          Monday Flora. Can't wait.


He turns to go.

                    FLORA
          Anyway, I might learn the guitar
          myself.

                    IAN
          Okay.

                    FLORA
          Yeah. I was thinking about it.

                    IAN
          Were you drinking a lot of Vino-
          Rioja when you were thinking about
          it?
                                                17.


                    FLORA
               (mocking)
          Could be you're not the only genius
          in this family!

                    IAN
          Sorry, but YOU playing guitar is
          just too funny.

                       FLORA
          Why?

                    IAN
          Because it takes discipline, Flora.
          Years of practice and sweat and
          commitment. Not just some overnight
          transformation in some reality TV
          show. These callouses took twenty
          years to form.

                    FLORA
          Are you really going to talk to me
          about commitment??


He says nothing. Point take n.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          Where is she? At a nail bar getting
          a manicure? Or at the surgery
          getting a Brazilian arse lift?

                    IAN
          She doesn't need one.

Flora breathes fire.

                    FLORA
          You're disgusting.

She turns and goes, as if she's won this.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          And don't just sit on the couch
          smoking weed and playing video
          games. Do stuff with him. He's got
          loads of energy.


Ian goes to shut the door.

                     FLORA (CONT'D)
          And her arse isn't that amazing.
          Ju st FYI.
                                                              18.


                         IAN
               Okay Flora.

     He closes the door.

17                                                                17
     EXT. THE PATH - CONTINUOUS

     Flora exits the gate as a white BMW coupe pulls up. JUANITA
     (28), gets out with some bags of shopping and zaps her alarm,
     crossing to the same house. She is dressed in a pink yoga
     outfit. Her breasts and buttocks appear to defy gravity.

     Flora stares daggers. This is terrible timing.

                         JUANITA
               Oh hey... Flora.

                           FLORA
               Juanita.

                         JUANITA
                    (Ala teenager )
               Awkward.

                         FLORA
               Not for me. I've been there. You're
               welcome to him.

                         JUANITA
               Thank you! Better go in. I need a
               shower after training. Hasta Luego.


     Juanita heads in. As she walks, Flora checks out her arse. It
     is fairly amazing. Even she is amazed.

                         FLORA
                    (Sotto voce)
               Fucking hell.

18                                                                18
     EXT. THE BOARDWALK - DAY

     Flora is sitting on a bench on the boardwalk in the sun by
     the river Liffey. With her is Cathy.

     SHANIA , (2) is playing between them. Or whatever the hell she
     decides to do on the day. They are both drinking take out
     teas. They are bored.

                         FLORA
               I can't go on like this.
                                      19.


          CATHY
Okay let's go?

          FLORA
No, I mean in life.

             CATHY
Oh.

          FLORA
I've nothing to look forward to.

          CATHY
Yeah you have!

             FLORA
Like what?

          CATHY
     (thinks)
The next season of Dahmer?

          FLORA
All I've got to keep me sane is the
idea that that little prick will be
18 one day, and move out. And then
what?

          CATHY
Party central in your house!

          FLORA
I have to break out of this prison.
I even have cash saved. Do you know
that? Me esc ape money!

          CATHY
Where would you go, and can I come?

          FLORA
I don't fucking know. But in that
river soon if I don't find a way
out of this. I swear to God.

          CATHY
Please don't jump in the Liffey,
babes. (beat) It stinks. At least
go out to Dollymount and jump in
the sea.
                                                               20.


                          FLORA
               This can't be my story. Growing old
               in that shoebox, with a kid who
               hates me, and his father who
               doesn't see me. It can't be my
               narrative.

                         CATHY
               So what if he rejected your
               present? You didn't even buy it for
               him, in fairness. And you missed
               his birthday. But you're a great
               mother.

                          FLORA
               Am I? Sometimes, I watch those news
               clips. Of kids gone missing. And
               police hunts. And I feel for those
               parent s. But sometimes, I wouldn't
               mind that so much. I wouldn't want
               anything bad to happen him. But
               sometimes I'd love to come home,
               and he... just wasn't there.

                         CATHY
               Okay, I take it back, You're a
               fucking psycho.


     She gets up. She takes her baby stuffs it in the buggy.

                         CATHY (CONT'D)
               You coming to Shifters later?

                         FLORA
               Have I ever said no to that
               question.

                         CATHY
               Whoopdeedo.

     Cathy head off. We hold on Flora, looking i nto the depths of
     the Liffey!

19                                                               19
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     Flora has cleaned up and is sitting at the table smoking her
     cigarette. The place feels very empty. Checks her watch. Sits
     there some more.

     A text message comes in.

     KATHY. "Shifters?"
                                                              21.


     Flora types: "I can't. Seriously. Enjoy".

     She sends it and chucks the phone away, sitting there. Bored.

     Her eyes fall on the guitar neck, which is still lying strewn
     in the corner, behind a chair.

20                                                               20
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Flora is sitting on the chair with the guitar. She hesitantly
     picks it. Then strums it. It's out of tune. Doesn't know
     where to begin. It sounds horrible.

21                                                               21
     INT. FL ORA'S TINY KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     She is sitting at the kitchen table with an old laptop
     plugged in and open. She has typed "Tuning A Guitar" into
     Google. She finds an app.

     She tunes the guitar up. Now it is in tune.

     She strums it. Open. Tries to form a chord or two, but hasn't
     a clue. Googles.

     "Learning guitar"

     Quick cross section of very advanced guys all over the world
     soloing and playing com plex chords and generally showing off.
     There's some really funny American and Russian dudes. Brash,
     male and noisy.

     Flora re-types:

     "Learning guitar for beginners".

     That's better. A number of tiles of guys in their attics,
     basements, studios from all over the world, teaching the
     basics of guitar. She lands on a handsome man in his mid
     forties with a goatee beard, and a handsome face. He's
     holding a nice, used Martin guitar.

     She presses play. The screen comes to life. The room is an
     airy and open plan, with a view of mountains through glass
     doors. Numerous guitars hang on walls. A collection of old
     records. He takes his time. There's no rush about this guy.
     When he speaks, he has a gravelly, but soothing voice.

                         MAN
               Hello. Thanks for stopping by. So
               you've bought a guitar.

                         MAN (CONT'D)
               Or someone's gone and bought you a
               guitar, or you've inherited a
               guitar, howandever you've ended up
               here on the internet, looking to
               learn how to operate it. Well, let
               me tell you, you are about to
               embark on a relationship that's
               going to last you a lifetime. One
               of joy, of calm, of peace.

                         FLORA
               Bring it fucking on.

                         MAN
                    (beat)
               A guitar is a little like a
               bicycle. You put very little in,
               and get a hell of a lot out. That
               thing sitting on your lap in
               silence, can make you laugh, make
               you smile, make you fall in love.
               Help you grieve. Hell, it can break
               your heart if you want to let it.
               Be careful.

                         MAN (CONT'D)
               So this is by way of an
               introduction to my course. Just
               let's sit here and think about
               that. About that potential that's
               already in the room with you. So,
               hit the button, and sign up. Bye.

                         FL ORA
               Relax, will ya.

     She scrolls down the website and hovers over the ZOOM TUITION
     tile. Hour lessons cost twenty dollars.

     She thinks about it. Doesn't commit.

22                                                              22
     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

     Flora enters the complex. Various pockets of kids and
     teenagers hang around. Smaller kids play in a shitty
     playground.

     Max sits on the outskirts of a group of older teenagers, all
     wearing designer gear. The y are shooting a video on an iphone
     with a gimbal. Playback comes from a huge portable bluetooth
     speaker. KEITH (18), is mouthing into camera. He has a fake
     gun, and a balaclava.
                                                              23.


     He smokes weed, and then lets it bellow out through his
     balaclava. Points the gun at the camera etc. He is wearing a
     Gucci leather jacket and is bare-chested. White lounge pants
     and gold sneakers. Two young teenagers dressed like hookers,
     walk behind him mouthing a chorus. It's painfully generic.

                         KEITH
               "Light up like candelabra. I got
               magic. Abra Da Cabra."

     Etc.

     Max is impressed. He is fixated on on e of the girls, SAMANTHA
     (16). Utterly out of his league. Flora notices this.

                         FLORA
               Come on. It's time.

     Max saunters home after her. He waves goodbye to SAMANTHA,
     who clearly has no knowledge of his existence. She is
     obsessed with Keith. Not Max.

23                                                                23
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     Flora and Max eat pasta in silence at the small kitchen
     table. Max has his smart phone propped up against a glass,
     watchin g extreme sports clips on YouTube as he eats. A guy is
     in a Wingsuit flying.

     Flora, who has finished, sort of watches too, as she nurses a
     glass of wine.

                         FLORA
               What's that?

                         MAX
               A wing suit.

                         FLORA
               What is that?

                         MAX
               What part of WING and SUIT don't
               you understand?

                         FLORA
               Let's have a look.

     She moves in a little closer. Max shuts it down and gets up.

                         MAX
               I'm going out.
                                                24.


                    FLORA
          Where? To that lot you were with
          today?

                    MAX
          No. Over to Rhys's house. Then over
          to precinct for a bit.


She thinks.

                     FLORA
          You're not going to do some base
          jumping off some buildings or
          something?

                    MAX
          No. We don't have a GoPro anyway.

                    FLORA
          Because the last thing I want is
          the police calling here to tell me
          you've fallen off a tower block or
          something. And you're dead. And
          gone.

He just looks at her.

                    MA X
          You don't mean that, and we both
          know it. He turns to go.

                    FLORA
          Be back at nine!

                      MAX
          For what?

                    FLORA
          Because I fucking say so.

                    MAX
          I can't wait for the day I don't
          have to be here.

                    FLORA
          The only reason you're here is
          because your da wants his days off
          for his projects. Otherwise, you'd
          be with him 24/7. Trust me.

                    MAX
          Well if you don't want me here, why
          do I have to be back at 9?
                                                               25.


                         FLORA
               Don't play mind games with me. Get
               out.

24                                                               24
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - EVENING

     Flora pours a glass of wine, gets her cigarettes, ashtray and
     guitar and places herself in front of the laptop. She looks
     at the kitchen clock. 2 minutes to ten.

     On screen, the   ZOOM app comes to life, as JEFF (40s) appears.
     He adjusts his   screen. He is sitting in the same room,
     streaming with   light. A California sun, and mountains. Pretty
     romantic. He's   wearing a faded blue denim shirt. He looks
     good.

                         JEFF
               Oh hey, Flora. Are you my 2
               O'Clock?

                           FLORA
               Yeah.

                         JEFF
               How are you?

                         FLORA
               I'm alright. How are you?

                         JEFF
               Well, it's a beautiful morning here
               in Los Angeles. Sun shining. The
               smell of Eucalyptus on the breeze.
               So I can't complain.

                         FLORA
               Yeah. Lovely here in Cabra too.

                         JEFF
               So it's evening there?

                         FLORA
               No, it's just permanentl y this
               grim.

     He is surprised.

                         JEFF
               So, you wanna learn the guitar.

                         FLORA
               Is it easy?
                                                26.


                    JEFF
          It depends on what you want to do
          with it. Is it to play for you own
          pleasure, or someone else? Is it to
          write songs on? Or to learn your
          favorite songs? What do you hope to
          get out of this?

She thinks really hard about this.

                    FLORA
          I want to turn on my husband.

                       JEFF
          Wow.

                    FLORA
          I look at women playing the guitar,
          or the piano. And it's so sexy.
          Like, that raw talent. Being able
          to do something like t hat. Make
          music out of something. It's
          amazing. Like, Taylor Swift. Or
          Nora Jones. It's so... sexy.

                    JEFF
          Wow. Well I've never heard someone
          be that upfront about it. But I
          guess it's why a lot of people take
          up an instrument.

                    FLORA
          Is that why you took it up?

                       JEFF
          Em, no.

                    FLORA
          No, you look pretty good. I
          wouldn't say you'd need it.

                       JEFF
          Okay.

This is not going well.

                    FLORA
          So why did you start then?

                     JEFF
          Well le t's focus on you for now?

                       FLORA
          Good plan.
                                                           27.


                    JEFF
          So go ahead and sit it up there.
          Let's learn a few root chords.

They both put their guitars on their knees. His balances
there. Her's slips.

                    JEFF (CONT'D)
          Let's have a look at G.

                       FLORA
          Brilliant.

He plays it, letting the chord ring out.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          That's beautiful. So how many
          chords do you need to know before
          you can write a song?

                    JEFF
          It's not the number of chords you
          use. It's what you do with them.

He thinks o f an example. He now plays the first verse of
"You've Got A Friend". But he plays it straight up. And he
sings the first verse. But it is stripped bare. Like a bad
country singer in a bar. It sounds naive.

                    JEFF (CONT'D)
          Now. What did you think of that?

                    FLORA
          Whatever. Sounds like a boring
          country and western style song.

                    JEFF
          Right! Because I played it straight
          up, like you'd get it out of a song
          book. Same song .

He now plays the exact same verse. But this time with all the
nuanced fingering, and slight coloring that James Taylor
gives it. It's still simple, but it is like a different song.

We hold on her. He is good.

                     JEFF (CONT'D)
                (singing)
          If the Sky above you should turn
          dark and full of clouds. And that
          old north wind should begin to
          blow.
                     (MORE)
                     (MORE)
                                                        28.
                       JEFF (CONT'D)
             Keep your head together and call my
             name out loud. Soon I'll be
             knocking upon your door..."

He holds that last chord. Flora is speechless. It's a
different song. And he's a really good player and singer.

                       FLORA
             Jesus.

                        JEFF
             The first version uses the same
             paints and brushes and canvas. But
             the second one has 20 years of life
             and heartache on display. You can
             see all the brushstrokes. All the
             personality in those same three
             chords. You could know a thousand
             chords, and never write anything so
             beautiful.

                       FLORA
             Is that your problem?

                       JEFF
             I didn't know I had a problem.

                       FLORA
             You're teaching guitar online,
             love.

                       JEFF
                  (beat)
             Oh. Yes. I forgot: you're Irish.

                       FLORA
             Do you know a thousand chords?

He thinks.

                       JEFF
             We all know the same number of
             words, but we don't write a
             Shakespeare sonnet.

                       FLORA
             I get it. So what am I d oing here
             then?

                       JEFF
             That's what I'm trying to get you
             to ask yourself.
                       (MORE)
                                                           29.
                    JEFF (CONT'D)
          It's not about how much you know,
          but how much of yourself you're
          willing to put into it. Music is
          bottomless. It'll take all you got.

                    FLORA
          I'm confused.

                    JEFF
          Good.

                    FLORA
          I could know three chords or a
          thousand chords, I'd still need..
          What?

                    JEFF
          What are your goals. (Apart from
          being sexy).

                    FLORA
          Impress people.

                    JEFF
          Who?

                    FLORA
          Men.

                    JEFF
          Why?

                    FLORA
          Sex and company.

                    JEFF
          Okay. What else?

                    FLORA
          To make them like me.

                    JEF F
          Why don't they already like you?

                    FLORA
          I don't know. I think I'm amazing.

                    JEFF
          Maybe they can't see your
          brushstrokes.

This takes her off her guard, She is clearly not used to
being flattered. It throws her.
                                                    30.


                    FLORA
          Are you coming on to me?

                    JEFF
          What?

                    FLORA
          So you're a songwriter too?

                    JEFF
          How do you know?

                    FLORA
          It says it on your website.

                    JEFF
          Oh yeah. I should delete that.Let's
          talk about you.

                    FLORA
          Where do you live in LA?

He is getting a bit exasperated by her questions.

                    JEFF
          I live in Laurel Canyon.

                    FLORA
          Oh I've heard of that. I bet you
          drive a pick up? And worked with
          horses, or something.

                    JEFF
          I never worked with h orses.

                    FLORA
          What's your star sign?

                    JEFF
          I don't know.

                    FLORA
          You don't know your birthday?

                    JEFF
          Let's get back to the lesson? So,
          would you say you were a big music
          person?

                    FLORA
          I was always very attracted to
          musicians. I married one. He was on
          the same bill as Snow-patrol once.
          But I'm more into club music.
                                                 31.


Silence. Awkward. She puts the guitar away.

                     JEFF
           What are you doing?

                     FLORA
           Oh sorry, I thought that was it.

She picks it back up again.

                     JEFF
           What are you doing here, Flora? I
           mean, if music isn't really your...
           thing.

                     FLORA
           I don't know. Honestly?

                         JEFF
           Yeah?

                     FLORA
           I liked the look of you!

                         JEFF
           Okay.

                     FLORA
           And a lot of the other lads seemed
           real posers and wankers. Failed
           musicians. You seemed sorta...
           real?

                         JEFF
           I a m real.

                     FLORA
           You sort of calmed me down. When I
           looked at you the first time. Your
           voice was all soothing. Like a
           bath.

                         JEFF
           Right.

Silence.

                     FLORA
           Can I ask you something?

                         JEFF
           Sure.
                                                               32.


                         FLORA
               You might find it a little bit
               weird. Could you play that same
               song again, but this time.... With
               your shirt off?

     She blushes, not believing she said that. The wine is going
     to her head. He tries to smile. But it's thrown and offended
     him.

     He leans in, and switches the connection off. Her screen goes
     black. "You have been disconnected from the meeting"

     She sits there; a mixture of shame and g iddiness.

     Then her email beeps. She opens it up. New mail. Clicks it.

     YOU HAVE BEEN REFUNDED 20 DOLLARS.

25                                                               25
     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE - MORNING

     Another day. Flora sets off for work.

26                                                               26
     INT. A BUS - DAY

     She sits on the bus listening to the same pumping music
     again.

27                                                               27
     EXT. A BIG HOUSE - DAY

     Flora arrives at a big house. She knocks on the door. In a
     moment, the owner opens it. She is frazzled, with a screami ng
     two year old on her hip. She passes the child to Flora
     immediately without as much as an hello, and reenters.

     Flora looks at the baby. The baby looks back at her, pausing
     from crying.

                         FLORA
               Hello, little dream wrecker.

28                                                               28
     INT. A LARGE HOUSE. BATHROOM - ANOTHER DAY

     Flora is in a bathroom the size of her living room. A moment
     of peace. She sits on edge of the bath. Words an email on her
     phone.

                          FLORA
                    (wo rding/writing)
               Dear Jeff.
                          (MORE)
                                                              33.
                          FLORA (CONT'D)
                I am sorry about messing around on
                our last lesson. Suffice to say
                that wine had been taken. I do
                intend to learn the guitar and take
                it seriously. Why, I don't know. I
                was always the one in class making
                fun of the teacher. Because someone
                had to. But I won't, if you'll keep
                teaching me. Sorry I objectified
                you. I can send you a picture of my
                amazing tits to balance things out
                again, if you'd like ? Flora.


     She turns on the camera on her phone, and takes a selfie
     pretending to just about pull her top up. She makes a thumbs
     up gesture. It is very funny and wrong.

     She attaches it, and presses send.

     Then she can't believe she did but, but it's too late.
     Shrugs.

                           FLORA (CONT'D)
                Oh well.

     She stands up and we see that she's waiting for a three year
     old who is sitting on the toilet.

                           FLORA (CONT'D)
                Right. Now let's get t he shit off
                your arse.

     The three year old laughs. She kneels down and pulls some
     toilet paper.

29                                                               29
     INT. A BUS - DAY

     Flora sits on the same bus home. Headphones. Club music. Her
     phone beeps. She opens a new mail from Jeff. Excited to read.

     You are nuts. But that made me laugh...

     Next DM:

     8 O'Clock. Tuesday. No wine.

     She smiles, putting the phone away. Secretly happy.

30                                                               30
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Flo ra and Max eat at the kitchen table.
                                                        34.


Max is doing something on Garage Band on his beat-up laptop.
His headphones are plugged in. He's thumping one of the keys
over and over, which is generating a wave file on the screen.
Flora has no idea what he's doing, but the clicking is quite
annoying.

                    FLORA
          What IS that?

                    MAX
          Shh.

                    FLORA
          What are you doing though? It's
          annoying.

                    MAX
          Shhh.

He continues. She half watches, then checks her watch. After
a litt le of this, Max saves his file. Puts his laptop away.

He gets up and throws his plates in the sink.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          Right. I'm going out.

                    FLORA
               (without thinking)
          Oh good.
          I mean where?

                    MAX
          Just around.

                    FLORA
          Are you going to be hanging with
          that girl I seen you with? The one
          dressed up like a prostitute in
          your man's video?

                    MAX
          Samantha? I don't know, She might
          be there.

                    FLORA
          What's she like?

                    MAX
          I wouldn't know. Back at 9.

                    FLORA
          Or ten. If you like.
                                                             35.


     Hew pauses, surprised at his mother's leniency.

31                                                                31
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     Flora has changed into clothes that don't leave much to the
     imagination, and put on a lot of lipstick and eye shadow on.
     She pours, lights up, and waits by the computer. Checks
     watch. Then she suddenly remembers about the No Wine Rule,
     and moves the bottle and glass behind the well out of frame
     to the side of the scr een.

     She picks up her guitar and readies herself. Takes a swig.

     She clicks on her email and opens a Zoom session. Jeff is
     waiting there.

                         FLORA
               Hiya. I can't believe you got back
               to me.

                         JEFF
               You're a challenge. I like
               challenges. Shall we begin?

                         FLORA
               Let's rock!

     She picks up her guitar.

                         JEFF
               Let's find out who you are, Flora.
               What's your all time favorite song?

     She thinks hard.

                         FLORA
               I'm more into dance musi c. Oh,
               "You're Beautiful" by James Blunt.

     Jeff's face falls.

                         JEFF
               Okay, we may have a problem here.

                          FLORA
               Why?

                         JEFF
               That's not an acceptable song.

                         FLORA
               It's catchy.
                                      36.


          JEFF
So was Cholera.

          FLORA
I don't know that one.

          JEFF
If you're going to learn how to
play songs we'll have to raise the
bar a little bit.

          FLORA
So what have you written then?

          JEFF
I'm a teacher.

          FLORA
Exactly. So shut up, criticizing
Blunt. YOU do it.

           JEFF
Do what?

          FLORA
Write a song that reaches millions
of people's hearts. And makes them
weep.

          JEFF
Making people cry isn't an
achievement. Bullies do it every
d ay.

          FLORA
Let's hear one of your songs then.

          JEFF
We're here about you. Not me.

          FLORA
Jesus, it's a guitar lesson, not a
therapy session.

          JEFF
Wrong. Lyrics have to be more than
"You're beautiful". Or a series of
platitudes to lonely women telling
them how great they are. That's not
a love song. It's a self help
group.
                                                         37.


                    FLORA
          You don't know the first thing
          about women if you think that.

                    JEFF
          I know that grown up women don't
          just want to hear how stunning they
          are, like some creep in a bar
          trying to pick them up.

                    FLORA
          Jesus Christ, It's just a bloody..
          Song.

                    JEFF
          No! It's never just "a song". It's
          a three and half minute pause in
          time, in which to do something
          wonderful. Something touched by
          God.

                    FLORA
          Oh no. Are you some sort of
          Christian evangelist dude?

Suddenly, and frustrated, Jeff begins plucking a familiar
song. "I hope that I don't fall in love with you" By Tom
Waits.

He sings the first verse and chorus. He is a fantastic
singer.

                     JEFF
          "Well I hope that I don't fall in
          love with you. Cause falling in
          love just makes me blue. The music
          plays and you display your heart
          for me to see. I've had a beer and
          now I he ar you calling out to me.
          And I hope that I don't fall in
          love with you".

The chord rings out. In song terms, this is a slam dunk. No
question. Flora is blown away.

Also, we have travelled around him, and now, all screens are
gone, and they are sitting fact to face across her kitchen
table.

                    FLORA
          Jesus Christ.

                    JEFF
          Right?
                                                        38.


                    FLORA
          That's unbelievable.

                    JEFF
          So simple. So direct. Nothing about
          beauty.

                    FLORA
          You are a genius. What are you
          doing hanging around the internet
          teaching muppets like me with a
          song like that?

He starts to realize she thinks he wrote that. He lets it go
for a minute.

                    JEFF
          Do you really like it?

                    FLORA
          It's stunning.

                    JEFF
          It's never just "A song". It's
          three and half minutes in which
          time shuts down. It's al l we've
          got.

She feels his passion for this.

                    FLORA
          You've got to get that out there
          into the world.

                    JEFF
          Do you think it would sell like
          "You're Beautiful"?

                    FLORA
          Maybe not as much as that. I still
          like the other song too. Is that
          allowed?

                    JEFF
          No! That's Stockholm syndrome.
          Don't worry- we'll de-brainwash
          you. By the time you've finished
          here you just won't have time for
          childish jingles and cliches.

                    FLOR A
          I'm exhausted.
                                                           39.


                    JEFF
          We're only just beginning. Do you
          want to learn the root chords of
          that song? So you can play it?

                    FLORA
          Okay.

He picks up his guitar. They begin.

                    JEFF
          Starts in C.

He instructs her in holding down C. She is a good learner
when she applies herself. She finally gets the basic
fingering of "C"

                    FLORA
          You have lovely long fingers. Mine
          are quite stubby.

                    JEFF
          The size of your fingers don't
          matter. Django Rein dhart had two
          fingers missing.

                    FLORA
          Oh wow. Because I love him.

He starts to instruct her more. She gets it, bang on. Strums
it.

                    JEFF
          You got it!

                    FLORA
               (genuinely pleased))
          Woo hoo!

She goes to drink her wine, but then does it off screen.

                    JEFF
          What was that?

                    FLORA
          Nothing. I love this.

                    JEFF
          See, you're a quick learner.

                    FLORA
          I knew I'd be good at this! Let's
          move on, what else you got?
                                                                40.


                         JEFF
               You got G and F. But let's just
               think about C for a second.

                         FLORA
               Okay, lets.

     She lights up a cigarette.

                         JEFF
               You now are the proud owner of "C".
               You own it. And you didn't, 5
               minutes ago. You're rich. You own
               something that Elvis owned!

                         FLORA
               I'd rather have his plane.

                         JEFF
                    (ignoring the
                    interruption)
               And it didn't cost you anything.

                         FLORA
               Well, 20 dollars, for this class.
               But I do know what you mean. Go on.

                          JEFF
               You own something new, You don't
               ever have to give it back. It's not
               a must-have object. It's not a
               phone. Or a car. Or a handbag. Did
               you ever see an ad for a guitar?
               Because it sells itself. You'll die
               with that gift. You can use it
               whenever you like. And in the right
               context, it can speak directly to
               your heart in a way that we don't
               even understand. More than words,
               or ideas, or though ts. Just a
               chord, hanging in the air. C.

     She is a little transfixed. We have traveled full circle, and
     they are back on their screens.

     SLOW fade to black.

32                                                                32
     EXT. A STREET - EVENING

     On her way home, Flora passes a pub. Outside in chalk, a
     board.
                                                             41.


     "Singer-Songwriter night. Every first Monday. Sign up! Have
     fun! Cash prize".

     She pauses at the door. Looks in.

33                                                             33
     INT. THE PUB - EVENING

     A crowd of thirty or forty locals. A small, threadbare stage
     with a few instruments in an annex room of a pub. Very low
     fi. A beautiful 19 year old girl is sitting on a barstool
     with a guitar singing a really shitty self-penned song on a
     ukulele. She is terrible.

     A nother few musicians wait around to go on.

     Flora watches.

     BARRY (40), exits for a fag. He is an ex-band type guy, still
     wearing sunglasses, gel in his dyed, thinning hair.

                         BARRY
               Howareya love.

     He lights up.

                         FLORA
               Can anyone sign up?

                         BARRY
               Oh yeah. That's the idea. Keep
               music local.

                         FLORA
               What's the cash prize?

                         BARRY
               80 percent of the door. There's
               usually about 50 punters.

                         FLORA
               At how much a head?

                         BARRY
               Fiver.

                         F LORA
               Jesus. That's pricy enough. Are
               they all that shit?
                                                             42.


                         BARRY
               It's not about that. It's about
               keeping music alive in the
               neighborhood. That's what I'm all
               about.

                         FLORA
               So who decides who wins?

                         BARRY
               I do. I'm Barry Byrne. Events
               promotor.

                         FLORA
               I know who you are, Barry.

     He goes to shake hands, putting the sunglasses on his head.

                         BARRY
               Oh yeah. Jaysis. How are
               you...don't tell me.... Fiona!

                         FLORA
               Flora.

                         BARRY
               Ah! I knew you were in the F's.

     The song ends. People clap unenthusiastically. Barry claps.

                         BARRY (CONT'D)
               I'd better head in. Good to see you
               again! In the daylight!

                         FLORA
               I bet she wins.

     Flora smiles, Barry pretends to be shocked.

34                                                             34
     INT. IAN'S HOUSE - DAY

     Close on a laptop screen. A rock video for Ian's band, INDIGO
     VOID. A younger Ian is singing an okay song called "Long Way
     from Crumlin to LA". It's about a guy left behind in Dublin
     after his girlfriend goes to Ame rica. It cross cuts between
     20 year old Ian, singing in various landmarks around Dublin,
     and working on a building site, and a pretty young girl
     working and living in New York. All her shots were clearly
     shot in Dublin for NY. There's a NY cop conspicuously placed
     in every shot of her, and lots of America Flags, and various
     staples of Americana. And red and blue lights outside windows
     etc.
                                                               43.




     Ian is talking Max through it. Max is a captive audience to
     Ian's failed hopes and dreams.

     The doorbell rings, and Max jumps up, glad to be going.

                               MAX
                  See ya da.

35                                                               35
     EXT. IAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Ian opens the door to his house. Flora has the guitar in a
     case casually slung over her shoulder, like she's done this
     her whole life. Max exits, waiting on the footpath.

                            IAN
                  What's that?

                            FLORA
                  What? Oh, just... me guitar?

     He smiles.

                            FLORA (CONT'D)
                  I have a lesson later. I thought
                  I'd do it in the park.

                            IAN
                  What is this about?

                            FLORA
                  What's what about?

                            IAN
                  This whole music thing? Anytime I
                  tried to introduce you to new music
                  you tuned out.

                            FLORA
                  My tutor tells me I have "genuine
                  appreciation of melody". Now.

                            IAN
                  What do you like, then? Apart from
                  club music. Gimmie five bands.

                            FLORA
                  Well I like his songs, anyway.

                            IAN
                  Oh. He's a song writer too, is he?
                                                44.


                    FLORA
          Yeah. He is. He's brilliant
          actually.

                    IAN
          What's his name?

                    FLORA
          Jeff... The guitar guy.

                    IAN
          He sounds like some fucking clown
          who never made it, teaching lessons
          online. The ultimate graveyard for
          failed musicians.

                    FLORA
          Are you a little bit... jealous?

She smiles. This is what she basically wants.

                    IAN
          No, love. Just... concerned.

Her smiles falls.

                    FLORA
          How's Juanita?

                    IAN
          She's grand.

                    FLORA
          You do know that she's not Spanish,
          right?

                    IAN
          She's half Spanish.

                    FLORA
          Which half? Her Da is from Tallaght
          and her ma is from Blancherdstown!

                    IAN
          Her nana's people were from Spain.

                     FLORA
          My people were from Norway that
          doesn't make me a fucking viking!
          He laughs.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          Does she blow you like I did?
                                                         45.


                    IAN
          What?? Shut up.

She smiles. Widens her eyes for a moment. She moves in
towards him a little.

                    FLORA
          I'm serious. Does she?

                    IAN
          You're nuts.

                    FLORA
          She doesn't blow you, does she?

                    IAN
          Yeah, she... has.

                    FLORA
          She doesn't. I knew it. Her mouth's
          too small. Is she out? Will I come
          up for a few minutes?


Ian is dumbstruck. But suddenly, out from all the anger and
hostility, Flora is sexually charged in a way we h aven't
seen.

                    IAN
          Don't be mad.

                    FLORA
          I bet she doesn't let you come all
          down her neck, and tits, the way I
          did. Ian is gobsmacked. This is so
          wrong, and so in-broad-daylight.

                    IAN
               (smiling)
          Would you fuck off.

                    FLORA
          I'm serious. I'm over the hurt. But
          if you ever want the best blow job
          of your life, you know where I am.
          Come on Max!


Max snaps out from looking at his phone. We hold on Ian as
they walk off do wn the street. He is aroused, and you can see
it in his tracksuit.
                                                              46.

36                                                                36
     EXT. A STREET - LATER

     Flora and Max walk down a street in silence. They cross in
     the way of a CYCLIST, who steers to narrowly avoid them,
     dropping his bag and lock.

                         CYCLIST
               Wake up, will you!

                           FLORA
               Fuck off.

                         CYCLIST
               You stepped right in front of me!
               Watch where you're going.

                          FLORA
               You watch where you're going or
               I'll wrap that fucking lock around
               your neck!


     She means business. The cyclist gathers his stu ff and hurries
     off, shaking his head. Max looks up at his very angry mother.
     He notices the guitar.

                         MAX
               Are you getting rid of that?

                         FLORA
               This? No, why?

                         MAX
               Oh, what are you doing with it
               then?

                         FLORA
               It was just sitting there. Why do
               you want it now? You can have it?

                         MAX
               No. I don't. I don't like acoustic
               guitar music anyway. It's gay.

                         FLORA
               How do you mean?

                         MAX
               Just... all those feelings... about
               angels with wings, and blokes
               writing soppy love songs for girls.
                                                        47.


                    FLORA
          How is that "Gay"? I would have
          thought was straight?

                    MAX
          Whatever. It's stupid.

                    FLORA
          What are you into then?

                    MAX
          Ambient. And Electronic.

                    FLORA
          Oh. Yeah. I always loved dance
          music.

                       MAX
          Like what?

                    FLORA
          I Love Container. Sophie is
          amazing. Orbital, back in the day.

                    MAX
          Who the fuck are they?

                    FLORA
          Dance music. So who are you into
          then?

                    MAX
          Marconi Union. Do you know them?

                       FLORA
          No.

                    MAX
          They're from Manchester I think.
          Real trance music. It sounds like a
          computer made it. It's deadly.

As they arrive back at the flats, Flora checks her watch.

                    MAX (CONT'D)
          I have some Marconi Union on me
          phone if you want to hear it?
          They're brilliant.

                    FLORA
          Right, you've got your key. There's
          waffles in the fridge. I'm heading
          out.
                                                             48.


                           MAX
               Bye.

                         FLORA
               Ok. Back in an hour and a half.

     She hurries off, missing this cue to listen to music with her
     boy. Max climbs the steps to his flat, spitting over the
     balcony at pigeons below. Bored as hell.

37                                                                37
     EXT. A CRUMMY PARK - LATER

     Flora is sitting in a threadbare public park on her laptop
     with her guitar. She's sitting on her coat.

     Jeff is on the screen. They both have their guitars. They are
     both strumming E, A and D together, slowly. It's pretty basic
     stuff, like a church choir, But it's progress.

                         FLORA
               Am I ready?

                           JEFF
               For what?

                         FLORA
               To write a female empowerment
               ballad and get me husband back?

                         JEFF
               Why did he leave?

                         FLORA
                    (thinks)
               Anger?

                         JEFF
               Why is he angry?

                         FLORA
               No me. I'm angry. I almost killed a
               cyclist today with his own lock.

                         JEFF
               What are you angry about?

                         FLORA
               I don't know. I wake up angry. And
               I'm angry at my son all the time. I
               thought this guitar playing lark
               might calm me down a little.
                                                49.


                    JEFF
          Wait a second, you have a son??

                    FLORA
          I had him very young. I was 17.
          Maybe he's the reason I thought I'd
          learn the guitar.

                    JEFF
          How do you mean?

                    FLORA
          That he'd think I was cool.

                    JEFF
          Trying to look cool to your kids is
          the least cool thing you can do.
          Their "cool radar" resets every 20
          seconds. You can't keep up.

                    FLORA
          Do you have kids?

                    JEFF
          Yeah. But they're grown up now.
          They think I'm cool. Because t hey
          don't have to deal with me.I read a
          book last year about child rearing.
          Would you say you're a gardener or
          a carpenter, Flora?

                    FLORA
          Wha?

                     JEFF
          Did you plant your kid and just let
          him grow, or do you try mold him
          into a "shape" in your head, like a
          carpenter?


She thinks about this.

                    FLORA
          Carpenter or Gardener? I think I'm
          a wrecking ball.

                    JEFF
          Don't say that.

                    FLORA
          Play me your song again.
                                                        50.


                    JEFF
          Oh yeah. I meant to mention that.
          That's not my song.

                    FLORA
          What? Who's is it?

                       JEFF
          Tom Waits.

                    FLORA
          Who the fuck is he?

                    JEFF
          He's sort of an... American Tramp.
          He's also a genius. I was surprised
          you didn't know him.

                    FLORA
          Why did you tell me it was your
          song?

                    JEFF
          I didn't. You presumed it, and
          I...Sort of allowed you to.

                       FLORA
          Why?

                     JEFF
          I guess I wanted to see what it
          felt like.

                       FLORA
          To what?

                    JEFF
          To have wri tten a song like that,
          in someone's eyes. It was stupid.
          So let's get back to the lesson.

                    FLORA
          Why, what normally happens?

                    JEFF
          You wanna hear one of my songs?

                       FLORA
          Yeah.

He starts a song. Lovely chord progression. Really nice
intro. When he sings, he's got a strong, beautiful voice. The
first verse is nice. Smart lyrics. But then, the chorus
comes, and it just doesn't lift. It's... fine.
                                                        51.


But it ain't Tom Waits.

Again, as we circle him, he is now sitting across from her in
the park, in Dublin. After the chorus, he strums it out, and
stops.

She smiles. An awkward silence.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          I see what you mean.

                    JEFF
          What?

                    FLORA
          It's lovely. You're really good at
          songs.

                    JEFF
          Go on?

                    FLORA
          Just... would I want to hear it
          again?

                    JEFF
          Right.

                    FLORA
          Ever.

Jeff is crushed. But he's used to this. He puts his guitar
do wn.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                    JEFF
          No, it's great.   If folks out here
          were as honest,   I wouldn't have
          wasted a decade   and a half. Let's
          get back to the   lesson.

Checks watch.

                    FLORA
          Don't feel sorry for yourself.

                    JEFF
          I'm not. It's the most humbling
          realization ever. To start a song
          for someone. They're totally
          receptive to you. Ready. And then,
          to see their eyes glaze over.
                    (MORE)
                    (MORE)
                                                               52.
                         JEFF (CONT'D)
               And it's harder for them than you.
               The smile is still in the mouth,
               but not in the eyes. And you know.
               Flora watches him closely.

                         FLORA
               You know what?

                         JEFF
               That they've done their best to be
               changed by you. But they're still
               the same.

     He takes up his guitar, and they continue with the lesson. As
     we circle them, they are back on screens.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
               Oh, I'll send you some homework
               tonight. A link to a John Mar tyn
               song. Apropos of being angry.

                           FLORA
               Who's he?

                         JEFF
               Beautiful songwriter. Angriest man
               on the planet. A bully. Hassled his
               wife. Paranoid. Drank his head off.
               Okay. G. A/ and F sharp.

     They continue with the lesson.

38                                                                38
     INT. FLORA'S FLAT - LATER

     That evening, Flora pours wine, smokes a joint. She gets a
     ping. Jeff: Watch. This. Now.

     She opens the link to a Youtube clip on her laptop, of John
     Martyn playi ng "Couldn't Love You More".

     It's a clip from a   gig in London from 1978. John Martyn is
     sitting on a stool   with his guitar, twitchy, and buzzed on
     alcohol. His segue   patter is awkward and male and a tad
     incoherent, and he   comes off more like a pub entertainer in
     an knees-up.

     And then he starts singing.

     The music calms his whole body. It starts to pour into the
     room like a gentle wave. And into Flora's room too. The
     transformation is remarkable. It is like the music of angels.
     He sings with his entire body.
                                                               53.


     Each note more guttural, seemingly wrenched up from his body
     like diamonds from the ground.

     Flora is drawn to the table from cleaning the kitchen. She
     drops the plates, glass of water, etc, and they hang in the
     air, suspended. She pulls into the table to listen closer.

     By its end, Flora is in floods. Her tears are on the
     keyboard.

     She DM's Jeff: "Oh My GOD. What just happened?"

     In a moment he respon ds: "It's okay to be angry."

39                                                               39
     EXT. A SHOPPING CENTRE - DAY

     Flora and Cathy walk through a mall. They stop and have
     waffles with ice-cream at an indoor cafe.

                         FLORA
               He calms me down. Me anxiety just
               disappears. He's like a Xanax, in a
               denim shirt.

                         KATHY
               Can I meet him? I mean, see him.

                           FLORA
               No.

                         KATHY
               Please? I could just stand in the
               corner of the room.

                         FLORA
               That'd be very weird.

                         KATHY
               Is he good looking? Do y ou have a
               screen grab?

                         FLORA
               It's not about that.

                         KATHY
               So he's not good looking then.

                           FLORA
               He's   like a drug. He never says
               what   you expect him to say. And
               he's   sensitive. You can see in his
               eyes   he's been hurt.
                                                             54.


                         KATHY
               You're mad. Trust you to fall for
               someone who lives three thousand
               miles sway.

                         FLORA
               Six. It's the west coast.

                         KATHY
               It's a screen, you can't fall in
               love with a man on a screen, babes.
               You'll just frustrate yourself.

                         FLORA
               My ma was in love with Harrison
               Ford for 20 years.

     They continue.

40                                                                40
     EXT. ST STEPHEN'S GREEN - DAY

     Flora is walking through the park listening to Something with
     a particularly good chorus. She sits on a bench and listens
     closely. Rewinds. She is having a realization as she listens.

41                                                                41
     INT. FLORA'S TINY BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

     Over the same song, Flora is practicing guitar, and writing a
     lyric.

42                                                                42
     INT. FLORA'S FLAT. MAX'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY 50

     Flora lets herself in, surprised to hear some heavy sounds
     coming from Max's bedroom.

                         FLORA
               Fucking hell.

     She sets her keys down and enters his room . Inside, Max has
     his laptop hooked up to a set of small but powerful studio
     speakers. The music is pumping. He is sitting at a tiny desk
     covered in socks and underpants. On screen, a GarageBand
     file.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
                    (shouting)
               Jesus Christ, it's like a club in
               here! Turn it down a second!

     Max sees her, and quickly presses the spacebar, pausing the
     music.
                                                        55.


                       FLORA (CONT'D)
             Jesus, that's loud.

                       MAX
             Yeah, Keith lent them to me. Really
             powerful. I have to give them back
             tomorrow.

                       FLORA
             The neighbors will be complaining.

                       MAX
             They're junkies, they'll be asking
             to turn it up.

                       FLORA
             Who's Keith?

                       MAX
             He's a mate. A rapper. He lent them
             to me for the night.

                         FLORA
             For what?

                       MAX
             So I could mix this track.

                       FLORA
             Was that yours??

He shrugs.

                       FLORA (CONT'D)
             You're joking me?? How the fuck did
             you make that, it sounded epic.

                       MAX
             GarageBand. It's simple.

She moves over towards him and hovers over his shoulder. On
screen, six or seven tracks. Drum patters, keyboards, loops
etc.

                         FLORA
             Explain.

                       MAX
             Anyone can do it. They're all
             different tracks. You pick your
             sounds from here. He illustrates,
             highlighting various tracks.
                                                         56.


                    MAX (CONT'D)
          And you can drag in loops here.

                    FLORA
          What are loops?

                    MAX
          Drum patterns. Or you can make up
          your own patterns. But you need a
          proper sequencer for that.

                    FLORA
          And how do you control them? Like
          how did you get that mad piano
          sound?

                    MAX
          You open "Keyboard typing" and use
          the laptop keys.

                    FLORA
          No way!

He illustrates what he means. A loud, keyboard sound through
the speakers, triggered by the letters.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          Jesus, it sounds very professional.

                    MAX
          It is. It's what loads of people
          start on. Except you need a synth.
          Doing like this is shit. And takes
          forever. A note at a time.

                    FLORA
          Play it again.

                    MAX
          Nah.

She presses space over his shoulder. The track comes to life.
He turns it down a little.

They listen to a half-made piece of electronic pop. It's
catchy, but un-formed. In the right hands, it could be a
hook y piece of electro-pop. Right now, it is all over the
place.

                    FLORA
          What's it called?

                    MAX
          Don't know.
                                                              57.


                         FLORA
               Fucking hell, son. Is this what
               you've been doing on those
               headphones?

     He shrugs, a weird mixture of embarrassment and pride.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               I fucking knew it.

     She picks up her mobile and calls.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
               Come over here and hear what your
               son made.

     She hangs up and starts texting.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               I'm texting Kathy too. And the
               gals. She won't believe this.

     INT. FLORA'S FLAT - LATER

     An impromptu listening pa rty in the tiny flat. Ian is
     drinking a can. Kathy and a couple of nightclub buddies are
     drinking and smoking and listening to Max's instrumental
     dance number. Flora is passing around home made cocktails.
     Max watches from the galley kitchen. A mixture of
     embarrassment and interest.

     Later.

44                                                                44
     INT. FLORA'S HALLWAY - LATER

     The next door neighbors have called to complain about the
     music. They are a strun g-out couple. Flora is explaining.

                         NEIGHBOUR
               It's fucking very loud, Flora.
               We're trying to sleep.

                         FLORA
               Sorry, I'm playing a song for me
               mates. Something me son wrote. And
               it's become a bit of a party.

                         NEIGHBOUR 2
               I don't care. It's not acceptable.
                                                                58.


                         NEIGHBOUR
               Not acceptable.

     They all stand there.

45                                                                45
     INT. FLORA'S FLAT - LATER

     The two neighbors have drinks and joints, and are dancing.
     Ian is on a bong. The music thumps. Max smokes and takes
     surreptitious swigs from various cans and drinks. He is
     having fun.

     Flora turns it up as people dance.

                         FLORA
               My fucking son! Seriously!

     Ian picks up Max proudly, and they play fight.

46                                                                46
     EXT - SHOPPING CENTRE - DAY

     Max and Flora walk up the street. Max pauses to look at a
     Canada Goose Jacket in the window.

                         MAX
               Can I try that on?

47                                                                47
     INT. SHOP - SAME

     Max is sporting a ridiculous Canada Goose. He is swamped in
     it.

                         MAX
               Can we get it?

     She looks at the price tag. An ASSISTANT is standing by,
     smiling.

                         FLORA
               900 fucking Euro? What's it made
               of?

                         ASSISTANT
               It's full of feathers. Goose
               feathers.

                          FLORA
               From a golden goose? I wouldn't
               spe nd 900 euro on a jacket for me.
               Not to mind a 14 year old boy.
               Anyway, it's too big.
                                                             59.


                         MAX
               That's the look.

                         FLORA
               For turtles! Come on, let's go.

     He looks in the mirror, He does look a little like a turtle.
     He takes it off reluctantly. They pass a STAFF MEMBER (30),
     who is conspicuously watching them.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               What are you fucking looking at.

48                                                             48
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY

     Flora is mid lesson with Jeff. They take a break.

                         JEFF
               Well done. That's good. You're
               making progress. Your fing ering on
               the left hand is getting stronger.

                          FLORA
               Thank you. So I was thinking about
               your song.

                         JEFF
               Ok?

                         FLORA
               I think it's salvageable.

                         JEFF
               Good to know.

                         FLORA
               The problem is, that you have a
               great first verse. But the chorus
               isn't a lot better. Now, in my
               research, I find that choruses used
               to be the big deal in a song. What
               everyone's waiting for. But
               nowadays, the choruses that like,
               Ed Sheerin does do , are we allowed
               mention Ed Sheerin?

                         JEFF
               Go on.

                         FLORA
               He plays the same chords over the
               chorus, but sings a different
               melody.
                                                        60.


                     JEFF
          Right.

                    FLORA
          So it's not like... "Here comes the
          chorus everyone!!" Because unless
          you have a killer chorus, (which
          you don't), it's an anti climax.

                    JEFF
          So you're saying my verse is too
          good?

                    FLORA
          Wow. You are an optimistic guy. I
          guess that's one way of looking at
          it. Do you want to hear what I
          mean? You play the first verse, and
          sing it. Then play it again, same
          chords, and I'll hum what I mean.
          Ready?

                     JEFF
          Oh. Now?

                     FLORA
          Yeah.

                    JEFF
          What about the lesson?

                    FLORA
          I'm giving you the lesson. Go.

He reluctantly takes up his guitar. He does the first verse
of the same song we heard. Sings it. Very nice. Now he's
approaching the chorus. He plays the same chords, and Flora
hums what she means. It totally works. She has a grand voice.
They pause.

                    JEFF
          That's really smart.

                    FLORA
          And have a better lyric?

                     JEFF
               (la ughs)
          Right. On it.

                    FLORA
          No, I have a better lyric...
                                                          61.


She unfolds some paper from her pocket. She pitches him an
improvement on some of his lyrics, and he likes it. He's not
precious, and this emboldens Flora to go on.

                    JEFF
          Send me them, will you?

                    FLORA
          Sure. You can take them or leave
          them.

                    JEFF
          Let me try and fold some of them
          in. It might not work though.

                    FLORA
          Okay. Whatever. Can I get ten
          percent?

                    JEFF
          You can have 100 percent. I've
          given up trying to mak e money out
          of my music long ago. I tired that
          it almost killed the thing I love.

                    FLORA
          This is fun!

Jeff checks his watch.

                    JEFF
          See you next week.

                    FLORA
          Okay.

She smiles at him as he disappears offline. Flora closes her
laptop and takes a breath.

                    KATHY
          He's very cute!

Kathy is sitting on a stool, in the corner of the room.

                    FLORA
          Right?

                    KATHY
          Does he have a son our age?
                                                                62.

     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE - LATER

     Flora and Max enter their complex. They are both carrying a
     bunch of shopping.

     There's a gathering of kids making a video on an Iphone by
     the carpark. KEITH, is facing off the camera as he mimes to
     playback from a bluetooth speaker. He wears trainers and
     EXACTLY THE SAME Canada Goose as Max tried on, with the hood
     up.

     The same two girls wear hot pants and shake their bottoms
     into camera. It's all very generic stuff, but has a slightly
     misogynistic vibe to it. The CAMERA MAN is too old to be
     doing this. He instructs Keith how to smack their bottoms in
     the video.

     Keith now sits on the hood of a white Range Rover Sport,
     showing off watches, wads of cash and designer clobber. Flora
     sighs. Max is intrigued. They watch for a while.

                         SAMANTHA
               Hi Max!

                         MAX
               Whatever, yeah.

     He doesn't look up, embarrassed to be with his mum. They
     watch her shaking her ass.

                         FLORA
               Wow. She's really going full
               prostitute in this one. Why don't
               you just ask her out, for waffles?

                         MAX
               No way.

     Flora crosses over to her as Max legs it up the stairs.

                         FLORA
               Hiya. You're Samantha? Cheryl's
               daughter?

                         SAMANTHA
               Yeah. Hi Flora.

                         FLORA
               Jesus, you've shot up!

                         SAMANTHA
               I know. Taller than me mother now.
                                                              63.


                         FLORA
               How's your ma?

                         SAMANTHA
               She's great. Talks about you all
               the time. The crack youse had!

                         FLORA
               Aw, don't talk to me! You fancy a
               bit of dinner in ours tonight?

                         SAMANTHA
               Nah. You're alright.

                         FLORA
               Go on! Me boy is mad about you.
               Just come for a little?

                            SAMANTHA
               No thanks.

                         FLORA
               Right. Okay. See ya.

     She shrugs off.

     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Flora sits on her own at the kitchen table. Max has gone to
     bed. She has a cigarette lit. And a glass of wine. It's
     quiet. She's restless and alone. Looks at her watch.

     She thinks. Then opens the laptop. Opens her email.

     Selects Jeff Guitar guy. Sends a DM.

     "Heya. Don't suppose you're around for a lesson?"

     She sends. Waits. Nothing.

     Then she sends a text to Kathy: "Shifters"?? *

     Waits for response.

     "Already there! Ya comin?"

     She thinks about it. Checks wat ch etc. Pours another glass of
     wine. She's not bothered.

     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     Max, in his pajamas, has set up his laptop and speakers and
     leads at the kitchen table. Flora is beside him with a pen
     and pad.

                         FLORA
               Tell me what you feel about her.

                         MAX
               Can't stop thinking of her.

                         FLORA
               Good. Obsession. You're obsessed.

                            MAX
               I suppose.

                         FLORA
               I used to be obsessed. With your
               da.

                         MAX
               I don't care.

                            FLORA
               So go on.

                         MAX
               She's totally out of me league.

                         FLORA
               No she's not.

                         MAX
               She gets off with Keith.

                         FLORA
               She thinks Keith can offer her
               something. He's all glamorous and
               dangerous. With the thousand euro
               jackets. She has to know that when
               she's done with her gangster,
               you'll be there.

                          MAX
               Yeah.

                         FLORA
               You'll always be there, won't you?

                         MAX
               Yes I will. I love her.

     She is writing. Channeling his teenage obsession.

     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - LATER

     They both have headphones feeding into his laptop.

     Max has built a track, with an I-rig. It's very basic. A
     loop, and a keyboard pad and bass. The mic is live. Flora is
     reading lines from her pad. He changes and adds.

                          MAX
               T hat's you. The red.

     He presses play on the track. We hear his song idea again,
     through her headphones.

                         MAX (CONT'D)
               If we had an external microphone
               the quality would be much better.
               Do you want me to put reverb on it?

                         FLORA
               Yeah! Can you?

     He turns on "effects" and adds a little reverb, as Flora
     picks up her guitar and strums, finding the song's tempo and
     key.

     She starts to add a very simple acoustic pattern. I t's naive.
     But it's appropriate. Just a little loop.

                         MAX
               That's cool. Do that again, and
               I'll loop it.

                         FLORA
               Okay.

     He starts the track again. She does it. He copies and pastes
     it over the song.
                                                             66.


     It works, giving his digital track a human, analogue touch.
     It's not bad. It's not great either. But it's totally fun.

                         MAX
               Write these down: "And when you're
               done with your gangster. And when
               you're done with your fantasy. I'll
               be the one with the answer. I'll be
               the one, just wait and see. I'll be
               the one in your corner".

                         FLORA
               Ohh like that boxing metaphor.

                         MAX
               Yeah. What's a metaphor?

                         FLORA
               It's when y ou say something
               different from what you want to
               say. Like, did they not teach you
               this in school?

                         MAX
               No, I must have been out that day.

                         FLORA
               Anyway, that's a good one. Let's
               put that down.

54                                                             54
     INT. FLORA'S TINY KITCHEN - MUCH LATER

     Max has put down a pretty cool vocal. He's not a great
     singer. But his sharp Dublin accent suits the intense lyrics.
     They've written a kind of song. They can't believe it.

                         FL ORA
               Now send that to her.

                         MAX
               What?

                         FLORA
               That's the idea. She has to hear
               your passion. It'll knock her off
               her feet. Do you have her email?

                         MAX
               Are you serious?

     She is. He starts mixing down the track.
                                                             67.


                         FLORA
               In fact, why stop there?

55                                                             55
     INT. FLORA'S FLAT - LATER

     Flora is pitching her idea for a video as the song plays. She
     is shouting over the music.

                         FLORA
               You're standing against a white
               wall. And you're looking into the
               lens. Real intense. Like a boxer.
               In fact- maybe you're in a boxing
               ring. The camera is moving towards
               you. You're singing the words. Real
               intense.

                         MAX
               Where will we get into a boxing
               ri ng?

                          FLORA
               Your da trains in Sonic Gym. Stop
               interrupting me. I'm on a roll. And
               we intercut with a dog. He's lost.
               We follow him around town. He's
               looking for his owner. No one sees
               him. Just feet passing by. He's
               chased out of shops. It's raining
               now. His coat splashed with mud.
               You're still singing. Now the dog
               is shivering in a laneway. Now he's
               walking again. Faster. Maybe he's
               got a scent, beca use the rain has
               stopped. Someone tries to pat him.
               But he snarls. Scared. Now he's
               away from the city. Running along a
               path. Faster... and faster...
               towards the sea.... towards....

     Flora is transfixed by what she's seeing in her head. Max is
     carried by it too.

                         MAX
               Where the fuck do we get a dog?

56                                                             56
     INT. AN ANIMAL RESCUE SHELTER - DAY

     Lots of yapping dogs in cages. Flora and Max are being led by
     a VET, (23), along a corridor of cages. Different dogs' faces
     looking out.
                                                        68.


                    MAX
          Where do they all come from??

                    VET
          I know, right? The pandemic.
          Everyone bought puppies. Then after
          the lockdowns were lifted...

                    FLORA
          Just fucked them out on the
          street??

The vet nods, sadly.

                       MAX
          Humans.

Max strokes a paw of a cute dog through a cage. He is welling
up. Filled with bitter, teen rage.

                    FLORA
          Mind you- I kinda get it. You wanna
          go back to your life. And they're
          like (Dog voice):"no, you mus t take
          care of me for the rest of time".
          And you're like "no, I have a job,
          and I want to go on holidays.
          You've served your purpose". I do
          kinda get it.

                       VET
          Right.

                    MAX
          What about this guy?

Max has singled out a dog. A Staffy.

                    FLORA
          He's beautiful. What's his name?

                    VET
          He doesn't have a name. He was
          found drowning, in the canal.
          Abandoned. Plus he was born half
          blind.

                    FLORA
               (an old joke)
          Let's call him "Lucky "

Max has fallen for the dog.
                                                              69.


                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               Can we borrow him?

                         VET
               We don't really "lend" dogs out.

                         FLORA
               It's for a video.

                         VET
               No. You can't borrow him.

57                                                               57
     EXT. A STREET - DAY

     They are walking with the dog. Flora is carrying a bunch of
     dog stuff. Max is walking the enthusiastic dog. The song
     plays on.

58                                                               58
     EXT. A STREET - DAY

     A grizzled, but once handsome homeless man (40) lights up a
     cigarette. He is sitting on a box in a doorway. He hands the
     pa ck of cigarettes back to Flora, who is standing over him
     with Max in the background, pitching to him. They have the
     dog with them too.

     The man shakes Flora's hand. She gives him two plastic bags
     with food, soft drinks, a Swiss roll etc.

     Video Shoot:

     A number of exteriors. Flora and the dog and Max are filming
     all around Dublin. They are shooting shots of the dog as per
     Flora's pitch. We cross cut between them making the video and
     the actual video itself.

     Flora is a good camera operator and gets good, low angles
     with the Iphone.

     We see them blagging into shops with the dog for the shot
     etc. Recruiting strangers to try pat the dog etc. (Flora
     coaxes the dog into various action with a bag of treats.)

     Now they're in a boxing ring. She is moving in to Max, who
     lip-syncs. He is dressed in a pair of silky shorts. Skinny
     and pale. With boxing gloves on. Playback comes for a small
     bluetooth speaker. She shouts directions to him, as other
     boxers train in the background.

     Now they are running after the dog in Irishtown Nature
     Reserve. On the beach, and over the headland.
                                                                70.


     Flora is out of breath but gets some great shots. They run
     through rain. The dog is a good collaborator!

     Now they are having lunch of sandwiches and take out teas,
     huddled under a tree. They are having a laugh. The dog has
     his lunch too, a tin of Pedigree Chum.

     Now back to the video itself. The song plays as Max sings
     into camera, his head eventually filling the screen. He is
     intense and slightly scary, looking right down the lens. The
     dog runs and runs. He's running towards a tent. The tent is
     in a ditch at the end of the reserve. There are a few other
     tents around too. An improvised homeless camp.

     The homeless man appears at the zip, and the dog jumps on
     him, almost knocking him over. Michael kisses the dog, who
     licks his face and circles him like crazy, wagging his tail.
     Michael cries, reunited with his lost dog. Sometimes he looks
     into the camera lens. Which makes it more uplifting. We see
     them running the beach together etc. Eating together at the
     camp fire. The song ends with Max looking right down the
     lens.

     "I'll Be The One"

     INT. FLORA'S FLAT - EVENING

     Max is sitting in the kitchen watching MMA on his laptop and
     eating cereal. Flora hurries in with her laptop.

                         FLORA
               Can I have the room?

                           MAX
               No.

                         FLORA
               What are you doing?

                           MAX
               Homework?

     His schoolbag and copybooks are notionally on the table.

     She looks at him doubtfully. He starts typing. They smile at
     each other.

     She grabs her guitar.
                                                              71.

     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE. ROOFTOP - LATER

     Flora is climbing up the ladder and hatch out onto the
     rooftop of the flats. High above the city. A few breeze
     blocks, and an old arm chair and various discarded cans
     suggest that this is a place people sneak up to for parties.
     She is trailing up a power extension, and carrying her
     laptop, and a cushion.

     She has already brought up her guitar, cigarette s and bottle
     of wine.

     She sets her work station up, using her personal hotspot for
     a connection.

     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE. ROOFTOP - LATER

     On screen, Jeff, with his guitar. As usual, it's sunny and
     beautiful.

                         JEFF
               So I worked on your idea. Want to
               hear it?

                         FLORA
               Yeah!

     He plays the first verse and chorus of the same song. It
     works very well. She joins in (badly) for the chords of the
     second verse. Th e song has improved. They play out the second
     verse together. As the camera circles them, he is now on the
     rooftop with her again. Sitting across from her.

     They play a little more and hold the last chord of the second
     chorus.

                         JEFF
               Now it just needs a killer bridge.

                         FLORA
               What's a bridge?

                         JEFF
               A change for 8 bars after the
               second chorus.

                         FLORA
               Okay. It sounds amazing!

                         JEFF
               Better, right?
                                      72.


          FLORA
It actually works!

          JEFF
Yup. I've been struggling with that
song. Thanks for your ideas.

           FLORA
It's very intimate, isn't it?
Singing like that together. It's a
bit like... we've just made love or
something.

          JEFF
     (laughing)
No it isn't.

          FLORA
In a way though. I do feel a little
bit naked right now. I think music
is all about romance. Look at A
Star is Born.

          JEFF
Not if I don't have to.

          FLORA
Don't tell me you don't love that
movie??

          JEFF
It's a hollow lie. Anyway, music is
about something much deeper than
physical attraction. Or sex.

          FLORA
What's deeper than sex?

          JEFF
Why isn't the way things are,
enough for you?

          FLORA
They never were. I was always
pushing things. Finding ways of
getting outside myself.

            JEFF
Like how?

          FLORA
I suppose, leaving school, before
everyone else?
          (MORE)

                       FLORA (CONT'D)
             Then, getting pregnant, and not
             having an abortion when everyone
             was telling me to. I thought being
             pregnant might make me feel
             different. I thought giving birth,
             I'd be reborn. Then I was stoned
             during most of his childhood.

                       JEFF
             I was drunk when my two kids were
             born.

She studies him. He is not proud of this.

                       FLORA
             Like in a bar?

                       JEFF
             No, like in the delivery room.

                       FLORA
             Wow. That's hardcore. Bet your w ife
             loved that.

                       JEFF
             She was pushing a nine pound human
             through her vagina, and her husband
             was the one who was cracking up.

                       FLORA
             Yous are a shit sex.

                       JEFF
             You're the first person I've
             admitted that to. I drank through
             the whole first ten years of their
             lives.

                       FLORA
             What got you clean?

He thinks.

                       JEFF
             Kids made me start. AA kept me off.
             Music made it manageable.

They sit there.

                       FLORA
                  (smiling)
             The holy trinity of recovery.
                                                       74.


                    JEFF
          Hey, is that the dawn behind you??

She looks over her shoulder. The first sign of dawn.

                    FLORA
          Christ, it is. Is that the sunset
          behind you?

On his screen, it is darker than before.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          We've stayed up all night.
          So this is like... pillow talk.

                    JEFF
          You owe me for six hours.

                    FLORA
          Are you serious?

                    JEFF
          No. I enjoy talking to you, Flora.
          I don`t know why because none of
          what you say makes any sense.

                    FLOR A
          Is that all?

                    JEFF
          Nothing's enough for you.

                    FLORA
          Are you saying you don't find me a
          teeny bit attractive when I'm
          singing that song with you?

                    JEFF
          You're my student.

                    FLORA
          So?

                    JEFF
          It'd be inappropriate.

                    FLORA
          Who's going to cancel you? You're
          already no-one.

                    JEFF
          I'm not about to get into something
          with someone on the other side of
          the world through a screen.

                            JEFF (CONT'D)
                  My heart can't handle it. I'm not
                  19. Life is lonely enough as it is.

     This blows her away.

                            FLORA
                  I could get a plane?

                            JEFF
                  So could I.

                            FLORA
                  Then we'd miss each other. You're
                  not coming here. It'd be like
                  walking into a live soap opera.
                  Plus, I wanna see LA. This isn't
                  all about you. (it is)

     He smiles.

                            JEFF
                  We could play our song to a few
                  friends in the business.

                            FLORA
                  Ha. 10 percent!

                            JEFF
                  I'd pick you up at the airport.

                            FLORA
                  You'd better.

     They smile. It's nuts. Jeff is back on screen by now.

     They just look at each other. Then she presses LEAVE. And he
     is gone from the rooftop. And she is alone.

62                                                                62
     INT. FLORA'S TINY BEDROOM - DAY

     Flora is alone in the flat. She digs out her bathing suit.

63                                                                63
     INT. FLORA'S BATHROOM - LATER

     Flora has put on the bathing suit and is standing regarding
     her body in the mirror. She turns around, looking over her
     shoulder. Then from the side. She sucks in her tummy. Stands
     on her toes, etc. Then just stands there and looks at herself
     straight on. She smiles at herself.
                                                             76.

     EXT. PUB. BEER GARDEN - DAY

     Flora is sitting at a beer garden with a glass of wine. In a
     few moments, Ian saunters up.

     Businesslike.

                          IAN
                So what's so important that can't
                wait until we swap him over?

                          FLORA
                Sit down. Relax.

     He does.

                          FLORA (CONT'D)
                Do you want a glass of wine?

                           IAN
                Wine? At 10 O'Clock in the morning,
                Flora? No.
                    (beat)
                I'll have a pint.

65                                                               65
     EXT. PUB. BEER GARDEN - LATER

     We follow a pint of beer as a waitress brings it to their
     table. Flora pays for it.

     They sip their drinks. He savors the taste.

                          IAN
                Drinking during the day. This
                reminds me of old times.

                          FLORA
                Getting pissed on white wine up on
                Howth Head.

                          IAN
                Watching the sea.

                          FLORA
                Listening to sounds from your car
                stereo. Smoking spliffs.

                          IAN
                And then finding places to....
                     (winks)
                Fuck, like.

     He smiles. She smiles too, shushing him.
                                                77.


                    FLORA
          Seems like a different world.

                    IAN
          We had some good times alright. You
          and me.

                    FLORA
          We definitely did. I'll give us
          that. They sip. He looks at her.

                    IAN
          Do you want to... go up there
          today?

                       FLORA
          Where?

                    IAN
          Howth Head.

                       FLORA
          What? No!!

                    IAN
          Are you sure that's not what this
          is about?

                       FLORA
          Positive.

                     IAN
          Final answer? A tray of Dutch Gold,
          it's a sunny day. I could borrow
          Dave's Mazda. Have you back in an
          hour a nd a half.

                    FLORA
          I feel like Cinderella.

They drink.

                    IAN
          So what did you want?

                    FLORA
          How would you feel about looking
          after Max for a while. While I
          sorta, found meself?

                    IAN
          I didn't know you were lost.
                                      78.


          FLORA
Yeah, I haven't stepped outside
Dublin in 10 years.

          IAN
Where were you thinking of going?
Like, Cork, or Galway?

          FLORA
Yeah, or LA.

          IAN
Excuse me? Could you pick somewhere
further away?

          FLORA
That's sort of the idea.

          IAN
Oh, now I see. This is to see this
guitar teacher bloke? Tom Waits.

          FLORA
What? No, Maybe he'd be around, but
this is more about me. He shakes
his head.

          IAN
You have a man here !

          FLORA
What are you talking about?

          IAN
What if I left her?

          FLORA
Who? Juanita? No. She's great for
ya.

          IAN
Don't. And we can both look after
Max. Together. Like it was.

          FLORA
You blew up "like it was".

          IAN
I thought there was more, in life.

          FLORA
Well, go fuck yourself then. I
should have been enough!
                                                               79.


                         IAN
               You are. You're more than enough.
               That's part of the problem.

     She is surprised by this moment of truth. They are both
     silent for a moment.

                         IAN (CONT'D)
               I can't be looking after Max right
               now. You couldn't have picked a
               worse time.

                          FLORA
               Why?

                         IAN
               I'm thinking about forming a
               wedding band. With the lads outta
               Indigo Void.

                          FLORA
               Wow.

                         IAN
               That business is a goldmine.
               Imagine us all dressed up in Tuxes,
               with shades o n. Sort of a Rat-Pack,
               Tarantino vibe.

                         FLORA
               Have you talked to the lads about
               it?

                         IAN
               I'm still at the dreaming stage. We
               already have all the instruments.
               We could use Brian's meat van as a
               bus.

                         FLORA
               Wouldn't that be freezing?

                         IAN
               No, you turn the freezers off if
               you're not carrying meat.
               Cheers.

     He drinks. She sips her wine, her plan not working out.

66                                                               66
     EXT. A PARK - DAY

     Flora and Kathy walk around the par k.
                                                80.


                    FLORA
          The beach is down the road from his
          house. And it's constantly sunny.
          And he has a pool in his yard. That
          he put in himself. Imagine Ian
          doing that? He'd fucking drown. Do
          you know it's been 12 years since I
          had a bathing suit on!

                    KATHY
          Oh you lucky bitch. Can I come?

                     FLORA
          And if things don't work out,
          that's fine. I just come home.
          Right? But I get to say I did
          something brave. For once in my
          l ife. Something about ME.

Kathy thinks about this.

                    KATHY
               (hesitantly)
          Hasn't most of your life been a lil
          bit about you?

                    FLORA
          What are you talking about?

                    KATHY
          I mean, just... like... you have
          followed your own... thing. It's
          not like you made many sacrifices,
          like.

                    FLORA
          What, like you?

                    KATHY
          Don't get angry. I'm just saying.
          You live two minutes from where
          your mother and father lived. You
          signed on the do le for years.
          You've walked away from loads of
          jobs.

                    FLORA
          Are you for me or against me?

                    KATHY
          Look, I'm totally into you going to
          LA to fuck this guy, and maybe get
          a song heard by some friends of
          his, I'm totally into that story!
                    (MORE)
                                       81.
          KATHY (CONT'D)
But last I time I checked, miners
and frontline workers were brave.

          FLORA
Okay, well speaking of brave, would
you look after Max for a bit?

             KATHY
Excuse me?

          FLORA
You've known him his whole life. He
trusts you. Plus you have a spare
room since your brother moved out.
It's just for a month. Or so.

             KATHY
I can't!

          FLORA
I wouldn't just ask anyone.

          KATHY
Yeah you would!

          FLORA
What do you mean by that?

           KATHY
Look. I h ave a job. And I live with
me mam. I can't be taking your
nutter son in. Much and all as I
care for ya.

             FLORA
Why?

          KATHY
Do you not get how weird a question
that is?

          FLORA
Actually, no. I've never asked you
to do anything with Max. Have I?

           KATHY
No, but I was there to, if you
needed me.

          FLORA
Not good enough! You never offered.
Everyone says they care. Every
bloke I've met is all "Ah, you have
kid, deadly- let's give it a go.
          (MORE)
                                                              82.
                         FLORA (CONT'D)
                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               I'll rise to the occasion." And
               then fucking disappear. And all me
               so-called mates are like "Aw you
               and Max are so cute". But then,
               they're all going to Spain on
               holidays, and "they don't take kids
               at this resort". Or ask them to
               fucking do something for you, and
               they're nowhere to be found. They
               never babysat, never picked him up
               from school. They never thought
               about what I might want. Or what my
               needs are. Since I was 17, with a
               screaming child doing me fucking
               head in, while yous were all living
               your fucking lives!

     She is almost crying now.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               Now I want to live my life!

                         KATHY
               Well you should have thought about
               that 14 years ago.

                         FLORA
               Do you think I wanted that child?

                         KATHY
               Well we were all fucking like
               rabbits. So, I don't know. Maybe
               you did. You didn't want to get the
               boat to London. Th at's your call.
               But don't be asking people to pick
               up the pieces now.

                         FLORA
               You're my best friend. And part of
               me loves you. But I never want to
               see you again, as long as I live.
               Do you understand?

                           KATHY
               Whatever.

     Flora turns and goes. Kathy stands there.

67                                                              67
     INT. MUSIC STORE. DUBLIN CITY CENTRE - DAY

     Max is in the electronic section of Music Maker store.
                                                             83.


     It's early morning, and the store is basically empty. Strong
     sunlight. Dust in the air.

     Max is in his school uniform. His school bag slung on the
     floor beside him.

     He is knocking out a drill-style beat on a synthesizer. It's
     pretty repetitive and annoying.

     An assistant, with glasses and a beard, is losing patience as
     he tries to work.

                         ASSISTANT
               Dude. Will you turn that shit down?

                         MAX
               What do you care? There's no one
               here. And it's not shit. It's
               Drill.

                            ASSISTANT
               Oh really.

                         MAX
               Yeah. And me name's not Dude.

                         ASSISTANT
               What's your name? Though you'd
               think I'd know by now.

                            MAX
               Max.

                            ASSISTANT
               I'm Brian.

     Max just goes back to his playing. The assistant gives up.
     Goes back to his work.

68                                                                68
     INT. MUSIC STORE. DUBLIN CITY CENTRE - A BIT LATER

     The assistant approaches him again.

                         ASSISTANT
               Do us a favour? I'm dying for a
               shit, and my trainee hasn't showed
               up for work, as fucking usual. Will
               you just look after the shop for
               like, two, actually three minutes?

                         MAX
               Yeah, no problem.
                                                             84.


     He goes back to his beats.

                         ASSISTANT
               Thank you man. Just keep playing
               that shit and no one will come in
               anyway.

     The assistant hurries to a bathroom door with his own roll of
     toilet paper, and locks it, leaving Max on his own with his
     music.

     Max looks around. Is this a gift from God??

69                                                             69
     INT. MUSIC STORE. DUBLIN CITY CENTRE - MOMENTS LATER

     Max has unhooked all the wires from the keyboard. He has it
     unde r his arm. He deftly grabs a couple of cables and
     headphones as he goes, basically whatever he can grab, and
     walks to the door of the toilet. Knocks.

                          MAX
               Hello?

                          BRIAN
               Yeah?

                         MAX
               How are you going in there?

                         BRIAN
               What do you want? I'll be finished
               in a minute? Did someone come in?

                         MAX
               No. Have you wiped your arse yet?

                          BRIAN
               What?

                         MAX
               Don't call me music shit. See you,
               you fucking muppet.

     He turns and exits very q uickly.

70                                                             70
     EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Max runs down the street, looking over his shoulder. Finally,
     Brian storms out of the store, looking up and down, and then
     legging it after Max.

     Max takes off.
                                                                85.

71                                                                71
     EXT. STREETS

     A quick chase through Dublin streets. Max is no match for
     Brian, who runs fast with a long length of toilet roll
     flapping out the top of his jeans behind him.

     He finally catches Max up, grabbing him by the hair. Max
     gives up.

                         BRIAN
               You little fucking prick.

     He retrieves the synth, not letting go of his catch. They are
     both wrecked and out of breath.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
               Cops, or a slap?

72                                                                72
     INT. FLORA'S FLA T - LATER

     Flora enters the living room and flops down on the armchair.
     Pissed. She sees the guitar across from her.

     Moments later, she has the guitar case open, and she is
     putting the guitar into it. She puts various sheets in too.
     Slams it shut. She then puts the case up into the attic.

     Sits down at the kitchen table. Lights up, taking a long
     drag.

     Then her phone rings. She picks it up.

                          FLORA
               Hel lo?
                     (beat)
               Oh for fuck sake!

73                                                                73
     INT. A POLICE STATION. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Flora is sitting beside Max in a cramped interview room.
     Across from them, their JLO from earlier. Max looks a bit
     ruffed up.

                         JLO
               Max, here, stole an expensive piece
               of studio equipment from a shop on
               Wicklow street. Causing the shop
               owner to give chase, and resulting
               in severe chest pains.

                         FLORA
               Are you alright?
                                                        86.


                     JLO
           No, the shop owner.

                     FLORA
           Oh. Sorry. How is he?

                     JLO
           He's being assessed.

                        MAX
           He's fine.

                     JLO
           He could have died! You little
           prick.

                     MAX
           It's good that he's getting a check
           up then.

Silence.

                     FLORA
           How expensive was it?

                     JLO
           That's not the point. He's way past
           the number of thefts where I can
           keep him out of court. And very
           likely a correctional facility.

                     FLORA
           You're kidding me?

                      JLO
           No. I've tried everything.
           Nothin g's worked. So, for that
           reason, I'm out.

He gets up. Delivering his last line like he's on Dragon's
Den.

                     FLORA
           Guard, there has to be some way to
           fix this? You're all he's got.

                     JLO
           No. I'm done with him. He's been
           robbing since he was in short
           trousers. He's a waste of space.
           There's a time where you run out of
           road, and it's that time. I've
           tried everything. And so have you,
           Flora.
                                                              87.


     He exits.

74                                                              74
     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Flora marches Max out of the police station and up the
     street.

                           FLORA
                 A fucking 900 euro synthesizer??

                           MAX
                 I told you I needed the right gear.

                             FLORA
                 For what?

                           MAX
                 To re-record that song. It sounds
                 rubbish.

                           FLORA
                 Who are you? Fucking Drake? It's
                 just a bleedin' song on your
                 laptop. Did you not send it to her?

                           MAX
                 No. I'm not sending her shit. It
                 has to sound right. And the vi deo
                 is all wrong. Standing in me shorts
                 like a fucking weirdo. She doesn't
                 want to see that.

                           FLORA
                 What does she want to see?

                           MAX
                 You wouldn't understand.

                           FLORA
                 I'm sure she'll give you loads of
                 attention when you're behind bars!

                           MAX
                 Women love criminals!

                           FLORA
                 Oh for fuck sake! What movie are
                 you in?

                           MAX
                 Anyway, what do you care- you'll be
                 in LA with your boyfriend.
                                                               88.


                         FLORA
               He's not me boyfriend. How do you
               know about him?

                         MAX
               Do you think I'm deaf? Just go. I
               don't need you. And you don't need
               me. I'll be grand with da. Get
               outta me way, woman!

                         FLORA
               Gladly!

     He heads off. We track into her, thinking. Maybe this is her
     green light to take off. She almost smiles as she considers
     this.

75                                                               75
     EXT. IAN'S HOUSE. BACK GARDEN - DAY

     Flora and Ian sit in the back garden at Ian's ho use. It's a
     small yard. Some dumbbells. Training hoops. A pull up bar. An
     old BBQ. Some empty beer cans. Pizza boxes.

     Flora is going through files from the courts. She has a
     handle on this.

                         FLORA
               So his case comes up next Friday.
               10 O'clock. District court.

                         IAN
               I'll be there.

                         FLORA
               I'm meeting his free legal aid
               lawyer tomorrow at 12 in the
               district court offices if you wanna
               come?

                         IAN
               Okay. Little fucker . He's been
               given so many chances.

                         FLORA
               I know. Do you want to let on we're
               together, when we stand up in
               court? The judges like that. Give
               him a chance at a shorter sentence.

                         IAN
               Okay.
                                                89.


                    FLORA
          And wear a suit.

                    IAN
          I don't have a suit.

                    FLORA
          You don't have one single suit?

                    IAN
          I have five tuxedos?

                    FLORA
          Why?

                    IAN
          I bought them for the wedding band.
          It's going to be a rat-pack vibe.
          Mixed with Tarantino.

                    FLORA
          So is that up and running, like?

                    IAN
          No.

                    FLORA
          And yet you bought five suits?

                    IAN
               (deflated)
          They were on offer.

                    FLORA
          I don't think you can wear a tuxedo
          in court, you fucking spanner!

They get up.

                    IAN
          Those places have a bad rep, Flora.
          But I've actually heard they're
          more like a school now than a
          detention centre. They have
          football fields. Crafts. WiFi. It's
          very progressive. I actually think
          this might do Max a lot of good.

                    FLORA
          What. Being around hardened
          criminals for months?
                                                             90.


                         IAN
               No. Having to man up. Look out for
               himself. Make friends. Negotiate.
               People skills. He's just hanging
               around doing nothing.

                         FLORA
               That's true. I want to get him as
               little time in there as possible.

                         IAN
               This'll give us that time you
               talked about. For you dreams. And
               my projects. We've been doing
               nothing but parenting the last 14
               years. How can he respect us, if
               we're just hanging around, waiting
               on him, with no identities? He
               needs to know why we are. Maybe a
               little break will help him see us.

     She doesn't disagree.

                         FLORA
               See you in court.

     They hug. For the first time.

76                                                             76
     EXT. A STREET - DAY

     Flora and Max walk down the street towards the courthouse.
     She has put on a pants suit. Max is wearing an anorak and his
     school uniform.

77                                                             77
     INT. A COURTROOM - DAY

     Flora sits on a bench in a busy courtroom. Beside her is Max,
     and beside him GEORGE ROONEY (32), an unimpressive legal aid
     * lawyer in worn, comfortable shoes.

     A number of other OFFENDERS and their BARRISTERS are
     scattered about, and a number of POLICE OFFICERS hover around
     the exits, as barristers and officers come and go. Some
     defendants are brought in in handcuffs. Others are petty
     criminals, and are represented by assigned lawyers, same as
     Ma x. The day is just starting. Flora brushes Max's hair with
     her hand. He tries to bat it away, She perseveres, trying to
     make him look as neat as possible.

                         REGISTRAR
               All rise. Court is in session.
               Judge McGovern presiding.
                                                               91.


     JUDGE MC GOVERN(40s) enters the dock swiftly and sits down,
     taking a pile of paper work handed to her by the COURT
     SECRETARY.

     The Registrar begins calling the first case. Flora checks her
     watch, then looks at the door.

                         GEORGE
                    (whispering)
               Did you text him?

                         FLORA
               Yeah. Twice. I'll text him again.

     She fires out a text.

     Flora text again. Max looks younger than ever. The long list
     of cases starts to be hear d.

78                                                               78
     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Cases have come and gone. The room is a little emptier.

     A YOUNG WOMAN complains about all her hardship to the judge.
     Her dole was cut off. She can't pay her rent. A series of
     grievances. The Judge imposes a fine on her, and a cop has to
     lead her out, shouting and cursing, and generally complaining
     about everything in Dublin.

     Another case is called, not Max's. Flora steps out, grabbing
     her phone.

79                                                               79

     INT. IAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Ian is wearing headphones and a wool beanie. He is singing
     into a Mic in an attic room, lost in a shit song that he is
     recording. His eyes closed. His phone rings on silent on the
     desk. He sort of knows it's ringing.

     Back at the courthouse, Flora waits as it goes to message
     minder

                         IAN
                    (message minder)
               You're through to Ian. You know
               what to do.
                                                              92.


                         FLORA
               Pick up your phone, you fucking ass
               hole. This is the one thing you
               need to be at, and you're sitting
               on your arse playing video games.
               I've been texting you all morning.
               You fucking ass hole. Get over
               here!

     She hangs up.

81                                                              81

     Flora approaches the door of her courtroom and pauses,
     looking in through the glass. She looks at Max through the
     window. He doesn't s eem to get the gravity of his situation.
     He picks his nose and looks around to see if anyone noticed,
     like a little kid.

     Flora looks around at other defendant's faces dotted about
     the courtroom. The backs and sides of their heads. All
     waiting. Some vicious, angry faces. Others, scared. Others,
     blank. Then back to Max. Just another face.

     For a moment, she appears to be imperceptibly backing away
     fr om the window. Her face is inscrutable. But it looks as if
     she might turn and walk away. We PULL BACK from the window
     with her.

     Then George turns to the door as he stands up. The REGISTRAR
     is mouthing a new case. George signals for Max to stand up.
     George makes a face at Flora through the window.

     Flora snaps out of it. Enters.

82                                                              82
     INT. A COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Flora moves into the bench beside Max.

     A POLICE OFFICER (40), is taking the stand.

                         JUDGE
               Many previous offenses?

                           POLICE OFFICER
               6, Judge.

     The judge raises an eyebrow and makes note of this. She looks
     to George. George stutters into action.
                                                93.


                    GEORGE
          Max has been involved in a few
          smaller incidents. But he has
          worked with his JLO, and had been
          making progress with him over
          recent months.

                    JUDGE
          Is his JLO here today to
          corroborate that?

                     GEORGE
          No, Judge. He's on duty. But his
          reports can confirm that. I have
          them here.

                    JUDGE
          I presume you're the defendant's
          mother?

                     FLORA
          Yes Judge. His father is supposed
          to be here as well. But he couldn't
          get ou t of work.

                    JUDGE
          He lives with both of you?

                    FLORA
          Yes. We both live with him. In two
          houses. We both take care of him.

                    JUDGE
               (impatient)
          I asked where Max lived.

                     FLORA
          Yes judge. He lives with both of
          us. But at two houses. Mine and me
          husband's.

She makes notes of this.

                      JUDGE
          Carry on.

                    GEORGE
          There's been drug use with both his
          parents. His father is a musician,
          but his band split up. He's
          struggled since the n. His mother
          holds down various jobs as a
          mother's helper. Commutes an hour a
          day.
                                                        94.


                    JUDGE
          It seems to me a couple of months
          in a strict supervision environment
          might teach you to respect the
          efforts your parents have made.
          What do you think,

Max? Max shrugs. Tough man.

                    MAX
          Yeah. Brilliant.

                    JUDGE
          Teach you how things work.

                      MAX
          Cools.

She reviews her notes.

                    JUDGE
          I'll drop from 16 to an eight week
          sentence for you, Mr. Mulvey. In a
          Juvenile correctional facility.

And a year of probation. I ho pe you'll learn your lesson in
there, and that I won't be seeing you again in my courtroom.

                    MAX
          I don't care.

                      JUDGE
          Good man.

That's fairly harsh. Max shrugs. Flora can't believe it. She
sits there, mute. George whispers in her ear.

                     GEORGE
          That's not bad. Could have been a
          lot worse.

                    COURT REGISTRAR
          Does we have anything to add before
          we break? Officer?

The guard shakes his head. George also. A few people exit for
lunch.

                    FLORA
          I do. Can I ask you a question?

                      JUDGE
          Go ahead.
                                       95.


          FLORA
Are you a mother?

          JUDGE
Completely irrelevant.

          FLORA
Right.

          JUDGE
But I believe if I weren't I'd
impose a harsher sentence.

          FLORA
If the shop has the earrings back
what's the point in sending him in
there?

          JUDGE
Madam, your son was wielding a
hammer and threatening a staff
member with it.

           FLORA
He wasn't wielding it. It was in
his pocket. He'd never use it. He's
still a child. I was a child when I
had hi m. And I know the difference.
I'll do whatever it takes to figure
this out.

          JUDGE
And what would that be?

          FLORA
I have five hundred Euros put away.
I'll give it to the shop owner, and
if he's satisfied with that, he
might drop the charges. Then what's
the point in sending him in there?
And braking up me family. Without
him, I have nothing.

          JUDGE
The owner isn't present. And this
is a legal matter, not a financial
one.

          FLORA
You tell me, as a woman, as a
mother, or whatever, what you'd do
in my situation? And I will do
that.
                                                             96.


                         JUDGE
               I've raised my own children. And it
               was hard for me too. She tears up.
               Max looks down to the ground.
               George doesn't know what's going
               on.

                          FLORA
               I didn't know how hard being a
               mother was. I thought something
               would take over. In my body. Like a
               switch. And it did when I had him.
               For a few weeks, I was smitten. I
               loved you son. But day by day I
               just started returning to the same
               old me. Every minu te felt like an
               hour as a mother. The novelty of a
               new baby wore off so lightening
               quick I couldn't believe it. It was
               like a plane going down. I hated
               that I wasn't like me mother, who
               doted on us. She was so simple, So
               instinctive. I didn't know how to
               play with him. Or sooth him. And
               I'm not blaming my age, either. I
               think if I had one now I'd be the
               same. I just don't think I have it
               in me. Bu t I have this in me.

     The cop on the stand looks at the Judge makes a "Seen it all
     before" face. We hold on the judge.

83                                                             83
     EXT. A STREET - MOMENTS LATER

     Flora and Max walk down the street.

                         FLORA
               Fucking bitch.

                         MAX
               It's the system.

                         FLORA
               Fuck the system!

                         MAX
               Where was da?

                         FLORA
               He would have got you a fucking
               year.
                                                           97.


                    MAX
          I can't believe he didn't show up.
          It's like he wanted me to go down.
          I'm going to batter him when I see
          him.

                    FLORA
          After me.
               (beat)
          Don't blame him.

                    MAX
          It's not like he has a job. You
          think he'd fucking show up for his
          own son.

                    FLORA
          He's never really been here for
          you, has he?

                    MAX
          Don't know.

She stops him.

                    FLORA
          Being a father... it's just a word.
          He provides a seed. And then he
          becomes a father or not. It's
          something you do. Or don't do.
          Being a mother... is just a
          fucking... fact. I've been trying
          to get away from that all me life.
          But I just can't do it. And the
          more of a pain in my hole you are,
          the more I realize it's true. You
          little fucking prick. Oh my God.

He studies her, not quite knowing where she's going with
this, but kind of getting it.

                     MAX
          You got me sentence down to four
          weeks. I'l l be fine in there.

                    FLORA
          No you won't.

He stops her.

                    MAX
          I will now.
                                                             98.


     She pauses. She understands what he means. Suddenly, she
     grabs him, and hugs him close. He reciprocates, as best as he
     can. And we see a tear in his eye over her shoulder.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               Thanks ma.

                         FLORA
               You're okay son.

                            MAX
               Thank you.

                            FLORA
               Shhh.

     The traffic speeds by. The city goes on as normal.

     Fade to black.

84                                                             84
     EXT. THE PARK - DAY

     Flora is in the park with Jeff on screen. Music over.

                         FLORA
               When he gets out , I might come. But
               I'd have to bring him. How would
               you be about that? In real life?

                         JEFF
               I got a spare room.

                         FLORA
               Do you actually mean that?

     Jeff thinks.

                         JEFF
               How annoying is he?

                         FLORA
               Very annoying.

     They both smile.

                         JEFF
               Shit, now I won't be able to play
               you my song.

                         FLORA
               Which song?
                                                99.


                    JEFF
          The song I wrote about you.

                    FLORA
          You wrote a song about me?

                    JEFF
          Yeah. It's about your soul. And the
          time we've spent. And who you are.

                    FLORA
          What's it called?

                    JEFF
          Crazy Irish Bitch.

She laughs.

                     JEFF (CONT'D)
          I think it's rather good. And I
          haven't written a song in a long
          time. Because, since my kids grew
          up, I haven't had much to write
          about in life. So thank you.
          Seriously.

                    FLORA
          You're welcome? So I'm your m use?

                    JEFF
          Yeah. Though you should be offended
          by that these days, right?

                    FLORA
          Fuck that. Feels great. I want to
          hear it!

                    JEFF
          I'll record it and send it to you.
          I'm not playing it to you now. The
          whole idea was that I'd do it live.
          For the first time.

                    FLORA
          Okay.

They look at each other closely.

                    FLORA (CONT'D)
          Can we keep talking though?

                    JEFF
          I think we're kinda done.
                                                              100.


                         FLORA
               Don't say that.

                         JEFF
               You know the basics now. I'm not
               much better than you. Just got you
               started.

                         FLORA
               Don't. Say. That.

     She leans in, close to the screen. Her eyes are teary.

                         FLORA (CONT'D)
               Don't be a stranger.

     Then she quickly presses LEAVE, because if she didn't, she'd
     be a sobbing wreck.

85                                                               85
     EXT. COURTHOUSE. CARPARK - DAY

     Flora hangs around the carpark at the back of the courthouse.
     In a moment, the JUDGE e xits after a long day. Flora
     approaches.

                         JUDGE
               Hello?

                         FLORA
               Hi Judge. Do you have a second? I'm
               the mad one from court the other
               week.

                         JUDGE
               I know who you are. What's this
               about?

                         FLORA
               Do you have one second. I have a
               favor to ask.

                         JUDGE
               I've been very clear, and this is
               inappropriate.

                         FLORA
               You have, and I respect that. Would
               you just make one small change to
               your sentence. It's just a detail.
               But you coul d help make it happen.

                         JUDGE
               What is it?
                                                            101.


                         FLORA
               Would you let him take his music
               stuff with him? The info pack says
               there's no personal items. But he
               has headphones. And a little I-rig
               I just got him, so he can control
               his music on his laptop. And a
               microphone. I think it would be
               very good for him if he was to
               continue with his music. Especially
               with all this time on his hands.

                          JUDGE
               I don't see why I couldn't look
               into that.

                         FLORA
               For real? That would be amazing. I
               don't want to take up your time,
               but I just don't want him to get
               out of the habit of his music.

                         JUDGE
               I understand that. Let me do some
               research, and hopefully I can make
               that recommendation.

                         FLORA
               You're a star. Thank you. Sorry I
               went on in court the other day.

                         JUDGE
               The fact that you're here makes me
               think that Max is going to be okay.
               I wouldn't worry about him. As long
               as you're worrying about him.

     She shrugs, getting into her car. Flora head off, up the
     quays.

86                                                                86
     INT / EXT - MUSIC MAKER - DAY

     Flora enters the store.

87                                                                87
     INT. SAME - LATER

     Flora is paying over the money from her escape envelope of
     cash. She has bought a microphone, keyboard and some
     headphones.

     Brian, the same guy as before, is selling her equipment.
                                                            102.


     Ad-lib dialogue.

     As she hands over the cash, she starts the realize that she's
     in the place Max robbed the gear from.

                            FLORA
                  How's the ticker?

                             BRIAN
                  Wha?

                             FLORA
                  Nothing.

88                                                                88
     INT. A LARGE CAFE - DAY

     Flora is grabbing a tea at a cafe. She logs on and checks her
     mail. One from Jeff. She smiles, opening it. Downloads it.

     It's an audio file.

     She hooks up her headphones and presses play. It's called
     "Talking To You ".

     She gets through the first verse with a smile, but then it
     starts to kill her. She knows that whatever it was, it's
     over. And this is a sort of goodbye.

     She hides her tears from the few people sitting around
     chatting and reading and looking at their phones. No one
     notices her. As the middle 8th starts we shift, and see that
     Jeff is sitting right next to her. She doesn't refer to him.
     He is sing ing close to her, smiling. She balls, the tears
     pooling on her keyboard.

                            JEFF
                       (singing)
                  "So if God take me and he leaves
                  you here. I want no black
                  limousines and no sad tears. Cause
                  I'll still be hanging round the
                  atmosphere, talking to you."

     The song reaches it's end, and she is sitting alone. She gets
     her shit together, and closes the laptop. Takes her tea. And
     exits, shaken.

     ----------

     Over music, we see the following:

     Max being dropped into OBERSTOWN. It's a big compound in the
     middle of the countryside.
                                                         103.


Flora playing the guitar at home.

Max in a small, cell-like room. He is on his laptop with
headphones. His mother is sending him files. He is working on
them and sending them back.

Flora and Jeff on screen, continuing their lessons.

Flora calling around to Ian. Flora starts asking him
something.

Flora working as a waitress in a small local cafe.

Flora smoking a cigarette in her apron outside in th e sun on
her break.

Max sitting outside in the yard. He is working away on loops
on Garage-band. Other rougher kids mill around. He seems to
be keeping his head down in here.

Flora receiving an email from Max. It's a large file. She
imports it into her computer and opens it up.

She forwards this to Jeff.

Jeff opens the file on his computer and imports the files
into his PRO TOOLS sessions. A numbe r of tracks open.

Jeff puts down a guitar track and starts to write lyrics in
his notebook.

Max opens a file from Flora and Jeff. Listens. Smiles.

Max in a therapy session in the facility. A bunch of tough
kids in a circle around a THERAPIST (50). The music plays
over. This is part of this montage.

                    KID 1
          The best day of me life? The day I
          burnt down the factory.

                    THERAPIST
          You're telling me the day you did
          the very thing that got you locked
          up for, was the best day of your
          life?

                    KID 1
          Hands down. I felt like I was on
          fire meself. I felt alive that day.

                    THERAPIST
          Okay. Next?
                                                            104.


                         KID 2
               The best day of me life is the day
               I get out of this kip.

                         THERAPIST
               That's a day in the future. I'm
               talking about up to know.

                         KID 2
               I haven't had a good day.

     The Therapist is moved. He nods to Max to go.

                         MAX
               Best day, was... the day I made a
               video with me ma.

                         THERAPIST
               You made a video with your mother?
               Can we see it?

                            MAX
               No.

                         THERAPIST
               But that's your day?

                         MAX
               That was a good day.

     The therapist nods and they continue.

     EXT. OBERSTOWN - DAY

     Flora is waiting outside with a few other mothers (and a
     couple of fathers), as a few KIDS are released. The DOG is
     with her.

     Max appears, carrying his bags. She hugs him. He allows
     himself to be hugged, but doesn't really reciprocate. But we
     can see on his face that he's happy and relieved to see her.
     He gets down and lets the dog lick his face.

     They w alk off together towards a bus stop.

     INT. A BUS - DAY

     Max and Flora chat as music plays over. He laughs.
                                                            105.

     EXT. FLORA'S HOUSING ESTATE - LATER

     Flora walks across the carpark of the flats. Max is sitting
     on a wall chatting with Samantha, the girl from the video. A
     few shady looking teens hang around, including Keith, the
     "singer" from the video. Keith distributes nags of coke, and
     addresses with a few YOUNG KIDS on electric scooters. They
     speed off to do deliver. Others return with cash, and hand it
     ov er to Keith.

     Flora takes all this in. Though she's seen everything in this
     neighborhood.

     EXT. THE PUB - NIGHT

     A few smokers have gathered at the back door to the pub. Bad
     singer-songwriter music emanates from inside. Ian has double-
     parked his small hatchback, and he and Flora and Max are
     unloading their gear. Flora has her guitar case, Max his
     various keyboards, laptop, cables etc.

                         IAN
               I'll park this properly and see you
               inside. Good luck.

     He goes to get in.

                         FLORA
               Get up with us?

                         IAN
               Nah. I'll be at the bar. I'll see
               yous after.

                         MAX
               Come on. It'll be a bit of crack.

                         FLORA
                    (smiling)
               Come on!

                         IAN
               No thanks. I'm a professional bass
               player. I'm not playing at some
               random amateur night.

                         MAX
               I want you to get up with me. You
               weren't there in court. I want you
               to do this with us.

     He sees that Max means business. He's standing up to his da.
     He knows he owes this to them.
                                                             106.


                         IAN
               I don't have me bass anyway.

                         MAX
               I packed it.

                            IAN
               Wha?

                         MAX
               It's in the boot.

     Silence. He can't get out of this one.

                            IAN
               Fuck sake.

93                                                                93
     INT. THE PUB - LATER

     We're in the small room for the singer songwriter night. A
     good crowd has assembled.

     A gorgeous GIRL (23) is finishing her song. It's not good.
     But BARRY. The organizer, claps conspicuously loudly.

                         BARRY
               Give it up for "Heart"

     The audience claps. Barry smil es at "Heart" and gives her a
     thumbs up. She's going to win.

                         BARRY (CONT'D)
               She's amazing. Long career ahead of
               her. Next up, is Flora, (reading)
               and her son.

     Flora and her gang take to stage, plugging in cables, and
     pulling up chairs. Barry helps.

     Ian is on bass. Max sets up his laptop, with his I-Rig and
     another small synth.

     Flora unzips her acoustic and opens her laptop. She sits this
     laptop on a high st ool and goes online, opening up Zoom. She
     and Barry plug the laptop into the desk, as a SOUND MAN works
     the desk. It takes comically long, as the audience gets pints
     in.

     On screen, is Jeff. He has an electric guitar. Behind him is
     a drummer. They do a rough levels check, and Flora talks into
     the mic. Flora & Son - Blue Revisions 01/08/22 99.
                                                       107.


                      FLORA
            Sorry about that. This is Jeff.
            He's in LA. Say hello,

The crowd like this. They wave, trying to figure this out.

                      JEFF
            Hello Dublin!

                       CROWD
            Hello!

                      JEFF
            I've always wanted to say that.

Gets a laugh. Flora spreads her lyrics page on a stool in
front of her.

                      FLORA
            This is Ian, on bass. And Max, my
            son, on keyboards. He wrote this
            while he was in jail.

                      MAX
                 (off mic)
            Shut up ma.

                      FLORA
            Okay. We wrote this song to gether.
            Jeff helped. And Ian. In a way.
            It's early days, but we thought
            we'd try it live. Is that okay?

The audience cheers.

                      FLORA (CONT'D)
            I've never done this before. I've
            had diarrhea all week leading up to
            this. But here goes. Ready lads?

                      JEFF
            Don't be nervous.

                      FLORA
            Easy for you to say. You're six
            thousand miles away. This is a
            Dublin audience. They'll savage me
            if I fuck it up!

Laughter.

Ian starts a count in.
                                                        108.


Flora starts playing the acoustic. It's simple. A few chords.
She sings. It's nice. Her voice is brittle, but builds a
little in confidence as the song picks up.

The band joins in. The sound mixer works the levels. It
starts to sound OK. And the song is straight from the heart.
A ballad, that picks up in tempo and becomes a lively feel-
good number.

The lyrics take their cue from the Icarus and Dae dalus story.
And is about how she had Max when she was still a child
herself. And was flying too close to the sun, with drugs and
drink. Now, she is realizing that her sun is, in fact, her
son.

Max is comically frozen on stage, but plays his parts well.
Jeff is a natural. Ian takes his place in the background.

In the audience, the small Dublin crowd are well into it.
They are won over by the effor t and the fun of it all. Kids
drink soft drinks. Babies are lifted up. Dave is flirting
outrageously with HEART, and telling her how great she is.
Kathy is in the front row. The barman pulls a pint, then just
drinks it himself.

The song swells towards it's climax. Flora smiles over at her
son. He manages a quick smile back. Then she smiles at Jeff.

The song soars and ends as we hold on Flora's fac e. The
audience clap, delighted. Flora and the others are surprised
at how much fun that was.

We don't know if they win or not.

And it doesn't really matter.
