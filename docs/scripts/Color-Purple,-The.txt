WE HEAR A BLUEGRASS BANJO PLAY as...

TITLE CARD: SPRING OF 1909. THE GEORGIA COAST.


EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

MISTER (a handsome indigo farmer) rides his horse. A Stetson
hat is cocked low, COVERING HIS FACE. The trot of his horse
against the dirt inspires a melody and he plucks the banjo in
his lap to the beat. This will set the tone for an
exhilarating percussive score that will loom large in the
film.

H e passes a GOLDEN WEEPING WILLOW TREE. Inside, the voices of
TWO GIRLS sing 01."HUCKLEBERRY PIE/OPENING" to his melody...

                    CELIE
          Hey, sista, whatcha gon' do?

                    NETTIE
          Goin' down by the river, gonna play
          with you!


EXT. THE GREAT ANGEL OAK - DAY

CAMERA MOVES through the tree's draping bush revealing CELIE,
14, pregnant, with a smile that could melt butter, and her
sister NETTIE, 12, breathtakingly beautiful and studious.

Wearing white dresses, the girls sit on a branch covered in
moss. THEY PLAY A POLYRHYTHM IC VERSION OF PATTY CAKE with
hand slaps, snaps, and hand shakes, which harmonizes with the
man's banjo and the march of his horse. Above, the first
light of morning paints the world sunrise blue.

                    CELIE
          Papa don't like no screamin' 'round
          here.

                    NETTIE
          No lip from the woman when they
          chug that beer.

The girls run from the tree's bush. One monarch butterfly
lands on Celie's arm. Its wings bare patterns that resemble
West African Kente cloth. It's the first sign that this world
is drenched in magical realism.

                    CELIE & NETTIE
          Sho nuff sun gon' shine. Gonna be
          grown ladies of the marryin' kind.
                                                          2.


EXT. DEADWOOD BEACH - DAY

They watch a butter-orange sun climb up from the ocean. The
sun wears a crown of light. IT LOOKS REAL YET MAGICAL. The
girls open their arms to its warmth.

                    CELIE & NETTIE
          Sho nuff moon gon' rise like a
          huckleberry pie in the middle of
          the sky. Gon' be alright. Gon' be
          alright.

PRE-LAP: A ROOSTER CROWS!

The sun spreads its light over the vast Georgia Coast.

                                              MATCH CUT TO:


EXT. BA CK ROAD (MAIN DRAG, BLACK PART OF TOWN) - DAY

A YELLOW CHURCH HAT RESEMBLING THE SUN is placed on the head
of FIRST LADY. She is a statuesque beauty who's convinced God
made her tall so she could look down on folks. She walks
outside singing 02."MYSTERIOUS WAYS."

                    FIRST LADY
          It's Sunday morning!

Her female neighbors (CHURCH MOTHER, MISSIONARY, USHERETTE,
PIANIST, DEACONESS, and PROPHETESS) exit their homes wearing
equally huge hats of varying colors. When they stand one
behind the other, they form a rainbow. They respond:

                    FIRST LADY & CHURCH LADIES
          So make a joyful noise! Unto the
          Lord!

BLACK FOLK RUSH OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND GATHER IN THE ROAD.
They greet each other. FIRST LADY LEADS THEM TO CHURCH. Two
dozen people (men, women, and children) march in stylized
fashion, swinging their arms and high-stepping to the beat.
This happens every Sunday.

First Lady lifts her bible and sings as more people in town
leave their homes to join the procession.

                    FIRST LADY
          When the King threw Daniel in the
          lion's den.

                    ENSEMBLE
          The Good Lord works in mysterious
          ways.
                                                           3.


The people signify. When they touch each other, they get the
spirit momentarily then continue to march and sing to the
music.

                       FIRST LADY
            God sent a mighty angel brought him
            out again.

                      ENSEMBLE
            The Good Lord works in mysterious
            ways.

They continue to high-step down the road in stylized fashion.

                      FIRST LADY
            When God saw the wicked he knew
            what to do.


          FIRST LADY (CONT'D)                 ENSEMBLE
Said, Noah, bring the animals     Oh
two by two. 'Cause I'm gonna      Oh
keep your boat afloat for
forty days.


When First Lady stretches out her hands, the entire ensemble
leaps and spins. They are magnificent! Their high-stepping
gets even higher as knees and feet are kicking up dust!


            FIRST LADY (CONT'D)             ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
Yeah Yeah                         The Good Lord works in
                                  mysterious ways.


EXT. FURTHER DOWN MAIN DRAG, BLACK PART OF TOWN - DAY


          FIRST LADY                      ENSEMBLE 1 & 2
Yes, He works                     Yes, He works. (Oh He works!)
Oh, He works                      I know He works!

                      FIRST LADY (CONT'D)
            The Good Lord works in mysterious
            ways.


EXT. END OF MAIN DRAG, BLACK PART OF TOWN - DAY

They all move away from the road, which was shaded by trees,
and into the open fields. We see a cascade of arms as they
try to shield themselves from the bright sunlight.
                                                            4.


         ENSEMBLE 1                        ENSEMBLE 2
Yes, He works                    I know He works
Oh, He works

                    FIRST LADY
          Oh, the Good Lord works...

First Lady is not bothered by the sun. She keeps singing.

                    FIRST LADY (CONT'D)
          Don't waste your time tryin' to
          rassle with your worldly woe.

Some of the ensemble open umbrellas one after the other
creating what looks like flower buds FROM ABOVE. Beneath the
umbrellas, First Lady and others walk through them as
s unlight shines on the umbrellas, creating a prism of color
inside.

                    ENSEMBLE
          The Good Lord works in mysterious
          ways.

First Lady nods to someone thanking them for the shield as
they move out of the rays of the harsh light.

                    FIRST LADY
          'Cause God's watchin' over you
          wherever you go, yeah!

                    ENSEMBLE
          Yes, The Good Lord works in
          mysterious ways.

The ensemble continues to move through town with umbrellas
and b ibles! They pass the fields.


                                            ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
         FIRST LADY
If your poor back breakin'       Ooooh
under all that weight. St.       Ooooh
Peter's gonna lift it at the     Ooooh
pearly gate. Let The Spirit      Ooooh
walk beside you on your          Ooooh
darkest days.                    Ooooh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah                 The Good Lord works in
                                 mysterious ways.


EXT. ROAD TO MAIN STREET - DAY

They high-step down the hill. Umbrellas are now used as
canes. A Choir and a Horse Drawn Piano join the parade!
                                                          5.


Young women march toward the camera, smacking their shoulders
and clapping their hands.

          FIRST LADY                 ENSEMBLE 1/ ENSEMBLE 2
Oh yes, He works.                Yes, He works / I know..
The Good Lord works              Oh, He works / He works
In mysterious ways               Yes, He works / I know He
                                 works
                                 Oh, He works

First Lady is so overcome, she starts to faint but some of
the men catch her just in time and lift her onto their
shoulders. She looks u p to God as if it were a miracle.

                    FIRST LADY (CONT'D)
          Ohhh, The Good Lord works in
          mysterious ways...

Music becomes mellow and ecstatic. Ensemble: oohs and ahhs.


EXT. THE GENERAL STORE - DAY

ALFONSO (the sisters' only guardian whose cold disposition
has been iced by years of oppression and bitterness) leads
Celie and Nettie out of the store of which he is the
proprietor.

                    ALFONSO
          Let's get a move on, Celie, you 're
          slower than mud.

                    NETTIE
          She's going as fast as she can, Pa.
          She say the baby been kickin'.

All three join the procession.

                    DEACONESS
          Whatchu gon' call your baby, chile?

                    CELIE
          If it's a boy, I'm a name him Adam.
          `Cause in The Bible Adam had a
          garden. And I wants mine to own
          land.

                    DEACONESS
          Ain't that precious.

                    ALFONSO
          Celie! Nettie! Get up here!
                                                         6.


                       CELIE/NETTIE
          Yes'em Pa.


EXT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

First Lady waves her own fan as rows of women behind her
swing their arms in stylized fashion as they fan themselves.
The action creates a domino effect. It looks like a waterfall
of arms. Light hits the fans, creating shadows.


     ENSEMBLE 1, 2 AND 3                    FIRST LADY
God still works                   Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
He still works                    OHHH
God (God) God still works


                    FIRST LADY & ENSEMB LE
          In mysterious ways (yay!) yaayyyy!


EXT. THE CHURCH - DAY

We see REVEREND AVERY at the entrance to the church. He
carries his bible and preaches as the ensemble stomps, claps,
and dances towards the church!

                    REVEREND AVERY
          None of us knows what The Lord's
          got planned for us, no sir. So I
          want you to stop your moanin', and
          quit your groanin'. Throw away your
          handkerchief! And put your hand in
          His and follow where He leads.

They all high-step, passing The Reverend, full of the holy
spirit. Now they are high-skipping across the grass toward
the church - arm in arm. Others with their arms waving in the
air. Some dance around Celie and Nettie.

                    REVEREND AVERY (CONT'D)
          The Good Lord's walkin' witcha.

                    ENSEMBLE
          Walkin' witcha.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          The Good Lord's talkin' witcha.

          Talkin' witcha.
                                                            7.


                    ENSEMBLE 1, 2 AND 3
          God (God) God is singin' witcha.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          And He is shoutin' witcha.

                    ENSEMBLE
          Shoutin' witcha.

Over ensemble and vocal interlude:


INT. THE CHURCH - DAY

Inside, the congregation praises God as folks dance even more
passionately. They slide down pews, stomp, clap, and shout in
an exquisite chaos. Reverend Avery sits on a throne-like
chair in the pulpit. Celie and Nettie sit in the back pew
singing along. Alfonso sits next to them, bored.


        REVEREND AVERY                     ENSEMBLE
Oh! Oh, yeah!                   Because the Good Lord works
                                in mysterious...

                    CELIE
              (praying)
          Dear, God...

Reverend Avery slams his fist on the podium breaking into her
day dream.


        REVEREND AVERY                       ENSEMBLE
In mysterious ways              Ways!
Yes! Oh, yeah.


In unison, the entire church falls to their knees. Song ends.

                    REVEREND AVERY (CONT'D)
          Let us pray.

They bow their hea ds.

IN CELIE'S IMAGINATION: The statue of Jesus on the cross,
hanging on the rear wall below stained glass.


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - CELIE & NETTIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Celie bows her head as her sister braids her hair. Celie sits
on a pillow. Nettie stands, reciting a folktale passed down
from their mother.
                                                            8.


The girls live with Alfonso in a two-bedroom apartment above
the store. They share a small room that they have clearly
made their own. Note: there is no sign of the color purple.
Nettie recites a version of the African American folktale -
"All God's Chillen Had Wings."

                    NETTIE
          "...the girl returned to work in
          the field. But it was so hot she
          could barely stand. The overseer
          yelled at her till she got to her
          feet. Frightened, the girl turned
          to her mama and asked..."

                    CELIE
          Let me say it. This my favorite
          part. The girl said... "Now Ma, can
          I do it now?"

Nettie smirks. Celie looks at the hem of her dress. She
traces her fingers across the stitching and remembers. She
looks in the mirror...


INT. CELIE & NETTIE'S ROOM - DAY - 1905 (FLASHBACK)

Instead of Nettie being there braiding her hair, Celie sees
her mother. MAMA (Celie and Nettie's mother, stunning and
warm). She holds a spool of thread. CAMERA PULLS into the
mirror.

                    MAMA
          Yes, Miss Celie. Fetch some fabric
          then I'll show you how to sew.

Excited, Celie runs to the corner and fetches blue fabric
from a basket.

MINUTES LATER:

She sits in her mother's lap as she watches in awe as her
mother sews a hem into the very skirt that Celie was wearing
i n the present-day. Her mother opens her hand.

                    MAMA (CONT'D)
          Give me ya hand. Mama want you to
          get a feel for the needle and the
          cloth first.

                    CELIE
          Yes, ma'am.

Mama takes her hand and helps her weave needle and thread
through the fabric. The action makes Celie smile.
                                                         9.


                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          When can I wear it?

                    MAMA
          Not now baby but soon. This here
          color's gon' be heaven on you.

Eventually Mama lets Celie's hand go so the young girl can
sew by herself. She does so like an expert.

                    NETTIE (V.O.)
          "The girl was floating above the
          ground but she wasn't flying yet.
          She got nervous that the overseer
          would catch her, and without faith,
          she fell to the dirt hard..."

Celie pricks herself wit h the needle. She shrieks! But
instead of blood spurting from her finger, she sees a pool of
water seeping between her feet. She shrieks again!

RETURN TO THE PRESENT:


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - CELIE & NETTIE'S ROOM - DAY

CAMERA PULLS BACK out of the mirror as Celie looks at Nettie.

                    CELIE
          I broke my water!

Nettie looks down and sees the puddle!

                    NETTIE
          Hold still! I'll get the midwife.

Nettie leaves. Celie feels a PANG and grabs her belly.


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - CELIE & NETTIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

CELIE IS BREATHING HARD. She's been in labor for hours. She
lies in bed by candlelight. Sweat is coming down her face.
Nettie holds her hand. THE MIDWIFE (a deeply spiritual woman,
solid and wise) is looking between Celie's legs.

                    MIDWIFE
          One more good push, Miss Celie. You
          almost there.

Celie PUSHES with a SCREAM ! The baby cries.

                    MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
          It's a boy.
                                                        10.


The midwife puts the newborn, wrapped in a blanket, into
Celie's arms. Nettie is wiping Celie's brow with a wet rag.
The girls smile at each other.

                     CELIE & NETTIE
          Adam.

HOURS LATER:

Celie breastfeeds, basking in moonlight. Alfonso opens the
door, dressed in coat and hat.

                    ALFONSO
          That baby nursed yet?

Celie ignores his question.

                    CELIE
          I had a boy, Pa. His name Adam.

                     ALFONSO
          Hand 'im here. I'll give him to
          G od. Same as I did the other one.

                    CELIE
          Let me have just one more day with
          `im. Just to make sure he okay.

                    ALFONSO
          Naw. Ain't no sense in you gettin'
          attached. Maybe if ya mama was
          alive she could look after it. You
          too young to mother-

                    NETTIE
          I can help Celie with the baby.
          I'll even pull some of her weight
          `round the house.

                    ALFONSO
          Naw, you got schoolin'. Give `im
          here.

He takes the child who instantly CR IES. He leaves.

                    CELIE
          You think he killin' my babies?

                    NETTIE
          I believe he give `em to God, like
          he say.
                                                         11.


                    CELIE
          But they mine. How come God don't
          give `em back?

Nettie kisses Celie's forehead then makes her bed. Celie
rushes to the window to see her father board his horse and
buggy carrying the baby.


EXT. GENERAL STORE - NIGHT

Alfonso rides off in a horse Buggy with the baby,
disappearing into the night.

TITLE CARD: SUMMER OF 1910. A YEAR LATER.


EXT. DEADWOOD BEACH - DAY

Nettie walks along the shore carryin g her books and shoes.
She lets the low tide sweep across her bare feet.

Mister, the man from earlier, saunters by with his banjo.
This time he's sitting up on his horse.

                      MISTER
          Aft'noon.

                    NETTIE
          More like early evenin' but howdy.

                    MISTER
          Early evenin'? That mean it's late,
          gal. Let me give you a ride home.

                    NETTIE
          I ain't nobody's gal but my ma and
          she dead. You can call me Nettie.

She walks on. He tries another strategy. He unstraps his
banjo from the side of his saddle and plays. He follows her.

He sings a few lines of 03."MISTER." His voice is soothing.

                    MISTER
              (making up the song)
          You got some pretty teeth, Nettie.

                    NETTIE
              (to herself)
          Oh Lawd, he singin'.

She continues to walk. He follows on his horse.
                                                         12.


                    MISTER
          And your skin dazzle my eyes. Like
          the moon light the night.

                    NETTIE
              (laughing)
          And he poetical too.

He does a trick with his hat.

                    MISTER
          That's a real pretty dress, Nettie.

                    NETTIE
          My sister made it.

She puts on her shoes.

                    MISTER
          And them shoes look just right on
          them pretty little feets.

                     NETTIE
          Now you lyin'. I got corns,
          bunions, and blisters. I'm a tomboy
          and I likes to climb trees - ain't
          nothi n' pretty `bout my feets. Now
          leave me be!

                    MISTER
          Name's Mister.

She can tell he's bad news. She simply walks away. He looks
at her even more enchanted. He clearly thinks she's playing
hard to get. She's not.


EXT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

Nettie walks into the general store. We follow her.


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - DAY

Nettie passes Celie who is on a ladder stocking shelves. She
turns around and sees CORRINE , 23, the Pastor's wife. She is
pushing a two-year-old baby in a stroller. She walks down an
aisle.

Celie looks down at the baby as Corrine passes. When Corrine
turns her back to examine items on a shelf, Celie takes a
peek at the baby's blanket. SHE FINDS THE NAME "OLIVIA" sewn
on it. It's her first born!
                                                          13.


                    CELIE
              (whispering to the baby)
          You know who I is? I'se ya maw.

The baby drops a TOY RATTLE. Celie picks it up. Alfonso
catches her.

                    ALFONSO
          Celie! Get your narrow behind back
          to work!

Celie grabs a broom and hurries out of the store MAKING QUICK
EYE CONTACT WITH CORRINE who tries to greet her.

                    CORRINE
          Blessings, honey...

Celie RUNS AROUND--


EXT. SIDE OF THE GENERAL STORE - CONTINUOUS

She leans against the w all, grinning. The sight of seeing her
baby after years of longing thrills her to no end. She looks
back inside of the store window and CORRINE notices her.
CELIE pretends to sweep the sidewalk. She hears the hammering
of a chain gang and IMAGINES:

CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL A HAND SWINGING A PICKAXE.


EXT. QUARRY - DAY

The pickaxe sets the beat of a CHAIN GANG breaking rocks.
They're making a road f or train tracks. We hear them chant
"hwuh" repeatedly. This music inspires a song from Celie. She
sings 04."SHE BE MINE."

                    CELIE
          I seen my baby girl. Can't be no
          one else. Lookin' just like me and
          my daddy. More us than us ourself.

Celie walks past the prisoners on a chain gang still hitting
rock with their pickaxes.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I sees her hand on the lady's
          shoulder. She come outta me chewing
          her fist. She got my eyes. And a
          face I done kissed. I sews "Olivia"
          on her diades. Lil stars and
          flowers too. I know she sees sa me
          things I do.
                                                         14.


IN CELIE'S IMAGINATION: The CHAIN GANG are singing her song.

                    CELIE & THE CHAIN GANG
          Oh The Lord done send me a sign.
          Oh, I know... she be mine.

PASTOR SAMUEL rides past CELIE in the horse carriage, with
Corrine holding the baby in the back. CELIE runs to catch up.
She hears children laughing in a nearby creek.


EXT. THE CREEK - DAY

BLACK WASHERWOMEN wash their clothes in the water and hang
them on nearby tree branches.

                    CEL IE
          When I see mamas holdin' babies. I
          feel pain come `cross my heart.
          Something deep inside been torn
          apart. It like a spell come on my
          body. My baby's breath on me. She
          gon' carry her away but I still
          see...

The washerwomen hang laundry and rock their babies.

                    CELIE & WASHERWOMEN
          Oh The Lord done send me a sign.
          Oh, I know... she be mine. Oh The
          Lord done send me a sign. Oh, I
          know... she be mine.

T he washerwomen dance.

                    CELIE
          She be mine. She be mine. She be
          mine. She be mine. She be mine. She
          be mine. She be mine. She be mine.
          She be mine.

CELIE spots the CHAIN GANG marching atop the creek. CAMERA
TRACKS along with them.

                       ALFONSO (O.C.)
          Celie!


EXT. THE GENERAL STORE - DAY

ALFONSO'S VOICE SNAPS CELIE OUT OF HER FANTASY. CELIE runs
around to the front and realizes CORRINE and her baby are
gone. S he imagined the moment as she hasn't left the store.
                                                         15.


                    ALFONSO
          Where was you?

                    CELIE
          Sweeping the porch.

She is clever. Alfonso is skeptical but lets her pass.

                    ALFONSO
          Get upstairs.

Celie runs up the stairs, smiling. We realize that she kept
her baby's TOY RATTLE.


EXT. THE GENERAL STORE - LATER

Alfonso sits on his porch whittling a spoon. Mister is
waiting on him, sitting on his horse.

                    ALFONSO
          What can I do ya for?

                    MISTER
          Thinkin' `bout plantin' seed. Maybe
          grow tobacca. Folks say you used to
          grow some yaself.

                    ALFONSO
          Tobacca a hard crop. You best stick
          to indigo. Leave real crop to real
          men.

Mister responds by spitting on Alfonso's land. Alfonso looks
at the spit, annoyed.

                    MISTER
          I wants to ask for your Nettie's
          hand. I needs me a wife.

                    ALFONSO
          Who in they right mind gon' marry
          you with all them triflin', no-good
          chill'en you got?

                    MISTER
          They triflin' `cause they ain't got
          no mama. I needs a woman to make
          `em mind.

                    ALFONSO
          You gon' need more than that from
          what I hear. `Sides Nettie too
          smar t.
                    (MORE)
                                                        16.
                    ALFONSO (CONT'D)
          She gon' be a school teacher. I'll
          let you have Celie, though, for a
          cow and a couple of eggs. She ugly
          as homemade sin but she works like
          a man.

                    MISTER
          Celie? That's what you call that
          thang that just walked in yo'
          store? I don't want that.

                    ALFONSO
          Then ya chill'ren ain't beat you
          bad `nough yet. You'll come `round.
          Hopefully, `fore they burn down ya
          house.

Off Mister, gritting his teeth. CAMERA BOOMS UP SEEING CELIE
AND NETTIE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.


INT. GENERAL STORE - CELIE & NETTIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

                    CELIE
          Who dat outside talkin' to Pa?

                    NETTIE
          The devil. He followed me home from
          school. Now I can't get rid of him.

                    CELIE
          He sho' look nice for a devil.

                    NETTIE
          Devil always look nice till he
          raisin' hell. Church ladies say he
          got four triflin' chill'ren at
          home.

                     CELIE
          Four? That's a handful and a
          headac he.

                    NETTIE
          Say his last wife got shot by some
          man she was seeing on the side. But
          he didn't grieve none cause he got
          somethin' on the side too. A loose
          woman named Shug Avery.

                    CELIE
          What's a loose woman?
                                                          17.


                    NETTIE
          A woman who won't let no man tie
          her down, I s'pose.

                    CELIE
          That sounds nice. I wants to be a
          loose woman.

Celie dances seductively. Nettie stops her.

                    NETTIE
          No, you don't. We come from queens.
          Let me teach you somethin'.

Nettie DRAWS A MAP OF AFRICA ON THE WALL.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          Today, Mrs. Beasely told us about
          Africa. She say that's where our
          peoples is from.

Celie traces the sketch of the continent with her finger.

                    CELIE
              (sounding the word out)
          Af...free....kah.

                    NETTIE
          She say our mommas was queens over
          there. That means we royal-tee.

Nettie wraps Celie's head in a crown-like headscarf. Celie
does the same for her. They look like queens. They prance
around the room pr etending to be royalty.

Suddenly, Alfonso barges in. He throws a sack at Celie.

                    ALFONSO
          Pack your things, Celie! Time for
          you to leave. You marryin' Mister!

He SLAMS the door behind him. Celie is confused.

                    CELIE
          Who Mister?

                       NETTIE
          The devil.

Celie's eyes GROW big.
                                                         18.


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - STAIRWAY - MINUTES LATER

Celie carries her bags down a flight of stairs. Nettie runs
out and hands Celie her mother's sewing kit. Celie stuffs it
in her bag along with her baby's toy rattle.

                    CELIE
          Can't believes I'se gettin'
          married. You think there'll be a
          wedding?

                    NETTIE
          Considerin' he didn't even propose,
          I doubt it. Don't let him walk over
          you, hear? Keep your head held
          hi gh.

Celie nods her head "yes."

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          I'll come visit when I can. Even if
          we have to part, me and you...

                    NETTIE & CELIE
          Us have one heart.

The sisters share a tight embrace.


EXT. THE GENERAL STORE - MINUTES LATER

Mister strolls on his horse away from the store. Celie
follows on foot, carrying her sack.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DUSK

Mister ties his horse to a fence while Celie stares at the
white three-bedro om house, which sits on a hill. It has seen
better days. A porch swing hangs from a single chain. Dead
sunflowers and a sad looking tree sit in the front yard.
Celie walks up dilapidated porch steps. She enters.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - VESTIBULE - DUSK

Inside, it looks like a tornado set down. Newspapers,
clothes, paintings, furniture, and toys are strewn about.

Celie looks over the space and drops her bag in UTTER SHOCK.

                    MISTER
          If you think this is bad wait till
          you get upstairs.
                    (MORE)
                                                        19.
                     MISTER (CONT'D)
          You can get to cleanin' after you
          fix supper.
              (yelling after his kids)
          Y'all come down here and greet ya
          new momma!

MINUTES LATER:

The children stand in a single file line STARING AT CELIE as
if they want to eat her. They are: HARPO, 10, stubborn but
sweet, BUB, 8, a thief with a charming curiosity, LIL CAT, 7,
attitudinal but sharp as a tack and BABY CARRIE, 5, who sucks
her thumb when she's not show ing her toothless smile.

                    ALL THE CHILDREN
              (mean-mugging Celie)
          We'ze hungry.

Celie looks like she wants to drop dead.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

All the children are UNRULY at the dinner table save for
Harpo. He's devouring the food as if it were his last supper.
There's no place for Celie to sit, so she stands.

                    HARPO
              (with food in his mouth)
          Mercy to glory, Miss Celie. This
          food so good , it's got my eyes
          waterin'. I gots to have seconds.

He reaches for more food.

                    MISTER
          You done already had seconds.

                    HARPO
          Well thirds then.

Celie makes Harpo another plate without asking permission
from Mister. She's so busy serving folks and making sure the
youngest doesn't throw food, that she hasn't eaten herself.
The minute she turns her back, Baby Carrie tosses food at her
siblings.

Mister, who sits at the head of the table, ignores this as he
reads the paper.

                    MISTER
              (to Celie)
          When you gon' give these chill'ren
          they bath!?
                                                          20.


Frightened, they all look at Celie.

                    CELIE
          It'll have to wait `till morn, I-

-Mister BACKHANDS HER ACROSS THE FACE. She falls to the
ground. He steps over her and walks away. The children
(except for Harpo) giggle. Harpo helps her up.

                    HARPO
          You alright, Miss Celie?

She doesn't respond. Harpo pulls out a chair for her.

                    HARPO (CONT'D)
          Here. You have my plate.

Celie is too shook to thank him.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mister sits by the hearth with his banjo in his lap. He
always dreamed he'd be a famed blues musician who travelled
the world.

While he plays, the following scenes are intercut with him
playing and Celie cleaning.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - HOURS LATER

Celie tries to give the younger children baths. They end up
getting her wet, hopping out of the tub and running t hrough
the house.

-Mister is still playing banjo by the fire.

-Celie is on her knees scrubbing the hallway floor. Scrubbing
the tub. Scrubbing the bathroom sink.

-She is cleaning dishes. Scrubbing a coal stove. Sweeping the
kitchen floor.

-Mister plays even harder.

-Celie is washing the walls in the dining room. Dusting the
shelves. Polishing the silverware. Cleaning the mirrors. She
looks at her fac e in the mirror. She looks haggard.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Tired, Celie walks up the stairs. Her face is nonchalant.
                                                         21.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

She falls backward onto the bedroom mattress.

CLOSE ON: Celie's face. SHE STARES AT A FRAMED SEPIA-COLORED
PICTURE OF A BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN. It sits on the night
stand. The woman is SHUG AVERY.

IN HER IMAGINATION: AS WE PUSH INTO THE PHOTO, IT COMES TO
LIFE, REVEALING Shug Avery in a studio. She smiles. A
photographer's camera flashes.

Suddenly, we hear a thumping sound. The studio begins to
shake. We pull out of the photograph back into the bedroom.
CELIE IS BACK TO REALITY. We get the sense that Mister is
being intimate with Celie.

A glass falls and shatters from the nightstand. Mister
slides off, turn s over and falls asleep.

Celie reaches into her skirt pocket. She FINDS THE TOY
RATTLE. She holds it close to her chest and curls inside her
herself as she closes her eyes.

PRE-LAP: THE SOUND OF A TOY RATTLE!


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Celie wakes up and SEES Mister's oldest daughter, Lil Cat,
teasingly shaking the rattle in her face.

                    CELIE
          That's my baby's.

Lil Cat snickers then run s off.

TRACKING SHOT AS: Celie darts after her out of the room...


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Across the hall then down the stairs to...


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - VESTIBULE - DAY

FROM CELIE'S POV:

CAMERA SPINS AROUND as Celie REALIZES the house is AGAIN A
MESS. Bub is throwing mud on the walls and Baby Carrie is
sitting on the counter with her hands in a cake. Food,
clothes, and dishes are everywhere. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR!
                                                         22.


Celie opens it to FIND Nettie, wearing a pretty yellow dress
and carrying her bags.

                    NETTIE
          Pa tried to touch me. I can't live
          there no more.

Concerned, Celie embraces her sister.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DAY

Mister is saddling his horse while Nettie and Celie look on,
nervous.

                    MISTER
          Where she gon' sleep?

                    CELIE
          I can put the girls in the same
          room. Nettie don't mind sleeping on
          a child's bed.

                    NETTIE
          I won't be any trouble, Mister. I
          spend my days in school and at
          night I'se study.

                    MISTER
              (to Nettie)
          You gon' have to pull your weight
          `round the house. And whatever I
          say, go.

                      NETTIE
          Yes, suh.

Celie and Nettie smile at each other.

                    MISTER
          Fair `nough. I'm going to town.
          Celie, gather me some firewood bout
          time I get back.

                      CELIE
          Yes'em.

They watch as Mister gets on his horse and trots away.
                                                         23.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - VESTIBULE - MINUTES LATER

Nettie comes downstairs, having put away her bags. She
glances over the place while Celie cleans on her knees. The
children are running around and screaming like banshees.

                    NETTIE
          Celie, what you do'in?

                    CELIE
          Mister get upset if he come home
          and the place ain't sparklin'.

                    NETTIE
          Did you make this mess?

                     CELIE
          Naw but-

                     NETTIE
          -Get up.

Nettie helps her up then WHIS TLES. The children stop.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          You chill'ren come here!

The children walk to the foyer, huddled together like crabs.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          When y'all woke up this morn' was
          this place a mess?!

No response. She gets more intense!

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          I said, was it a mess?!

They shake their heads "no."

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          Then tell me how it got to look so?
          Which one of y'alls is a mess
          maker!?

They all point at one another.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          Then I sugge st all y'all get to
          cleaning! NOW!! We'll be back `fore
          long.

They hurriedly obey. Nettie grabs Celie by the arm and runs
out of the house.
                                                        24.


EXT. ROAD FROM MISTER'S HOUSE - DAY

Celie and Nettie are so happy to be back together again that
they skip away from the house, laughing. This is the first
moment of freedom that they have had in a good while.

Celie starts to head right but Nettie heads left.

                    CELIE
          Where you go'in? We'ze got to
          gather firewood `fore Mister come
          home.

                    NETTIE
          We will. But first we needs to go
          sit up in our tree. For old time's
          sake.

                     CELIE
          But Net-

Nettie grabs her by the hand and drags her along.

                    NETTIE
          Live some. We'll only be gon' a
          spell!


EXT. TREE-LINED STREET - NEARLY DUSK

The wind blows through the trees as if a spirit is dancing
above. The sisters look up at the canopy of trees. Light
trickles through the trees and paints them in a prism of
colored light. The wind raps at the tree branches setting a
beat and whi stles through leaves like a wood instrument. It
creates music - setting a melody. Nettie sings an upbeat song
to Celie, 05."KEEP IT MOVING."

                    NETTIE
          Days keep rolling by,
          Just tryna keep your head up
          Lift it to the sky
          When you get down

          But oh
          Just let it go
          Life can never break your soul


EXT. DEADWOOD BEACH - DUSK

CELIE and NETTIE run towards deadwood trees on the beach as
fireflies disperse.

                     NETTIE
          There's so much to explore
          I hear a big big big world
          Knocking at the door
          Getting a little taste
          Just leave s you wanting more
          We can't be quiet like before

          If you could be a butterfly

          Nothing's gonna take you down

Celie joins Nettie, echoing her words.
                                                          26.


             NETTIE (CONT'D)                   CELIE

They continue to sing as the sun starts to set.

            NETTIE (CONT'D)                   CELIE (CONT'D)
Everyday the sun don't shine        (in response)

                      NETTIE & CELIE
            Wherever we go
            Life can never break our soul.

CELIE and NETTIE see Mister on his horse, heading their
way. They take off running.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The girls quickly gather firewood before they run into the
house.


INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

CELIE and NETTIE hide beneath a bedsheet. They giggle. Happy
that they have outwitted Mister.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - LATER

Mister sits in his rocking chair on   his back porch, sipping
hooch and playing his banjo. NETTIE   crosses the back porch
from the outhouse wrapped in a bath   towel to her bedroom.
Mister glances at her lustfully. He   waits a beat, then -
                                                           27.


INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

Mister sneaks into the bedroom where Nettie lies asleep. She
wakes, horrified!

                     NETTIE
          What you doing!? You're married to
          my sister!

                    MISTER
          That don't mean we can't be
          friends. Let's get friendly.

She pushes him away then tries to hop out of bed.

                     MISTER (CONT'D)
              (taunting her)
          Be sweet now. Possum can't run from
          a big dog.

                       NETTIE
          Let me go!

                    MISTER
          Why you fightin'? You knows how I
          feels `bout you.

                    NETTIE
          I don't feel the same.

                    MISTER
          I got something that'll change
          that.

He starts to pull down his bottoms. She knees him in the
groin! He moans, releases her.

PRE-LAP: A SCREAM!


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Mister is INCENSED! He carries Nettie over his shoulder, in
the pouring rain as she tussles and CRIES. Celie follows
after him PLEADING.

                    CELIE
          LET HER STAY! PLEASE!

                    NET TIE
          I didn't mean it! I'se sorry!

He walks down the front steps and drops her to the ground.
                                                           28.


Celie runs to her while Mister goes back in the house.

Celie helps Nettie to her feet. Mister comes back out and
throws Nettie's belongings at her. Her books and her yellow
dress are strewn over the yard. They frantically pick up her
belongings and then suddenly...

A GUN SHOT!

CAMERA TURNS AROUND:

Mister is standing on his porch holding a rifle.

His children watch from the kitchen window.

Celie cover s Nettie's body with her own.

                    MISTER
              (to Nettie)
          Get off my land!

Mister points the gun at Celie. Nettie fearlessly pushes
Celie behind her, to guard her.

                    NETTIE
          Fine! I'm going!

Celie falls at Mister's feet.

            CELIE                          MISTER
Please, suh. Please. I beg      You ain't never gonna see or
you. Anything you want, suh.    hear from her again! `Thanks
For God sake... please.         I get for lettin' her stay
                                here. GET!!!!!

Nettie wa lks. Celie rushes to her and hugs her. Mister pulls
them apart then pushes Nettie who falls. He grabs Celie and
drags her back towards the house.

Nettie gets to her feet, proud. THE SISTERS LOCK EYES as
Nettie walks backward down the road.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          Nettie, write me!!!

                    NETTIE
          I'll write you every day! Nothin'
          but death can keep me from it!

                    MISTER
              (to Nettie)
          I said, GET! And you don't ever
          come back! Not e ver!
                                                          29.


MISTER SHOOTS HIS GUN IN THE AIR AGAIN! Nettie runs. He drags
Celie into the house. Nettie forgot HER BOOKS AND HER YELLOW
DRESS IN THE BACK YARD.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Celie falls to her knees in the rain! She sings 06."DEAR GOD-
NETTIE (LILY OF THE FIELD)."

                    CELIE
          DEAR GOD!!!?
              (to God; with tears)
          What you done with my sister? How
          this play in your plan? Won't you
          bring back my Nettie? You the only
          one who can.
          I never ask for anything but I'm
          askin' for this. If I'm really a
          lily of the field, you will answer
          my prayer. Or you're no God at ALL!


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

Celie turns and sees Mister standing on the back porch,
angry.

                     MISTER
          If s he come back here again, I'll
          kill ya both. Hear me!? I'll kill
          ya dead.

Celie walks back inside, sobbing. She feels a hand on her
shoulder. It's Harpo, staring at her with sympathetic eyes.

                    HARPO
          Here, Miss Celie.

HE HANDS HER NETTIE'S BOOK AND THE YELLOW DRESS THAT WAS
THROWN IN THE YARD. Celie holds the dress close to her, she
smells Nettie on it.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAYS LATER

CLO SE ON THE YELLOW DRESS as CELIE cuts it into squares. She
starts to sew something with her mother's spool and thread.

BEGIN TIME TRANSITION --

The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the room, as time and seasons pass
before our eyes.
                                                        30.


CELIE continues to sew what appears to be the beginnings of a
quilt. She adds pieces of her mother's dress.

CELIE continues to sew. We see the sun beaming through the
window as flowers bloom.

Celie stands up from sewing.

TITLE CARD: 1917. SEVEN YEARS LATER.

Celie has become an adult right before our eyes. She folds
the now large quilt, which is divine and shows what an
exceptional seamstress she is. She stands up to admire her
work.

                    CELIE
          So many winters grey and summers
          blue. Another endless day to suffer
          through.

She must be dead.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          What kind of God are you?


INT./EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

A bell sounds as THE POSTMAN, arrives on a US Mail Bicycle.

Mister walks down to greet him.

                    MISTER
          Looks like spring come early this
          year.

                    POSTMAN
          Small miracle if you ask me.

He hands Mister the mail then nods goodbye. Mister scans the
mail. An envelope catches his eye. Mister discretely tucks
the envelope into his pocket. He looks up to find Celie
staring at him in the front door. Mister enters the house and
puts the remaining mail on the table. Once he leaves, she
hurries over to see if there is a letter from Nettie. She
searches frantically among the mail but there is no letter.


EXT. M ISTER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - HOURS LATER

CELIE hears two people bickering down the road and sees what
appears to be a small dust storm. She realizes it's a
pregnant black woman marching up the road. This is SOFIA,
pretty and strong-willed. Harpo catches up to her.
                                                         31.


                    HARPO
          Sofia, don't go no further! Now, I
          mean it. I'm putting my foot down.

                    SOFIA
          What's that foot s'pose to do,
          Harpo? I bet it won't walk over me.

He moves aside. She continues up towards the house.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Af'noon, ma'am. Is Mister, `round?

                    CELIE
          Naw, he at the ale house.

PRE-LAP: THE LAUGHTER OF MEN.


INT. BIG SLIM'S POOL HOUSE - DAY

Inside, the ale house is thick with cigar smoke and men
playing pool. They drink corn liquor, listening to Delta
Blues on a gramophone. The owner is BIG SLIM, big body and
slim legs.

Mister sits at a table with his father OL MISTER, mean as a
wet cat. TWO OTHER MEN sit at the table. They play dominoes.
Mister SLAMS a domino down.

                    MISTER
          Give me ten like you drinkin' gin,
          when your daddy come out, guess who
          go in.

The players grumble. Now it's Ol Mister's turn.

                    OL MISTER
          I got dirty thirty, I tells no
          lies. These bones gon' make all you
          negroes cry.

He LAUGHS while he SLAMS his domino on the table and wins the
hand. The other men curse as Ol Mister takes their money.

Sofia enters with Harpo in tow. Big Slim clocks her, he's
drying a glass jar.

                    BIG SLIM
          What's wrong with you, gal? Can't
          you read?

He points to a large sign behind the bar. It says: "NO
FIGHTIN, NO KILLIN, NO WOMEN, NO CHILLEN."
                                                        32.


                    SOFIA
          I read what pleases me.

She walks up to Mister, smiling.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Howdy, suh. It's high time me and
          you was introduced. Tell him who I
          is Harpo.

Harpo takes off his hat, approaches the men.

                    HARPO
          Pa, Grampy, gents. I wants to
          introduce y'all to my girl. This
          here Sofia.

The men stare. Ol Mister let's his glasses slide to edge of
his nose as he scans her up and down.

                    OL MISTER
          That's a lot of woman.

The men giggle quietly.

                    MISTER
              (to Sofia)
          Who you kin to, girl? You seem like
          trouble.

Sofia swallows her pride.

                    SOFIA
          Naw. I'm one of Argus Butler's
          daughters. I ain't no trouble. Just
          big.

Sofia proudly rubs her belly.

                    MISTER
          Who the daddy?

                    SOFIA
          Harpo.

                    MISTER
          How we know that?

Sofia is starting to get upset.

                    SOFIA
          Harpo know, that's what matter. We
          more than just a whimsy. We'ze in
          love.
                                                        33.


                    OL MISTER
          Lawdy, this better than radio.

Harpo sits, hides his head in his hands.

                    MISTER
          I ain't lettin' my son marry you
          just `cause you in the family way.
          Pretty gal like you can take his
          mind but you can't have his money.

Sofia step closer to Mister.

                    SOFIA
          Don't matter. My sister and her
          husband say I can live with them. I
          come here out of respect but if
          there ain't none to get, there sho'
          ain't none to give. Harpo, let's
          get on up and away from here.

                    HARPO
          Comin', sugar dumplin'.

Harpo tips his hat to the men; starts to head for the door.

                    MISTER
          Boy, don't move a muscle.

Harpo freezes. Sofia puts her hand on her hips. A standoff.

                    SOFIA
          Fine. Stay then Harpo. But when you
          gets cold, you know good and well
          who heats up your bone.

Harpo blushes. The men throw up their hands and fall out of
their chairs laughing.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Don't keep me waitin'.

She leaves.

                    MISTER
          That gal ain't welcomed in my
          house.

                    HARPO
          But she carryin' my child.

                    MISTER
          Tough. She ain't worthy of you.
                                                           34.


Ol Mister defends Harpo.

                    OL MISTER
          Least she don't got the nasty
          woman's disease like your Shug
          Avery.

All the men quiet. This is clearly a tense subject.

                    OL MISTER (CONT'D)
          I hear her legs skinny like
          baseball bats and she got the body
          of a worn out mattress-

Mister slams his fist on the table!

                    MISTER
          That's enough, daddy! Play the game
          or get.

Ol Mister takes his cigar from his mouth.

                    OL MISTER
          You lucky my hand s is itchin'. I'm
          bout to take er'body's money. Here,
          Harpo.

He gives Harpo some of his earnings from the game.

                    OL MISTER (CONT'D)
          See to your family.

                    HARPO
          Bless you, gramp.

Harpo leaves. Ol Mister and Mister look at each other with
well-aged spite. The men continue the game.

PRE-LAP: The sound of loud hammering in the distance.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Celie is teaching Lil Cat and Baby Carrie how to sew the
quilt that she has been working on.

More LOUD HAMMERING! It JOLTS Mister awake who is asleep on
the couch! He looks out the window to see if he can spot
where the noise is coming from.

                    MISTER
          What in tarnation...

MORE HAMMERING! Mister heads for the front door.
                                                         35.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DAY

He marches down the road, following the loud clanging.


EXT. EDGE OF THE MANGROVE SWAMP - DAY

At the far end of his land, Mister finds Harpo hammering
wooden slats over a bog. He approaches, mad enough to spit
blood.

                    MISTER
          You get my permission to build down
          here!?

                    HARPO
          You know good and well grampy gave
          me this land when I turnt sixteen.
          I'm building me and Sofia a home on
          it.

                    MISTER
          Boy, do you carry your brains in
          your back pocket? You can't build a
          house on swampland. If you was
          smart you'd use it to plant rice.

                    HARPO
          Well maybe I ain't smart.

                     MISTER
          That's bout the wisest thing you
          done said-

                    HARPO
          Maybe I got a dumb heart cause I'se
          in love.

                    MISTER
          You ain't in love. You just in way
          over your head. All the learnin' I
          put inside you and you still don't
          know how to be a man-

                    HARPO
          I'm buildin' my woman a house, Pa!
          You can help me if you want. If
          not, well... this conversation gon'
          be shorter than the time it took
          you to walk down here.

They stare each other down. Normally, Harpo would give in but
his love for Sofia has changed him. HE'S BECOME A NEW MAN.
                                                        36.


Mister, upon realizing his son won't surrender, grunts then
marches back home.

Time passes. The sound of hammering and sawing set a
percussive beat. Harpo's friends are helping him build his
house while they sing a rousing work song. 07. "HARPO WORK
SONG."

                    HARPO (CONT'D)
          I been working and working and
          woking

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Uh-huh

                    HARPO
          Till the sun go down

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Till the sun go down

                    HARPO

          corner

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Uh-huh

                    HARPO
          Looking so fine

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Looking so fine

                    HARPO
          Lawd if I ever get my hand on a
          dollar

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Uh-huh

                    HARPO
          Bet I'll blow her mind

                    HARPO'S FRIENDS
          Bet I'll blow her mind

                    HARPO
          Till then I guess I'll just keep
          working

SOFIA AND HER SIX SISTERS arrive in an horse-driven wagon to
help Harpo build. Even though the Butler women wear skirts,
they are not strangers to hard labor. They join in.
                                                          37.


THE SUN GOES DOWN as Harpo and Sofia sit on the deck admiring
their almost complete house.


EXT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - DAY (SEVERAL MONTHS LATER)

Celie is taking a good look at the facade. The home is raised
several feet above water by wooden stilts. It is well-
constructed and quaint.

Sofia answers the door holding her newborn baby. She FINDS
Celie standing outside with gifts.

                     SOFIA
          Miss Celie!
              (call ing to Harpo)
          Harpo, we got comp'ny!
              (to Celie)
          Come, on in!

Celie enters.


INT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

There are three rooms, a small kitchen, and a sitting room
inside the house. Inside, it's modest but comfy.

                    CELIE
          I sewed you curtains for the house
          and a blanket for the baby.

She shows Sofia the curtains and blanket.

                    SOFIA
          Don't this beat the band. Harpo
          said you could do magi c with a
          needle but I do declare...
              (calling after him)
          Harpo! I said, we got comp'ny!

Harpo appears.

                    HARPO
          Have mercy, I'm right here.

                    SOFIA
          Take the baby. Me and Miss Celie
          need to converse like womens. Make
          us tea.

The ladies sit.
                                                      38.


                    HARPO
          I'm holding the baby. How I'm
          s`pose to make tea and hold the
          baby?

                    CELIE
          I'll make it.

Celie starts to get up.

                    SOFIA
          No, you won't neither. You a guest.
          Harpo, hand me the baby then go
          make tea.

Harpo walks away, annoyed. Sofia smiles at Celie.

                     SOFIA (CONT'D)
          I'm so tickled you come by. You my
          only friend in these parts. Mister
          still won't let me in his house.
          How you managed to be so nice when
          the rest o f Harpo's kin is mean and
          surly?

                    CELIE
          Don't know. I fig-

                    SOFIA
          -Maybe you too nice. If I was you,
          I'd up and left already. You must
          ain't got no kinfolk `round these
          parts.

                    CELIE
          Only kin that cared for me was my
          sister. But I ain't heard from her
          in ages. Figure she dead.

                    SOFIA
          That's sad. You wanna make my
          wedding dress? I'll pay you good
          money for it.

                    CELIE
          ...sho. I guess...

Harpo enters with tea. He hands each of them a cup.

                    HARPO
          Tea.

                    SOFIA
          How come it ain't hot?
                                                          39.


                    HARPO
          You didn't say hot.

                    SOFIA
          Tea got to be hot, Harpo!

                    HARPO
          Don't sass me in front of comp'ny!

Sofia stands up to face him, still holding the baby. They
look as if they about to fight but suddenly they kiss. Celie
smiles then covers her mouth. They still kissing.

                                               MATCH CUT TO:


INT. THE CHURCH - DAY (A YEAR LATER)

TITLE CARD: SPRING OF 1919.

CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing Harpo kissing Sofia at their
weddi ng. She is still holding the baby. They have just tied
the knot. Attendees cheer!

                    REVEREND AVERY
          "What God hath joined together, let
          no man put asunder."

SOFIA'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY glares at Mister, who sits next to
Celie on the other side of the church, asleep and SNORING.

A band enters the chapel, playing as attendees throw rice
when Harpo and Sofia come together dancing.

                    SOFIA
          I'se married now!

Celie looks on, happy for them but wishing she had a love of
her own.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - SEVERAL NIGHTS LATER

Mister is w ith Celie in bed while she again stares at THE
FRAMED SEPIA-PICTURE OF SHUG. Without thinking she says:

                    CELIE
          Who this in the picture?

                    MISTER
          That's Shug. Woman I shoulda
          married.
                                                        40.


                    CELIE
          She pretty.

                    MISTER
          I knows it. Now shut up.

Mister slams the picture down.

Later, when he is asleep, Celie secretly looks at the
picture. The picture remains still. Celie smiles.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Celie comes downstairs in her night robe to make Mister
coffee. She spots Harpo sitting at the dining table nursing a
golfball-sized knot on his forehead with ice wrap ped in
cloth.

                    CELIE
          I take it you and Miss Sofia having
          a rough honeymoon?

                    HARPO
          How come I can't get her to mind me
          like you do Pa?

                    CELIE
          Don't know. Every woman ain't the
          same. You want coffee?

                    HARPO
          I wants her to jump when I say.

                    CELIE
          Maybe she ain't a jumpin' woman.

                    HARPO
          I fear we ain't gon' last. She mean
          as a train but I loves her. What's
          I'm gon' do?

Celie shrugs. A pause, then...

                      CELIE
          Beat her.

The w ords sit on Harpo like a thick coat of sweat.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Something moves with determination through the grass.
                                                           41.


CLOSE ON Sofia's BOOTS TRAMPING ACROSS THE DIRT.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Celie is taking down bedsheets, folding them, and putting
them in a basket.

The silhouette of Sofia moves behind the hung linens and
SEEMS TO GROW IN SIZE THE CLOSER SHE GETS TO CELIE.

Then she BURSTS through the sheets like a mighty wind,
startling Celie. SOFIA HAS A BLACK EYE.

                    SOFIA
          You told Harpo to beat me?

                       CELIE
          No, ma'am.

                    SOFIA
          You'ze a damn lie!

Sofia moves in closer. Celie backs up for dear life.

                    CELIE
              (ashamed)
          I didn't mean it if'in I-

                    SOFIA
          Why you fix your mouth to say it!?

                    CELIE
          Don't know. I say it `cause... I'se
          a fool. `Cause I jealous of you.
          You do what I can't. You fight.

Sofia sucks her teeth. Thinks. She walks away. Celie sighs,
thinking she is safe. Suddenly, Sofia is back.

                    SOFIA
          I loves Harpo. God kn ows I do. But
          I'll kill him dead 'fo I let him or
          anybody beat me!

Celie nods, indicating an apology. Sofia sings 08."HELL NO."

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          All my life I've had to fight! I
          had to fight my daddy! I had to
          fight my brothers, my cousins, my
          uncles too! But I never, never,
          never, never, never, never thought.
          I'd have to fight in my own house!
                                                           42.


MUSIC KICKS IN. Sofia pulls down a sheet that is in her way
and shoves it at Celie. She hasn't come to hurt her because
they are good friends, but she feels betrayed. Celie puts the
sheet in a basket. Suddenly, Sofia grabs Celie's hand and
takes her down the road toward her and Harpo's house.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          I feel sorry for you, to tell you
          the truth. You remind me of my
          mama!

Celie looks back at her house, worried about where Sofia is
taking her, or what she has in mind.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Under yo' husband's thumb, naw. You
          under yo' husband's foot!
          What he say go! Why you so scared
          I'll never know. But if a man raise
          his hand... Hell no!


EXT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

ALL SIX OF SOFIA'S SISTERS show up in two horse buggies as
Celie and Sofia are waiting. The sisters bail out. They march
into the hous e.

           SISTERS                            SOFIA
Hell, hell... hell no!          Hell no!
Hell, hell... hell no!


INT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Sofia dresses her baby as her sisters start to collect ALL
her belongings. They work fast and efficiently.

                    SOFIA
          Girl child ain't safe in a family
          `o mens! Sick and tired how a woman
          still live like a slave. Oh, you
          better learn how to fight back
          While you still alive!

Everybod y moves around Celie, who is too frightened to do
anything.


INT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Sofia packs a suitcase and throws everything in it. Celie
looks on.
                                                          43.


                      SOFIA
            You show them, girl, and beat back
            that jive! `Cause when a man just
            don't give a damn... Hell no!

                                               SOFIA (CONT'D)
             SISTERS
Hell,   hell... hell   no!         Hell, no!
Hell,   hell... hell   no!         No, No, No, No.
Hell,   hell... hell   no!         Hell, no!
Hell,   hell... hell   no!

MINUTES LATER:

Sofia clocks a photo of her and Harpo hanging on the wall.
She contemplates taking it.

                      SOFIA
            No, when that man used to touch me.
            He'd climb on top and start to rock
            me away. Lord knows I still loves
            him.

She decides not to take it when she sees her reflection in
the glass of the picture and clocks THE BLACK EYE.

                      SOFIA (CONT'D)
            But he tried to make me mind
            And I just ain't that kind...

She puts the picture back on the wall.

                        SOFIA (CONT'D)
            Hell no!


INT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Each of her sisters carry big items out of the house:
furniture, pots and pans, clothes, etc. Harpo enters. HE HAS
TWO KNOTS ON HIS FOREHEAD.

                      SISTERS
            Hell, hell... hell no.

Sister #1 drops the plate on the ground and keeps moving.
Harpo clea ns the mess.


INT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Celie sits on Sofia's suitcase so she can close it.
                                                         44.


                    SOFIA
              (to Celie)
          Don't be no fool. Don't waste your
          time.

                    SISTERS
              (taking the welcome mat)
          Hell, hell... hell no.

                                           SISTERS (CONT'D)

Any man that hurts you ain't    Hell, hell... hell no.
worth a dime. Yeah, yeah,
yeah

Celie carries the suitcase outside for Sofia.


EXT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

All of the sisters gather the last of Sofia's things then hop
back into the horse and buggy.

Sofia steps out of t he house, still holding her baby. Harpo
hugs her. She has a moment of weakness but Sister #6
intervenes.

                    SOFIA
              (to Celie)
          You too good for that man.

Sister #6 (the strongest) pulls her apart from Harpo.

                    SISTERS
          Hell, hell... hell no.

                     SOFIA
          Hell no.

Sofia hops aboard the wagon with her baby.

                     SOFIA (CONT'D)
               (to Celie)
          You got to say
          You need to say
          You better say
          You oughta say
          Yeah

Sister #6 tears Harpo's house apart, tak ing pieces of a wall
and a window and puts it in the wagon!

                     SISTERS
          Hell.
                                                         45.


Sofia and Celie embrace goodbye. When Harpo looks over the
house, THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING BUT WALLS!


EXT. HARPO & SOFIA'S HOUSE - DAY

The sisters sing as they load into the wagon and ride off.

                    SOFIA
          Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell!

                    SOFIA AND SISTERS
          No!!

Sofia and her sisters ride away in a cloud of dust.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - MINUTES LATER

Celie and Harpo walk into the backyard. Miste r is sitting on
the porch playing his banjo. He plays the same song we heard
in an earlier scene. He sees his son bruised - both
physically and emotionally.

                    MISTER
          What happened to you?

                    HARPO
          Kicked by a mule.

                    MISTER
          Was this mule wearing a dress?

Harpo sits on the steps as Celie goes inside.

                     MISTER (CONT'D)
          You gon' be alright. Some women you
          just can't tame.
              (then)
          Might as well turn that home you
          built into a s moke house now. Me
          and you can grow us some tobacca.

Celie tends to Harpo's bruises.

                    HARPO
          Thinkin' bout turnin' it into a
          juke joint.

                    MISTER
          Juke joint? People don't want to
          dance by no smelly swamp.
                                                        46.


                    CELIE
          Unless Shug Avery singing there.

Mister and Harpo look at each other then at Celie. She grins.
She knows she just got them both excited.

PRE-LAP: SOUND OF HUNDREDS OF STARLINGS LILTING IN THE NIGHT!

TITLE CARD: SPRING OF 1922.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

Celie sews with Baby Carrie. She is now 17 and Celie is 27.

They hear a CHOIR OF ROBINS in the sky!

                       CELIE
          Stay here.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DUSK

Celie walks outside. The sky seems to be thick with rolling
mud. She takes a closer look and SEES THOUSANDS OF STARLINGS
covering the sky. The sight chills her.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Townspeople in the streets look up and see rounds of
SHRIEKING STARLINGS. They stand in the road looking up in
awe. The STARLINGS blot out the sky, causing total darkness.


EXT. REVEREND AVERY'S HOUS E - NIGHT

Reverend Avery, First Lady, and several townspeople rush out
of their homes to the front of Reverend Avery's House, to
look at the sky.

                    FIRST LADY
          Reverend husband? I thinks you was
          right about these being the last
          days.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          Lord of mercy. Of all the things to
          be right about.

He looks down the road and sees HEADLIGHTS FOLLOWED BY THE
BLARE OF A CAR HORN - it sounds like a lonely jazz trumpet.
                                                         47.


                    FIRST LADY
          Who that comin' yonder?

Reverend sees her before anyone else.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          God help me. It's my daughter.

EVERYONE GASPS! They part to make a path for a 1921
KENWORTHY. It's being driven slowly by a good-looking man.

INSIDE, A STUNNING BLACK WOMAN SITS IN THE BACK SEAT. She is
SHUG AVERY, 33, with ruby-red lips and a face hiding beneath
a handsome wide-brim hat with a long hat pin. She se es her
father, the Reverend, and quickly rolls down the window.

                    SHUG
          Howdy, Pa. How ya be?

The Reverend turns his head in anger. First Lady, Shug's step-
mother, cuts her eyes at her. Shug raises the window. She
then sits back and takes a long pull from her flask. Then she
turns on the radio. Jazz plays.

The townspeople sing 09."SHUG AVERY COMIN' TO TOWN."


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

A beat is set by SHOE SHINERS (or BOOT BLACKS) hitting rags
against the tips of dress shoes.

Several men rush into A BARBERSHOP wanting a haircut!

                    MALE ENSEMBLE (3)

                                                         48.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS are PANICKED. A woman drags her husband
from the barbershop. Another chases him from the suit store
with a rolling pin.


    1 FEMALE ENSEMBLE (5)          2 FEMALE ENSEMBLE (10)
She's a trollop in a tight     Cryin' shame. Shug's her

          When Shug come across that county
          line. County line. Oh.

Shug Avery's car pulls onto the street. A crowd forms.

                    ENSEMBLE
          Shug Avery comin' to town. Shug
          Avery comin' to town.

                    FEMALE ENSEMBLE

          to town. You know that she's
          comin'.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

FROM ABOVE:

Celie stands at the window looking out. She picks up Shug's
photograph.
                                                        49.


                    CELIE
          Got about a million questions.
          Rollin' around my head. What she
          wear? How her hair? Is she skinny?
          Is she stout? Must be somethin' to
          fuss about.

Mister bursts through the door, half-dressed with half a sock
on and trying to tie a tie. Celie quickly puts the picture
back and helps him.

                    MISTER
          Ain't no other woman like Shug.
          Don't you know it ain't no lie.
          When Shug come across that county
          lin e.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

A car horn BLARES transporting us back to the crowded street.

All the young people march down the street to catch up with
Shug's car.

Once this beat is set, everyone feels the rhythm in their
bones and dances toward Shug's car.


EXT./INT. SHUG'S CAR - END OF MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Inside, Shug is drinking herself into a stupor and still
listening to the radio. She is oblivious to the townspeople
dancing up the road, toward her car.


EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Women in fine dresses high-step out of a boutique in heels.

They get closer to Shug's vehicle.

                    FEMALE ENSEMBLE
          Ooh, that Shug. You know she no
          good. A snake in the woods, gonna
          poison you.

                    MALE ENSEMBLE
          You don't understand what it do to
          a man when you in her hands and she
          turn that screw.
                                                          50.


                    FEMALE ENSEMBLE
          Better say farewell, 'cuz you're
          goin' to hell!

                    MALE ENSEMBLE
          But a man feel swell when he in her
          spell.

                    FEMALE ENSEMBLE
          Better lock your doors!

                    MALE ENSEMBLE
          Better change your drawers!

The men run toward Shug's car. The women chase after them!

                    ENSEMBLE
          She's coming, comin', comin',
          comin'. Shug Avery comin' to town!

                               Shug Avery!


EXT. END OF MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The townspeople finally arrive at the car. They think Shug is
going to get out to greet them.

                    ENSEMBLE 1/ ENSEMBLE 2/ ENSEMBLE 3
              (tiered)
          Comin'/ Comin'/ Comin'

Suddenly the driver speeds off, leaving the townspeople
behind. Everyone is stunned.
                                                         51.


                    ENSEMBLE
              (confused)
          Comin' to town.

MUSIC STOPS.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA STAYS with Shug as her driver takes her up to Mister's
place. When they arrive, Mister and Celie greet her.

Shug steps out of the car, drunk, but tries to stand tall
like a queen. The minute she and MISTER LOCK EYES, she faints
into his arms. Celie GASPS!

                    MISTER
              (to Celie)
          Grab her legs!

Mister and Celie carry Shug upstairs.

                    CELIE
          What's wrong with her?

                    MISTER
          Nothin'. She just gets thirsty and
          likes to drink a little.

She burps. The smell is awful.

                    MISTER (CONT'D)
          Watch her head.

They take her into the house as Shug's driver speeds away.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Celie wakes. To her surprise Mister is not i n bed. She smells
something burning. She hurries downstairs.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

She rushes into the kitchen. It is filled with smoke. Mister
is at the stove burning food. He puts the burnt and blackened
food onto a plate and carries it up to Shug.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Celie is intrigued. She sits on the bottom stair and waits
while she darns socks.
                                                         52.


She hears Mister knock on Shug's door.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

A beat, then CRASH! Shug throws the plate against the wall.

                    SHUG
          You tryin' to poison me!

                    MISTER
          It ain't too bad, baby, if'in you
          put some hot sauce on it.

                    SHUG
          Oh, I got your hot sauce!

Shug slams the door in his face. He stumbles down the stairs
and rushes back into the kitchen.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Miste r is back behind the coal stove trying to fry eggs when
Celie enters. He cracks an egg. The yolk lands on his shoe.

                      MISTER
          Hot nuts!

Celie steps beside him and cracks an egg with one hand in a
quick motion like a master chef. The action stuns Mister. He
steps aside and lets her continue.

SERIES OF SHOTS: Celie makes pancakes and drops biscuits.
She fries fat back and grits. She makes scrambled eg gs with
cheese, peppers, and onions. She squeezes fresh orange juice
into a glass. She cuts up fruit.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Celie walks upstairs with a new tray of food. Everything is
cooked to perfection. Mister puts a red flower sticking out
of a tin can on the tray. Then he waits downstairs, listening
and waiting for Shug's reaction.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Stil l holding the tray, Celie knocks on the door.

                    SHUG (O.C.)
          Didn't I say I wasn't hungry!
                                                         53.


Celie cracks open the door then slides the tray of food
through. She quickly closes the door and hides behind a
corner in case the food is tossed again. But nothing happens.

MANY MINUTES LATER:

The door opens and the tray slides back out. THE PLATES HAVE
BEEN LICKED CLEAN. Even the flower is gone. Celie smiles.

PRE-LAP: BLUES PLAYS ON A GRAMOPHONE.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - HOURS LATER

Celie si ts at the bottom of the stairs, STILL SEWING HER
QUILT. It is even more intricate. She hears from upstairs:

                    SHUG (O.C.)
          I'm out of giggle water! Somebody
          fetch me a bottle in town.

                    MISTER
          Right away, baby.

Mister dashes down the stairs and bolts out the front door.

SECONDS LATER:

The music from Shug's gramophone stops.

                    SHUG
          Somebody come turn my crank!

Celie moves up the stairs. She cracks open the bathroo m door.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

She enters quietly. The room is foggy from cigarette smoke
and steamy from the hot bath.

Shug soaks in the tub with one leg leaning over the rim and a
cigarette dangling from her fingers. She has the flower from
earlier in her hair. Her eyes are closed.

Celie is too timid to look at her. Instead, she stares at the
gramophone with curiosity. She's never seen one up close.

                    SHUG
          Don't just stare at it! Turn the
          handle!

Celie turns the crank. A ragtime instrumental plays. Celie's
eyes light up. She tiptoes back toward the door.
                                                           54.


                       SHUG (CONT'D)
             Where you goin'? I need somebody to
             wash my back!

Celie freezes. She sees a clean rag on the sink. She grabs it
and kneels near the tub, all the while keeping her gaze on
the ceiling. She dips the rag in water, bathes Shug's back.

Shug moans. She presses the rag deeper and lets hot water
drip down Shug's neck. Shug sighs. Celie musters the courage
to look at her. Shug has her eyes closed.

IMAGI NED:

Celie imagines that she is kneeling by the tub with Shug
still in it, but they are spinning on a HUGE GRAMOPHONE.
Celie sings 10."DEAR GOD - SHUG" as she bathes her back.

                       CELIE
             Got about a million tingles
             Sneakin' on up my spine.

Larger-than-normal soap bubbles rise from the tub and float
around the room.

                       CELIE (CONT'D)
             I wash her body and it feel like
             I'm prayin'.

The bubbles reflect Shug's sleeping face.

                       CELIE (CONT'D)
             Try not to look, but my eyes ain't
             obeyin'. Guess I found out what all
             of the fuss is about.

Celie is standing, spinning on the record. She is a vision!
Bubbles now float out of the horn of the gramophone.

                       CELIE (CONT'D)
             Shug Avery!

The bubbles reflect an image of Shug and Celie embracing each
other.

                       CELIE (CONT'D)
             This who they talkin' `bout. And
             everything they say is true too.
             Shug Avery!

Suddenly, we hear the skipping of a record.

                                                SMASH CUT TO:
                                                        55.


BACK TO REALITY: Celie wakes from her daydream and turns
the record off. It wakes Shug. When Celie turns around the
women are facing each other.

                    SHUG
          You sho' is ugly!

Shug releases a wild laugh!

PRE-LAP: The sound of Shug humming.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - HOURS LATER

Shug is sitting on the floor between Celie's legs, dressed in
a nightgown, humming a melody that will later be "Miss
Celie 's Blues." Celie sits on the bed and combs her hair.

                    SHUG
          You got good hands. You scratched a
          song right outta my head.

She hums a little more, then...

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          How long you and Albert been a
          thang?

                    CELIE
          Albert?

                    SHUG
          Your husband. You tryin' to tell me
          you don't know your own husband's
          name?

                    CELIE
          Thought his name was Mister-

                     SHUG
          Mister ain't no name, it's a title.
          Just another way of sayin' "master"
          if you as k me. That man can't stand
          up to his own daddy but got
          everybody callin' him mister like
          he the only one in town.

                    CELIE
          Let him tell it, he'll try to
          convince you he is. And don't let
          him put on a suit. That man will
          start high-steppin' and talkin'
          proud like butter don't melt in his
          mouth.
                                                         56.


Shug laughs with a scream, then leans her head against
Celie's knee, gazing at her face.

                    SHUG
          How come you don't laugh none? If
          you ain't gon' laugh, you need to
          sell your funny bone.

Celie grins.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          And got the brightest beam this
          side of the Mason Dixon!

Celie covers her mouth. Shug takes her hand away.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          Smile. It's healthy. Ain't you got
          somethin' to make you hop out of
          bed every mornin' and just smile?
          Ain't you got chill'en?

A beat, then...

                    CELIE
          Had two. But they was taken. Don't
          know where they is or if they even
          alive.

Shug lays her head back on Celie's knee.

                    SHUG
          When you think about `em does your
          heart get full like the first time
          you held `em?

Celie thinks, then...

                    CELIE
          Yes, ma'am.

                     SHUG
          Then they still alive. It's
          nature's way of telephonin'. That's
          how I know my pa still in this
          world . `Cause when I think about
          him. And how he used to sing to me
          when I was a little bit. My heart
          gets so full...

                    CELIE
          Why come you just don't visit `im?
          He just live yonder by the church-
                                                           57.


Shug rises, looks in a mirror and puts lipstick on.

                    SHUG
          He don't want to see me. He ain't
          forgave me for choosin' The Blues
          over his religion. Funny thing is,
          God ain't never left me. Figure if
          God can understand why I sing The
          Blues... maybe one day my pa will.

Shug puts lipstick on Celie's lips then places her in front
of the mirror.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          Come. Let's see that smile in
          color.

Nervous, Celie looks in the mirror. She forces a grin.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          Sweet and loving God. Now we
          talkin'. Albert won't be able to
          keep his hands off you.

Celie quickly rubs the lipstick off.

                    CELIE
              (disgusted)
          Maybe we should try another color.

Shug tickles her, laughing. Celie releases a full smile.
They've bonded.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - HOURS LATER

A SONG FROM THE PERIOD PLAYS ON THE GRAMOPHONE. Mister and
Shug slow danc e. Celie sits, staring at their feet. She looks
up. Shug and Mister are kissing. She drops her head.

Suddenly, Mister's pants drop. Then Shug's dress. Now Celie
is too afraid to look up. She walks to the door with her head
bowed. Just before she closes the door, she catches Mister
kissing Shug's neck while Shug STARES AT HER. THEIR EYES
LOCK. Celie closes the door. She is both jealous and aroused.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NEXT DAY

IT'S THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE SUMMER! Mister is sitting on his
porch steps with his chest bare, rubbing ice cubes on his
neck. Ol Mister saunters up the walk with his cane, wearing a
three-piece-suit, a tie, and a straw hat. They say mean
people don't sweat. Here's an example.
                                                        58.


                    OL MISTER
          Heard your ho done come back and
          brought the plagues.

                    MISTER
          Don't start that foolishness, pa.

                    OL MISTER
          You ain't seen them robins covering
          the sky last week? Heard that's
          when she arrived.

Ol Mister slaps the back of his neck - killing a mosquito.

                    OL MISTER (CONT'D)
          Not to mention the swarms of
          `squitos and this here heat wave.
          The woman's cursed. She'll be the
          death of us all.

Celie walks outside.

                    CE LIE
          You wanna glass of water, Ol
          Mister?

                    OL MISTER
          Don't mind if I do.

Ol Mister walks up to the porch to get some shade.

                    OL MISTER (CONT'D)
          When I look o'er this land, I think
          of my daddy who slaved it from when
          he was a boy till his body went to
          the dust. Even after he got his
          freedom he sharecropped it and
          saved every penny so he could buy
          it from the white family that sold
          his mother for two pigs and a bag
          of meal. Now you bringin' your
          whore on the same land your kinfolk
          bled and died for. It be a doggone
          shame.

                    MISTER
          Shug ain't no whore, she got a wild
          heart like me. You ain't got the
          head to understand it but I ain't
          never stopped lovin' her. Shoulda
          married her when I had the chance.
                                                         59.


                    OL MISTER
          Is that what this `bout? Love? That
          mess less reliable than rain. Land
          the only thing a colored man can
          count on. Land can grow green and
          put green in your pockets. You
          wanna love somethin', love this
          land.

Celie is behind the porch screen. SHE SPITS IN OL MISTER'S
WATER THEN STIRS IT WITH HER FINGER. She walks back outside.

                    CELIE
          Here you are. I sweetened it for
          ya.

                    OL MISTER
          Celie, you has my sympathies. Ain't
          many a woman would allow they
          husband's ho to lay up in they
          house. Eatin' they food, spreadin'
          legs-

                    MISTER
          Time for you to go, daddy.

Mister grabs his father by the arm.

                    OL MISTER
          Can't I drink my water first?!

Mister pauses. Ol Mister clears his throat then takes his
sweet time swallowing the water in one gulp. Celie hides her
grin. He hands her the glass then walks back the way he came.

He smacks another mosquito on his neck. They watch him leave.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - CELIE'S GARDEN - NEXT DAY

Celie and Shug pick peas.

                    SHUG
          I don't know nothin bout pickin'
          peas. How you know which one is
          ripe?

                    CELIE
          Got to feel `em. They like some
          people. If they rough around the
          edges, it usually means they soft
          inside. Taste this one.

She hands Shug a pea from her lap. Shug eats. It's deli cious.
                                                        60.


                    SHUG
          That's a piece of heaven.

                    CELIE
          You ain't see nothin. Come on...

Celie lifts Shug to her feet.


EXT. FIELD OF HIGH GRASS - DUSK

They walk carrying goods in a basket. Shug smells and picks
flowers. We start the scene in medias res:

                    SHUG
          More than anything, God love
          admiration.

                    CELIE
          You sayin' God is vain?

                    SHUG
          Not vain, Miss Celie. God just
          wants to share a good thing. I
          think it pisses God off if you wa lk
          by the color purple in a field and
          don't notice it.

                    CELIE
          You sayin' God wants to be loved
          like it say in The Bible?

                    SHUG
          Everything wants to be loved.
          `Specially God. That's why God be
          in everything. `Cause the more you
          love what God made, the more you is
          lovin' God and God lovin' you. God
          be in music, water, in sunlight.
          God be... big like the sky yet
          small enough to live in our hearts.

                     CELIE
          Bee n wonderin' if God love me, why
          he let my babies be takin' and why
          he take my Nettie.

                    SHUG
          Sound like men did that. Not God.

Shug spots A RARE PURPLE CROCUS FLOWER in the field. THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME WE SEE THE COLOR PURPLE IN THE FILM. She
plucks the flower then hands it to Celie.
                                                           61.


CLOSE ON CELIE smelling the flower as a honey-tinted red
sunset spreads like open arms across the sky.


EXT. DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE JUKE JOINT - DUSK

Celie and Shug walk to Harpo's juke joint. One can hear
crickets greasing their legs under the blush of the moon.


EXT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - DUSK

Harpo and his buddies are almost done building the juke.
SQUEAK is helping them. She hangs on Harpo, which in dicates
they are an item. Shug can't keep her eyes off the handsome,
sweaty men. Harpo walks toward her and Celie.

                    SHUG
              (to Harpo)
          Good to see you not just followin'
          in your pa's footsteps. But
          building something of your own.
          This gon' be nice.

                    HARPO
          Thank ya, Miss Shug. We open Friday
          night. Was hopin' you might come by
          and sang a little-

                    SQUEAK
          But if you can't, don't worry.
          `Cause I gots a voice too.

The men grumble. Squeak cuts her eyes at them.

                    SHUG
          Sounds nice.

Shug gets a closer look at the bare-chested men.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
              (flirtatiously)
          You men gon' be ready for me come
          Fri-dee?

The men take off their hats, out of respect.

                    HARPO'S BUDDIES
          Sho ma'am/God's my witness/Bet my
          house.

                    SHUG
          Well alright. I guess I'm singing.
                                                        62.


They cheer! She takes Celie's hand and they walk off.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NEXT DAY

Harpo and his buddies hang signs over town. They read: "COME
SEE SHUG SING THE BLUES, FRIDAY NIGHT DOWN AT HARPO'S JUKE."

Townspeople read the sign and take note.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - NIGHT

Celie helps Shug step into an exquisite dress. There is a
palpable chemistry between them.

                    SHUG
          Tell me the truth, yo u mind if
          Albert sleep with me?

                    CELIE
          Naw. It keep him off me.

                    SHUG
          Why you say it like that? You don't
          like layin' with him?

                     CELIE
          Most time I pretend I ain't even
          there. He don't know the
          difference.
              (then)
          You love 'im?

Shug shrugs.

                    SHUG
          I gots what you call a passion for
          him. He smell right. Makes me laugh
          some. Sometime it just feel good
          being with somebody who loves you
          unconditional.

                    CELIE
          That do sou nd nice.

Shug dabs perfume on her neck.

                    SHUG
          I laid you out somethin' on the
          bed.

Celie looks at the dress. It's really fancy.
                                                        63.


                    CELIE
          My, that's fancy. But it ain't me.
          I'll look silly-

Celie puts it down. Shug puts it back in her arms.

                    SHUG
          Put it on. You gon' be my guest
          tonight. Gots to look like we
          belong.

Celie is speechless. This is the first time Shug has hinted
that there is something between them.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Mister is waiting downstairs when Celie walks down. SHE IS A
VISION. Shug has completely dolled her up. Mister can hardly
speak.

                    CELIE
          Shug said for us to go on ahead.
          She wanna make an entrance.

Mister is disappointed. He wanted to walk to the juke with
Shug on his arm. He and Celie leave the house.


EXT. DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

They walk together in silence. Mister carries an oil lamp to
guide their way. Fireflies float around them. Couples,
holdin g hands and kissing one another, pass Celie and Mister
on their way to the juke. Celie keeps her eyes to the ground.
Mister looks at trees. This is awkward for them.


EXT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

People sit on the roof fanning themselves with their own
hats. An old man chews snuff as he fishes from a tree. An
inebriated woman hangs out of a window drinking moonshine.

Celie and Mister arrive. Mister helps her into the juke via a
plank walkway.


INT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

Inside, the place is packed. Folks sit on tables, chairs, and
each other. The piano player plays a rag. People are waiting
for Shug.
                                                           64.


Harpo guides Celie and Mister to the best seats - front and
center. Suddenly, everyone hears a commotion coming from up
river. They rush to the windows to see what it is.


EXT. DOWN THE MANGROVE SWAMP - NIGHT

We see flickering lights coming from something floating
upstream toward the juke. Before we can make it out, we hear
Shug's voice. She loudly sings 11."PUSH DA BUTTON" .

                    SHUG
          Now there's somethin' 'bout good
          lovin' that all you ladies should
          know.

We hear instruments blaring as we see paper water candles
floating on the swamp in front of a large log raft.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          If you wanna light yo' man on fire
          You gotta start it real slow.

A HORN SECTION on the raft come into view. There's a trumpet
player, a trombone player, and a sax player. They play their
hearts out while Shug is lit by lantern light. Her face is
hidden behind a large, opulent fan made of peacock fathers.

                                                SHUG (CONT'D)
            HARPO
It's Shug! Everybody, Shug's       Keep on turnin' up that
on the water!                      voltage `til that man begin
                                   to glow. Like you switchin'
                                   on a light bulb: watch the
                                   juice begin to flow!

Shug closes the fan, revealing her face which is half-covered
by a feathery peacock hat. She looks divine. Folks go wild!


E XT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

The raft is docked. Harpo takes Shug's hand and helps her
onto land. The crowd parts as she makes her way toward the
juke entrance while people cheer her on.


INT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

Shug enters the juke gyrating her body, using her fan like a
vaudeville dancer and flirting with the men, driving them
crazy. One man slides between her legs. She pulls him up by
h is ears, drawing him toward her breasts. When he gets close
to kissing her, she pushes him away. He pretends to faint.
                                                        65.


                    SHUG
          Now that I've got your attention.
          Here's what you men need to hear:
          You want your lady racin' witchu.
          You gotta get her in gear! Well.

          Here's the key to rev her motor.
          Find the spot she love the best. If
          you don't know where it is, give
          her the stick! She'll do the rest!

She separates a man who is dancing with a woman. She dances
with the woman instead then makes her way to the...

MAKESHIFT STAG E:

When she gets to the stage, the band is already there
playing. Mister and Celie are still sitting front and center.
She winks at Celie and hands her the fan. Everyone in the
juke dances to the music.

                    SHUG & ENSEMBLE
          Push da button!(Push da button!)
          Push da button!(Push da button!)
          You gotta push it if you wanna come
          in!

Men spin women around tables. Folks leap over tables.

                    SHUG & ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
          Oh! Push da button! (Push da
          button!) Give me somethin'! (Push

          feel the train a comin' yo' way!
          (wooh wooh) Baby, push da button
          and pull the window shade!

Men lift Shug on top of the table where Celie and Mister sit.
Women jump on men's backs. Some men jump in women's laps.
Everyone is drinking moonshine and singing along.

                    SHUG & ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
          Now listen all you red-hot lovers.
          You oughta know what to do! (You
          oughta know what to do!)
          There ain't nothin' wrong with
          nothin'. That's right with both of
          you! (That's right with both of
          you!) So when tonight, you make ya
          lover cry out like a lion roar.
          Tell your neighbors your new kitty
          found the cream (oohhhh) it's

                                                         66.


Shug sings to Celie.

                    SHUG & ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
          Hey, push da button! (Push da
          button!)Push da button! (Push da

          comin' yo' way! Baby, push da
          button and pull down the window
          shade. Come on and...

DANCE BREAK: A beat dr ops in the music. Shug stomps her foot
and everyone follows suit, stomping their feet. A feeling of
euphoric ecstasy fills the space as people give in to carnal
desire. People grind their bodies against each other. Men
ride a few lady's backsides. Celie is so shocked by the
sight, she hides her face behind the fan. Mister, on the
other hand, is in heaven. People dance in sync while Shug
wipes her brow, takes a drink, and sings the last section.
The band picks up the melody as she walks among the crowd.

                    SHUG & ENSEMBLE (CONT'D)
          Now ladies (Push) I need you to
          work a lil' harder. (Push) Ok. I
          want you to reach down and (Pull) I
          need you to find your inner Shug,
          baby. (Push) There it go. There it
          go. All right now.

A few couples hop on tables and dance as Shug wails! Several
others crawl along the flo ors. Some even climbs the walls!

                    SHUG
          Ey! Push da button. (Push da
          button) Push da button. (Push da
          button) You gotta push it if you

          whatta you gotta do (Push da
          button) Push da button. Yeah!

EVERYONE APPL AUDS AS THE SONG ENDS.

Shug sits in Celie's lap. Mister looks on, jealous. Harpo
stands on the bar counter.
                                                        67.


                    HARPO
          Drinks on the house!

Folks cheer and crowd the bar. In all the commotion, Sofia
enters with a prizefighter named HENRY (BUSTER) BROADNAX. She
looks gorgeous and her gentleman friend is also a CATCH.

                    SOFIA
          C'mon, Buster! Let's find us a
          seat.

Harpo hasn't noticed her yet. He and Squeak are busy serving
drinks. Sofia takes it all in.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Would you look at what Harpo done
          here.

Sofia sees Celie.

                    S OFIA (CONT'D)
          Oooooh, Miss Celie!

Celie is elated to see her.

                    CELIE
          Sofia!

They embrace.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          This here Shug Avery.

                    SOFIA
          Nice to meet you, ma'am.

They shake hands.

                    SHUG
          Mutual. Who dis?

                     HENRY
          Henry Broadnax. But my people call
          me Buster.

                    SOFIA
          He's a prizefighter. Man was never
          knocked out till he met me.

They all laugh to ease the tension. Mister returns to the
table with drinks for he and Shug. He and Sofia make eye
contact. Their disdain for one another is still ripe.
                                                          68.


                    MISTER
          Shouldn't you be at home, tendin'
          to your baby?

                    SOFIA
          Shouldn't you be somewhere with
          folks your age. Like a cemetery.

Harpo walks up to the table to thank Shug. Squeak is on his
arm. He sees Sofia and pretends not to be bothered by her
being with another man.

                    HARPO
              (to Sofia)
          How's my son?! Who I ain't seen in
          a month of Sundees.

                    SOFIA
          Our son is fine. You know where he
          be. If you want to see him, use
          your feet. Now I didn't come here
          for no mess. Came to hear Miss Shug
          sing-

                    HARPO
          It's scandless, you galavantin'
          `round town with another man when
          you still married to me. I hear you
          raisin' his chill'ren too and he
          got four mouths to feed plus mine.

                    SOFIA
          Six if you count our new baby.

                       HARPO & MISTER
          New Baby?!

                    SOFIA
          Yes, Lawd. Me and Buster had us a
          girl. Oh look, there's a seat.

Sofia and Buster walk away. Squeak sees the jealousy on
Harpo's face.

                    HARPO
              (to the piano player)
          Play somethin' with a slow drag,
          Jaw Bone. Folks want to dance
          close.
                                                          69.


MUSIC PLAYS.

Harpo stares at Sofia and Buster. Mister and Shug converse.
Celie drinks moonshine and is disgusted. Harpo approaches
Sofia.

                    HARPO
          Thanks for comin. I'se sorry, I
          gots off on the wrong foot just
          now. Care to shake a leg? Let me
          make up for it?

Sofia looks at Buster who shrugs. She sighs, grabs Harpo's
hand and they walk to the dance floor. They dance close.
Eventually, Squeak steps to t hem, pissed.

                    SQUEAK
          Harpo, who dis woman?

                    HARPO
          You know who dis is. Go somewhere
          and be nice. Me and Sofia just
          findin' our rhythm.

                    SQUEAK
          But I wants to dance too!

Sofia breaks from Harpo.

                    SOFIA
          Fine with me.

Sofia starts to walk away but Harpo grabs her.

                    HARPO
          You don't have to go nowhere. This
          used to be your house!

Everyone in the juke joint starts to stare! People murmur.

                    SQUEAK
          What you mean her house?! You said
          this was our house. She walked
          away, took your baby, and left you
          a cryin' shame. Now you mine.

Dead silence! Sofia takes a breath, swallows her pride.

                    SOFIA
          Like I say. Fine. with. me.

Sofia starts to leave again but Harpo pulls her closer. They
dance a few more steps. Squeak pushes Harpo. Sofia touches
Squeak to calm her down.
                                                        70.


                    SQUEAK
              (To Sofia)
          Don't touch me, you snaggle-tooth
          heifer!

She SLAPS Sofia! Everyone GASPS!

                    BUSTER & MISTER
          Time to go.

Sofia stares at Squeak. Buster rises, heads toward Sofia.

                    BUSTER
          Momma bear, don't do nothin' rash.

Sofia steps to Squeak. Half the juke hurries out. The other
half slowly hides under tables.

Sofia CHARGES at Squeak! They roll on the floor, FIGHTING!
Sofia decks Squeak with one punch, her legs go flying in the
air - she is knocked out. Mister shakes his head. IN ALL THE
COMMOTION, SHUG GRABS CELIE'S HAND AND EXITS THE JUKE.


EXT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Shug and Celie as they walk close. We hear
the distant sounds of brawling at the juke joint.

                    CELIE
          You keep singing at the juke, I bet
          Harpo make a lot of money.

                    SHUG
          Aw, he don't need me. That boy got
          a good head on his shoulders. He
          goin' places most folks never
          dream. `Sides, as much as I'd like
          to stay, Memphis callin'. If I
          don't remind folks I'm still alive
          in the big city, they'll forget
          about me.

Celie is gutted by this news.

                    CELIE
          I ain't ready for you to leave.
          Mister so much nicer when you
          around. He don't beat me as much.

                    SHUG
          Beat you? Why he do that?

Celie shrugs; looks at the ground.
                                                         71.


                    CELIE
          `Cause I ain't you, I guess.

                    SHUG
          You gots to stand up to him. You
          gots to try.

                    CELIE
          When you leavin'?

                    SHUG
          Tomorrow afternoon. But I'll be
          back in a month or so, you'll see.

Celie finally looks at her.

                    CELIE
          When you gone a hour, it feel like
          forever to me.

                    SHUG
          That's why I gots to come back.
          Nobody love me like you.

Shug opens her car door for Celie to step inside.

                    CELIE
          Where's we goin'?

                     SHUG
          Time fo r you to see more of the
          world.

Shug drives away. Celie smiles.


EXT. THE ELMIRA MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Shug pulls up to the cinema and screeches to a halt.

They walk towards the entrance with their arms linked.

They approach A WHITE TICKET BOOTH OPERATOR who sits in a
glass box.

                    WHITE TICKET BOOTH OPERATOR
          May I help you?

                    SHUG
          Two tickets, please.

Shug hands him money. He gives her the tickets.
                                                         72.


INT. THE ELMIRA MOVIE THEATER - MEZZANINE - CONTINUOUS

They sit in the front row of the balcony. NO ONE IS THERE BUT
THEM. A black and white movie plays. Celie is engrossed by
the screen yet she can feel Shug staring at her.

IMAGINED:

The shaft of light emanating from the movie projector pours
onto Celie, she glances at Shug and the CAMERA pushes into
the movie screen.


EXT./INT. KITTY HAWK PLANE - DAY

Celie imagines herself and Shug on screen instead of the
actress in the movie. She looks at Shug who is piloting the
aircraft. We hear a rousing score.

They fly off screen as...


INT. FILM STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The movie screen rises r evealing a stage. On both sides sits
an orchestra dressed in tuxedos and an art deco background.
Celie and Shug walk down the stairs to center stage dressed
in stunning gowns. They sing into box head microphones.
12. "WHAT ABOUT LOVE?"

                      CELIE
            Is that me who's floating away
            Lifted up to the clouds by a kiss
            Never felt nothin' like this

                      SHUG
            Will you be my light in the storm?
            Will I see a new world in your
            eyes?

                      CELIE & SHUG
            With you my whole spirit rise

                      CELIE
            And what about hope

                      SHUG
            What about hope

                      CELIE
            What about joy

                      SHUG
            What about joy
                                                           73.


CAMERA CLOCKS the musicians in the orchestra.

                    CELIE & SHUG
          What about tears when I'm happy
          What about wings when I fall

Then back to Celie and Shug.

                    CELIE & SHUG (CONT'D)
          I want you to be a story for me
          That I can believe in forever!!!

CAMERA SPINS around them. They sing to each other.

                    SHUG
          And what about...

                    CELIE
          What about...

                    SHUG
          What about...

                    CELIE
          What about...

                      CELIE & SHUG
          Love?

They move in closer and hold hands.

                    CE LIE
          What about...

                    SHUG
          What about...

                    CELIE
          What about...

                    SHUG
          What about...

                    CELIE
          What about love?


              CELIE (CONT'D)                  SHUG
You and me,                      You and me,
You and me,                      You and me and love now
Sing to me                       oh, oh, oh, oh

                    CELIE & SHUG
          What about...
                                                         74.


                    SHUG
          What about...

                    CELIE
          What about...

                     CELIE & SHUG
          Love?


INT. THE ELMIRA MOVIE THEATER - MEZZANINE - NIGHT

They are back in their seats, KISSING.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - NIGHT

Shug takes Celie into her bedroom and into her bed.

They kiss. Shug turns off the light, giving us the impression
that they will sleep together.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Celie is still asleep when S hug wakes in bed. She feels dawn
on her skin. She gets out of bed and slips into her robe.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY

Shug is about to make coffee when she sees the postman coming
up the road in a 1920s U.S. Mail truck.


EXT. ROAD LEADING TO MISTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

She meets the postman at the mailbox. He sees her in her robe
and is embarrassed. This tickles her.

                    SHUG
              (grinning)
          Mornin'.

S hug opens her hand to take the mail from him.

                    POSTMAN
          Albert around?

                    SHUG
          Naw. Probably passed out somewhere.

The postman nods his hat then leaves. Shug sorts through the
mail. She sees something that catches her eye.
                                                          75.


CAMERA FOCUS: On the return address. THE LETTER IS FROM
NETTIE IN AFRICA! Shug gasps!

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          Mercy to glory...

She rushes into the house.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - DAY

Shug bolts into the room, waking Celie!

                    SHUG
          It's from her!

                    CELIE
              (wiping her eyes)
          What's from who?

                    SHUG
          You got a letter. Celie, it's...
          ...it's from ya Nettie.

Shug hands her the letter. Celie looks at the return address.
Tears fill her eyes. She opens the letter, reads.

                    CELIE
          "Dear Celie, I hope this r eaches
          you, as I've been writing you every
          week for years. I suppose you
          didn't get any of my letters
          because you haven't written back."

Celie looks at Shug IN SHOCK.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
              (to Shug)
          She's alive. My Nettie, she...

Celie is so overcome she can't continue. Shug takes the
letter and helps.

                    SHUG
          "You probably won't get this
          either, because Mister is still
          probably the only one who takes
          mail from the box. B ut if you do
          get this, I want you to know, I
          love you, and I'm not dead."

Celie takes the letter, looks at it, clutches it to her heart
as tears flood her face.
                                                          76.


INT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - DAY

Mister is passed out at the bar. Harpo has just cleaned the
place after a long night of revelry.

                    HARPO
          Time for you to go home, pa.

Mister wakes, groggy. Harpo helps his father up.

                    MISTER
          Why you givin' way free drinks?
          It's bad for biz-ness. The point is
          to make money, not give it away.

                    HARPO
          I hear ya, pa.

Harpo escorts his father outside.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - SHUG'S ROOM - DAY

Celie is reading the letter again when Shug nudges her.

                     SHUG
          There's got to be more of `em
          somewhere.

They look at each other. They rush into--


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

--Mister's bedroom and hurriedly look for the other letters.
They look under the mattress. In his drawers. In his
suitcase. In his closet. Celie gets nervous.

                    CELIE
          He'll be back any minute.

                    SHUG
          Let's just t hink. If you were
          Albert, what piece of furniture
          would you value most?

They both look at the bed.


EXT. DIRT ROAD TOWARD MISTER'S HOUSE - DAY

Mister and Harpo are near the house. Mister is hungover and
can hardly walk. He leans on his son for strength.
                                                            77.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

The ladies pull the bed back revealing a crack in one of the
floor slats. Celie pulls up the slat and FINDS A LARGE TRUNK.

SHE OPENS IT AND DISCOVERS HUNDREDS OF LETTERS. She is
STUNNED. Celie embraces them.

                    CELIE
              (laughter and tears)
          My Nettie sho' not dead!

They hear the front door SLAM! Mister has entered the house.

                    MISTER (O.C.)
          Shug, baby!

                    SHUG
              (calling back to him)
          Just a minute! I'm coming down!


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Celie takes the letters into Shug's bedroom.

                    SHUG
          Take your time. I'll keep him busy
          downstairs.

Shug exits. Celie organizes the let ters according to date.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - HOURS LATER

Dressed in a fur coat and hat, Shug joins her band members in
the yard. They take her luggage to a truck and drive off.
Shug kisses Mister and embraces Celie.

                    CELIE
              (whispering in her ear)
          Take me with you.

Shug eyes Mister, who looks on, jealous. She can't do it.

                    SHUG
          Next time. I'll be back `fore y'all
          can spell Mississippi.

She gets into her co nvertible and waves "goodbye" as her
driver speeds down the road.
                                                           78.


EXT. DEADWOOD BEACH - LATER THAT DAY (SPRING, 1923)

Celie sits on a deadwood tree and reads a letter. 13. AFRICAN
HOMELAND.

                       NETTIE (V.O.)
             "Dear Celie, When Mister forced me
             off his land, I got a job working
             for a pastor across town. He and
             his wife needed somebody to see
             after their two children. I helped
             take care of their babies for food
             and shelter. Eventually, they told
             me they were going to Africa as
             missionaries and maybe I could go
             with them."

Celie looks up from the paper. She imagines the ship sailing
on the hor izon.

                       NETTIE (V.O.)
             "While we were on a great boat to
             Africa, the Reverend told me he and
             his wife couldn't bare children.
             But God sent them two. They showed
             me the name you had sewn on the
             baby's blanket and I knew the
             babies God had sent them were
             yours. It's a miracle! Adam and
             Olivia are right here with me!"

Celie is overcome by the news!

                       CELIE
             My babies, they're alive. They with
             Nettie!

ON THE BEA CH --

A wave crashes against the shore! She looks to the sea and
imagines Nettie, Pastor Samuel and Corrine arriving by a
paddle boat. She sees Nettie holding her babies.

They are welcomed by THE ASHANTI TRIBE, dressed in royal
regalia.

BARE-CHESTED DRUMMERS BEAT KETE DRUMS.

They're    followed by women dancing to the drum beat. A man
carries    a large umbrella that shades the Ashanti King. He is
flan ked   by a sword bearer and a staff bearer. The King,
wearing    a gold crown and kente cloth, sits on a palanquin
carried    by six men. The deadwood tree comes to life.
                                                              79.


Leaves sprout and flowers bloom. Celie is awed. She hears The
Ashanti tribe singing:

           ASHANTI TRIBE                          TRIBE
Agoo-aye                              "A-goo-AYE" (Are you out
Amee                                  there?)
Agoo-aye                              "A-meeer" (Yes, we are)
Amee                                  "A-gooo-AYE" (Are you out

                                      "A-meeer" (Yes, we are)

The kete drummers surround Nettie. She is overcome with joy.

                           ASHANTI TRIBE (CONT'D)
             Aye,   Aye,   Aye
             Aye,   Aye,   Aye
             Aye,   Aye,   Aye
             Aye,   Aye,   Aye

Celie continues to read the let ter.

                       NETTIE (V.O)
                 (overlaps following lyric)
             It was like black seeing black
             for the first time. Beautiful black
             people dressed kente cloth. And
             when they danced, it was like the
             folks in church back home.

           ASHANTI TRIBE                      ASHANTI TRIBE
Agoo-aye                              "A-gooo-AYE" (Are you out
Amee                                  there?)
Agoo-aye                              "A-meeer" (Yes, we are)
Amee                                  "A-gooo-AYE" (Are you out
                                      there?)
                                      "A-meeer" (Yes, we are)

The drum beat intensifies as th e dancers move to the rhythm.

                       NETTIE (V.O.)
             The little I knew about myself and
             my people wouldn't have filled a
             thimble. Celie, we are more than
             just kings and queens. The world
             began here. We are at the center of
             the universe.
                                                            80.

The horn of a Fishing Trawler WAKES CELIE FROM HER REVERIE.
BACK TO REALITY. The Ashanti Tribe has vanished. The b each is
empty.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Celie hurries into the house. She hides the letters and
tiptoes into the bedroom where Mister snores loudly.
                                                           81.


Celie slides into bed and the CAMERA STAYS with her. She is
overcome with joy, finally knowing her Sister is alive.


INT. GENERAL STORE - THE NEXT DAY

Celie shops in the General Store and sees MARY ELLEN, 16,
Alfonso's new wife. ALFONSO comes out of the back room. He
makes eye contact, but she averts his gaze.


EXT. BACK ROAD (MAIN DRAG, BLACK PART OF TOWN) - DAY

Celie continues to read Nettie's letter as she walks home.

                    NETTIE (V.O)
          Dear Celie, I hope this letter
          finds you well. Life has become
          dire for us. Our village was bombed
          in order to make way for a road to
          grow cocoa trees!

CELIE'S environment transforms to the village in Africa.

She imagines the Ashanti tribesmen and women marching away
from their village. BRITISH COLONIAL OFFICERS on horseback
oversee the village's eviction. Celie ima gines Pastor Samuel,
Corrine, and Nettie carrying her babies among the villagers.

                    NETTIE (V.O.)
          The British colonial administrators
          ignored our pleas to let us keep
          our land. We couldn't fight them,
          so now we walk to a refugee camp
          across the border.

Smoke from the smoldering village becomes smoke from a
locomotive train, snapping Celie back to reality on Main
Street. She continues to read the lette r.

                    NETTIE (V.O.)
          I have faith that God will let us
          see each other before we die.
          I only hope when that day comes, we
          are not too old to recognize each
          other.

Celie hurries towards her house.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

When Celie arrives, Mister is sitting at the table. She puts
a plate of food in front of him and places one for herself.
                                                        82.


                    MISTER
          Why supper late?

                    CELIE
          Lost track of time-

                    MISTER
          I works the land sun up to sun down
          - breaking my back. All you have to
          do is cook and clean and ya can't
          even do that.

                    CELIE
              (gritting her teeth)
          I'll do better.

                    MISTER
          That's what ya mouth say.

Mister pushes her plate on the floor.

                    MISTER (CONT'D)
          Clean it up! If I got to eat late,
          you won't eat at all.

Celie gets on her knees to clean up the mess.


EXT. MIS TER'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

Celie is raking leaves when Sofia, Henry, and their children
pull up in a car. Sofia honks.

                    SOFIA
          Miss Celie! Hop on in, we going to
          town!

                    CELIE
          I can't. Gots work `round the
          house.

                    SOFIA
          Work can wait. Come on, gal. I
          ain't seen you since Jesus wept.
          Get in here!

Celie thinks. Then in her first act of defiance, she proudly
gets into Sofia's car.


INT./EXT. SOFIA'S SEDAN - DAY

Celie sits in the back, sandwiched between Sofia's children.
                                                        83.


EXT. MAIN STREET - GAS STATION (WHITE PART OF TOWN) - DAY

Sofia, and her children eat ice cream cones as they lean
against the sedan. Henry pumps gas into the car's tank. Celie
sits in the back seat.

THE MAYOR pulls up to the gas station in a convertible. His
wife, MISS MILLIE, sits in the passenger seat. She SPOTS
Sofia's children and walks up to them.

                    MISS MILLIE
              (to Sofia)
          Are those yours? They so chocolate
          I could eat `em up. And so well-
          behaved. And clean. You should come
          be my maid.

                    SOFIA
          No and no, thank you. Come on
          chill'ren. Let's get in the car.

                    MISS MILLIE
          You sure? That's a lot of mouths to
          feed.

Sofia ignores her. Miss Millie is relentless.

                     MISS MILLIE (CONT'D)
          I'm Miss Millie in case you
          wonderin'. The mayor's wife. I'm
          sure you heard of me. If not, just
          ask around. The colored love me.
          I'l l pay you fair.

Henry can see that Sofia is getting riled up.

                    HENRY
              (to Sofia)
          Honey, just get in the car.

Celie stares out of the back window, as Miss Millie persists.

                    MISS MILLIE
          I'm talkin to you, gal! You wants
          to be my maid or not?!

Sofia stops with her back to Miss Millie. She thinks, then:

                      SOFIA
          Hell. No.

Miss Mille gasps! All the WHITE PEOPLE within earshot
grumble! The Mayor rushes to "protect" his wife.
                                                         84.


                    THE MAYOR
          What's that you say to my wife?

Sofia turns around, thinking maybe she's going to apologize.
But suddenly The Mayor SLAPS her! Sofia punches him without
thinking! He falls out cold. Miss Millie screams!

SERIES OF QUICK FLASHES:

-White men move toward Sofia. White women hurry to help The
Mayor and his wife.

-Celie helps the children into the car. She locks the rear
doors.

                    HENRY
          Come on, Sofia! G et in the car!!!

Sofia won't budge. She knows if she gets close to her
children they could be in danger as well.

                    SOFIA
              (to Buster)
          Get my chill'ren out of here!

Sofia is surrounded by the mob of White Men.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          GET MY CHILDREN OUT OF HERE NOW!!!

Henry is torn, but obeys.


INT./EXT. SOFIA'S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

                    HENRY
              (to Celie re: the kids)
          Don't let `em see.

Celie makes the kids squat down and cover their eye s.

MORE SERIES OF SHOTS:

-The white men close in on Sofia SHOUTING obscenities at her.

-Sofia balls her fists!

-They attack! She swings at them, defending herself.

-SOMEONE HITS HER WITH A TIRE IRON, KNOCKING HER OUT.

TITLE CARD: FALL OF 1923. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER.
                                                        85.


INT. LOCAL JAIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sofia sits behind bars. Her wounds have not properly healed
since the attack and her face is somewhat deformed.

Celie enters the corridor with food. She stops at Sofia's
cell and sits on a stool that's been put there for her.

                    CELIE
          Hey, Sofia. What you know good?

Sofia remains quiet and motionless.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I'se late. The weather
          outside is just awful. But yo u know
          I won't miss our visits come hell
          or heaven-take-me.

Celie smiles. Sofia does nothing.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          Sheriff said I could bring you a
          plate for Thanksgiving. He say you
          ain't ate in days.

She slides a plate of food into the cell.

                     CELIE (CONT'D)
          Made your favorites: yams,
          collards, turkey legs, hot water
          cornbread, black-eyed peas, and
          peach cobbler.
              (then)
          Harpo and Squeak been keepin' a
          close eye on your ch ill'ren. Buster
          was helpin' out but...figure he
          couldn't get over not defendin'
          you. It broke him some. So he up
          and left town. But Harpo love his
          kids like they his own. He been
          makin' lots of money down at the
          juke ever since Squeak started
          sangin'-

The hallway door cracks open. DEPUTY enters.

                    DEPUTY
          Time to go.

                    CELIE
          But I just got here.
                                                          86.


                    DEPUTY
          `Said, time to go.

A beat, then.

                    CELIE
              (to Sofia)

          somethin' for me, hear? I'm a get
          you out of this place, God's my
          witness.

MONTAGE: (SOFIA IN JAIL SEQUENCE)


EXT. JAIL - DAY

We hear the clanging sounds of jail bars closing. This forms
the beat for 14. "HELL NO (REPRISE)." Celie sings as she
walks away from the jail.

                    CELIE
          Girl child ain't safe in a family
          `o mens!
          I'm sick and tired how a woman
          still live like a slave.
          Oh, We better learn how to fight
          back
          While we still alive!

Tears flood Celie's eyes. She glances back at the jail.

                     CELIE (CONT'D)
          So all of us girls can beat back
          that jive!
          `Cause when a man just don't give a
          damn...Hell no!
          Hell, hell no! No, no, no, oh no!
          My Lord! My Lord! Hell no! No, no
          no!


INT. JAIL CELL/HALLWAY - DAY

CAMERA starts on Sofia in her cell. Celie, Harpo and their
young children standing there to visit. Heavy rain rattles on
the jail window.

A FEW MORE YEARS HAVE PASSED. Sofia's wounds have healed. We
see a snowstorm outside the jail window, Celie, Harpo and
Sofia's now older kids stand outside the jailhouse.

Sofia sweats in a hot jail c ell. The sun beams through the
jail window.
                                                         87.


We see Celie, Harpo, and Sofia's now young adult children.
The jail door creaks open. Miss Millie steps into frame.


EXT. OUTSIDE JAIL HOUSE - DAY

Sofia walks out of jail on Miss Millie's arm, Harpo and her
children are surprised to see how old she looks.

                    MISS MILLIE
          Aren't we proud of our Sofia? She's
          come so far, I've agreed to let her
          live and work for me till she gets
          on her feet.

Miss Millie waits for an applause. There is none.

                    MISS MILLE
          Well. Come on then.

Miss Millie heads to her car. Sofia follows, but not before
she embraces her children. Celie hands her a cardigan that
she made. HARPO AND SOFIA LOCK EYES. They embrace. HONK!

Miss Millie is in the car honking the horn.

                    MISS MILLIE
          Let's not dawdle.

Sofia tries to break from Harpo's arms but he won't let go.
He cries. She softly pushes him away then gets into the car
with Miss Millie. The latter drives off.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

BLACK HANDS open Nettie's latest letter. While we hear her
voice, we see sharecroppers picking indigo in Mi ster's field.

                    NETTIE (V.O.)
          "Dear Celie, The letters you've
          sent fill my days with joy. I know
          it must have been hard finding me.
          We've had to relocate several times
          over the years. I've decided it's
          best that me and the children make
          our way back home to you. The
          British have seized the East.
          Nationalist movements are on the
          rise. We lost our passports and
          documentation when our village was
          burned. Celie, we need your help
          getting back to The States.
                    (MORE)
                                                         88.
                    NETTIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          As soon as you get this, please go
          to the immigration office to prove
          our citizenship. You're our only
          hope."

Celie walks into the house and we realize the letter wasn't
being read by her. It was Mister!

                    MISTER
          I told you not to touch the mail?!
          Says here you been writing her.

He SLAPS CELIE! She falls at his feet. Mister leans over her.

                    MISTER (CONT'D)
          Shug be here shortly. Come shave
          me.

CLOSE ON Celie: Doubled over, holding her face. We see
Mister's feet walking away.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

FOCUS ON: A STRAIGHT RAZOR. Celie sharpens it against a
leather strap. Her hand is steady. Her eyes are cold. She
continues to sharpen the straight razor as...

Mister walks onto th e porch, WHISTLING. His lower face is
covered in shaving cream. He sits in a chair and leans his
head back. Closes his eyes.

Celie holds his chin up. She places the blade near his Adam's
apple. SHE IS JUST ABOUT TO SLICE HIS THROAT WHEN-

HONK! THE SOUND OF A CAR HORN!

Mister JUMPS UP, looks at her and realizes that Celie was
just about to slit his throat. Celie's hand is TREMBLING!
Mister rubs his neck, in shock. Now he's trembling! ANOTHER
HONK!

                       SHUG (O.C.)
          I'se home!


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DAY

A yellow convertible pulls up to the house. Shug hops out
with her new husband GRADY, 40-something, debonair and rich.
They walk up to the porch where Celie and Mister are.
                                                         89.


                    SHUG
          The minute after we gots married,
          Grady say, "honey, what you want
          for your honeymoon?" I told him two
          things: a new car and a drive to
          see my two favorite peoples for
          Easter.

She lets out a high pitch scream! She hugs them both. They
don't even smile. Grady steps forward, shakes their hands.

                    GRADY
          Shug talks about y'all so much, I
          feel like we already kin.

An awkward tension. Shug tries to break it:

                    SHUG
          Miss Celie, us married ladies now.
          What y'all got to eat?

Shug takes Celie's arm. They enter the house.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

Miss Millie speeds down the road in her automobile with Sofia
in the passenger seat. She drives to Mister's house. Then
breaks. Then backs up. She's finally letting Sofia be with
her family. Sofia gets out and slowly walks to the door. She
wears the card igan that Celie made for her. She looks worse
than ever.


INT. MISTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Easter dinner. Mister and Ol Mister sit at the heads of a
long table. Around the table sits Harpo, Grady, Sofia,
Squeak, Celie, and Shug. Sofia sits with her head hung low.

                    GRADY
          That was a fine supper, Miss Celie.
          I'm fuller than a tick on a big
          dog.

Grady releases a belly laugh! Celie says no thing. She hasn't
been herself since Mister hit her and a rage is simmering.

                    HARPO
          Sofia, we glad you finally home.
          You sure you don't want to eat?

Sofia shakes her head "no." Ol Mister smokes a cigar.
                                                        90.


                    SHUG
          It's come time for me to tell
          y'all, Me and Grady can't stay. We
          need to be on the road `fore dusk.

Everyone groans in protest.

                    MISTER
          Y'all just got here.

                    SHUG
          I know. But Grady got to get back
          to work tomorrow. Also... we takin'
          Celie with us.

                    MISTER
          Come `gain?

                    SHUG
          Celie coming to Memphis with us.
          It's time she saw more of the
          world.

Mister laughs. Then he realizes she's serious. He's angry!

                    MISTER
          Like hell! I'd die `fore I let that
          happen.

                    CELIE
          Good. That's just the going away
          present I been needin'.

                    OL MISTER
          Woah, son. Handle your woman. She
          found her mouth-

                    MISTER
          She just bein' stupid. What's
          gotten into you, dummy?

                    CELIE
          I done had enough of you! That's
          what's gotten into me. It's time
          for me to get free from you and
          enter Creation.

Ol Mister stands as if he's actually going to fight.

                    OL MISTE R
          You ain't gon' be talkin' to my boy
          that way in my house!
                                                           91.


                    CELIE
          Maybe if he hadn't been your boy he
          mighta turned out an inch of a man!

Mister RISES, RAISES HIS FIST to hit her. She stands up to
defend herself, holding A KNIFE. People panic! Shug tries to
take the knife to no avail.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
              (to Mister)
          You took my sister Nettie from me.
          You hid her letters all those years
          when you knew she was the only
          person love me.
              (to everyone else)
          She alive! My Nettie in Africa! And
          my chill'ren they with her `cause
          there's a God. And when they come
          home, all us together gon' beat
          your black ass!

                    GRADY
          I better start loading the luggage.

He leaves to do so. Shug cautiously takes the knife from
Celie.

                    HARPO
          Miss Celie, it's Easter. Let's try
          and be civil-

                    CELIE
          Your daddy made my life hell on
          earth! He ain't nothin' but a sack
          of dead horse shit and horse shit
          belong in t he ground.

Sofia releases a small laugh that GROWS into a holler!

                    SOFIA
              (still laughing)
          She called him a sack of dead horse
          shit! Now if that ain't worth the
          joy of laughter, I don't know what
          is. Harpo pass me them peas.

Confused, Harpo passes her peas. Everybody looks at Sofia,
stunned.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          Yes, Lawd. I wants to thank you,
          Miss Celie...for everything you
          done for me. I was feelin' my bad
          rottin' in that prison cell.
                    (MORE)
                    (MORE)
                                                        92.
                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          But you came and seen't `bout me
          every week without fail. That's how
          I knows there's a God. `Cause He
          gots to be livin' in you. Harpo
          pass me dat ham.

                    OL MISTER
          The women at this table done lost
          they'ze mind.

                    SHUG
          Jus' hush, you old toothless goat.

Celie and Shug rise to leave. Mister stands in their way.

                    MISTER
              (to Celie)
          You leave and you not gettin' a
          dime from me. Not a red cent.

Celie SLAMS her hand on the table!

                    CELIE
          Did I ever ask you for anything!?
          Did I EVER ask you for ANYTHING
          including your hand in marriage?!

Shug slowly puts her arms around Celie and escorts her out.

                    SHUG
          Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go now.
          Sofia can take care of this.

Shug and Celie exit the house.

                    SOFIA
              (while eating)
          Mmm huh. Sofia born to take care
          this. Y'all go on!

Squeak gets up. Harpo grabs her.

                    HARPO
          Where you going Squeak?

                    SQUEAK
          I wants to go to Memphis too.

                    HARPO
          And do what?

                    SQU EAK
          I wants to be a singer like Shug.
                                                         93.


                    HARPO
          So you just leavin' me? SQUEAK?

                    SQUEAK
          My name ain't Squeak. It's Mary
          Agnes.

Squeak shrugs. She exits. Sofia chuckles. She continues to
make her plate.

                    SOFIA
          Old Sofia home now. There gon' be
          some changes made!

All the men look at each other, shocked. Ol Mister smokes and
Harpo scratches his head. Mister runs outside.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grady puts the last of the luggage in the trunk . Celie, Shug
and Squeak are getting in the car when Mister approaches.

                    MISTER
              (to Celie)
          You'll be back! Shug got talent.
          And looks. All you fit to do is
          clean her slop-jar and cook her
          food. You not even that good a
          cook.

Mister is just about to grab Celie, when she turns around and
points two fingers at him. Cursing him. Her hand is steady.
Mister is afraid to move.

                    CELIE
          Until you do right by me...
          everything you think about
          gon' crumble!

Everyone is awe-struck, feeling the weight of the moment.
Celie gets into the back seat of the convertible and slams
the door. Grady, Shug and Squeak hurriedly get in. Grady
starts the engine. Mister runs up to Celie.

                    MISTER
          You'ze black, poor, you ugly, you a
          woman. I shoulda kept you under my
          shoe like the roach you is.

Celie won't look at him. She simply re plies:
                                                         94.


                    CELIE
          The jail you planned for me is the
          one you'll rot in.
              (no malice but insight)
          Everything you done to me. Already
          done to you.

As Grady drives off, she stands and faces Mister.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I may be poor. I may be black. I
          may even be ugly. But I'm here!

Mister watches as they drive away.

                    MISTER
              (calling after her)
          You'll be back!

the good times with her sister Nettie.


EXT. GEORGIA ROAD TO HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Grady's car turns off of a dirt road and onto a paved
highway.


EXT. TENNESSEE ROAD - MORNING

They pass a road sign that reads: "WELCOME TO MEMPHIS."

Grady pulls up to a Victorian house with a well-manicured
garden.


INT. SHUG'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Shug shows Celie her room. It is breathtaking.

                    SHUG
          If you ask me, this room gets the
          best sunlight.

                    CELIE
          Ain't never had my own room before.
          Afraid I won't know how to act.

                    SHUG
          Then just act natural.

Celie opens the shades. A glaze of sunlight falls over her.
THEY HOLD HANDS AS THEY WATCH THE DAWN. The sun shines!


EXT. MISTER'S LAND - INDIGO FIELDS - DAY

The s un is scorching the earth. SHARECROPPERS are working in
the fields, cutting Mister's crop, and keeping their heads
cool with straw hats and wet rags around their necks.

A SHARECROPPER EXAMINES A LEAF. IT LOOKS CHEWED. He looks at
more leaves. They're all chewed. He runs to Mister.

                    SHARECROPPER
          Boss, you might wanna come look.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

-Mister looks at leaves in his crop. All are chewed up.

-He moves further down the row and finds a colony of leaf
beetles hiding at the roots of several plants.

-He gets so angry he kicks the dirt and A PLAGUE OF LEAF
BEETLES FLY INTO THE AIR! The sharecroppers run off. Mister's
entire harvest is RUINED.

-He sets fire to the entire crop. Mister watches it burn. We
see the dancing flames and the rising smoke reflected in his
eyes.

                                                        96.


We can hear people CHEERING downstairs. A knock. Shug cracks
open the door and enters.

                    SHUG

African Americans in Memphis) await Celie.

                      EVERYONE
          Surprise!

Shug removes her hand from Celie's face REVEALING THE CROWD
OF PEOPLE AND A BIRTHDAY CAKE that Squeak holds.

                    SQUEAK
          Happy Birthday, Miss Celie.

Celie is elated! She blows out her candles and folks CHEER!
Shug presents her with a gift.

                     SHUG
          Here. This that little somethin'
          you scra tched out of my head.

Celie unwraps it, revealing a new vinyl record. Grady sits at
the piano and begins the chords for 15. "MISS CELIE'S BLUES."
Shug sings to Celie. Grady plays the piano.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          Sister, you've been on my mind.

Shug takes Celie by the hand pulls her close. We clock Squeak
flirting with Grady.

                     SHUG (CONT'D)

Celie and Shug embrace as everyone applauds.

THE PHONE RINGS! Squeak answers. She says something inaudible
then approaches Celie.

                    SQUEAK
          You got a call.

She hands her the phone.

                       CELIE

EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH ON A HILL - DAY

We see a WIDE SHOT of the facade as we hear Reverend Avery's
booming voice!

                    REVEREND AVERY (O.C.)
          Oh God, we thank you for the life
          of Mr. Alphonso.


INT. CHURCH ON A HILL - CONTINUOUS

We are at Alfonso's homegoing. Reverend Avery is standing
behind a podium giving the eulogy; handkerchief in hand.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          Bible say we ought to weep when a
          child is born and rej oice when a
          body goes to the dust. Because in
          death there is everlasting life for
          those who are pure in heart.

As he speaks, the CAMERA FINDS Celie sitting on a church pew
in between Sofia and Shug. We get the sense that the ladies
are there to support her. Shug holds her hand.

Mary Ellen, Alfonso's widow, sits in the front pew as she
stares at the closed casket. She is both grieved by the death
of her husband and somewhat grateful that she can start her
life anew. Near the casket, stands a funeral wreath and a
black and white photo of Alfonso - looking mean and surly.

Except for a FEW CONGR EGANTS who pride themselves on never
missing a church service - the place is empty as a whistle.

                    REVEREND AVERY (CONT'D)
          Mr. Alfonso... was a man... unlike
          any man I've ever known. He was
          hardworking. Diligent. He possessed
          a quiet demeanor.

                    SOFIA
              (under her breath)
          Yeah, quiet as a snake.

The reverend clears his throat. His way of cautioning Sofia.

                    REVEREND AVERY
          Sho. He could be difficult and
          stubborn.

                    SOFIA
          Now you preachin'!
                                                        99.


Shug SHUSHES Sofia. She responds by snapping her fan open and
fanning herself. The reverend is grateful that his daughter
has come to his aide. Shug stares at him, hoping he would
glance in her direction. He doesn't. He continues...

                    REVEREND AVERY
          I'd be a lie, if I said I was
          certain Mr. Alfonso made it to The
          Pearly Gates. But what I do know,
          is that if we don't forgive, and
          ask for forgiveness fr om others...

We can tell his words are affecting Shug. Celie holds Shug's
hand even tighter. Shug perks up hoping her father will
finally look at her... but he doesn't. Not yet.

                    REVEREND AVERY (CONT'D)
          ...God will be hard-pressed to show
          His mercy toward us. So don't
          tarry, church!

He finally looks in Shug's direction.

                    REVEREND AVERY (CONT'D)
          For no man knows the day nor the
          hour when we will see our father
          again. Amen.

He nods to an ORGANIST to play, implying that he is done.


EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH ON A HILL - FRONT STEPS - DAY

People gather. A hearse is parked on the lawn. Celie and Mary
Ellen embrace. She whispers something in Celie's ear as...

                    SOFIA
              (to Shug)
          Your pa sho know he can preach. But
          all that talk of hell got me
          thirsty! Let's us mosey to the juke
          for a drank.

Shug looks back into the church through the front door. She
sees her father walking toward her. She thinks he may speak
to her but S ofia grabs Shug's arm and walks toward Celie.

                    SOFIA (CONT'D)
          We go'in to drank. You comin'?

                    CELIE
          Y'all go `head. I'll be there soon.

Sofia and Shug head to the juke without Celie.
                                                       100.


EXT. THE GENERAL STORE - DAY (A WEEK LATER)

Back in town, a horse driven hearse carrying the casket of
Alfonso passes before Celie and Mary Ellen - Alfonso's widow.
The women wear all black.


INT. THE GENERAL STORE - MINUTES LATER

Celie peruses the store. It's dusty and unkempt. Mary Ellen
comes downstairs with a suitcase. She hands Celie keys.

                    CELIE
          What's this for?

                    MARY ELLEN
          It's for you of course. T he place
          is yours.

                    CELIE
          He didn't leave it to you?

                     MARY ELLEN
          No, ma'am. It what'in his to give.
              (then)
          You didn't know?

                    CELIE
          We wasn't exactly on speaking
          terms...

                    MARY ELLEN
          I see. Well. When I went to    settle
          Alfonso's will, I found out    from
          the lawyer, this wasn't his    land
          nor his sto'. Your pa built    this
          place and when he died, the    place
          went to your ma-

                    CELIE
          But Alfonso was my pa.

                     MARY ELLEN
          No, ma'am . I read the papers
          myself. The one your real pa drew
          up. Long before your maw met
          Alfonso. Your real daddy even put
          you and your sister's name on the
          deed. That's how I know this here
          land belong to y'all.

Celie is so shocked, her knees nearly buckle.
                                                       101.


                    CELIE
          I don't believe it. He... Alfonso
          whatin't my real pa. I had a pa and
          a mamma that loved me. Sweet
          Jesus... my people loved me.

Celie breaks into tears. Mary Ellen puts her hand on Celie's
shoulder.

                    MARY ELLEN
          I hope this place brings you and
          your sister comfort.

Celie nods, "thank you." Mary Ellen leaves with her suitcase.

A beat, then... Celie SCREAMS! Then she claps her hands and
holds herself to push back more tears. She closes her eyes.

SHE IMAGINES: HER MAMA STANDING BEHIND HER IN THE REFLECTION
OF THE WINDOW GLASS.

                     CELIE
          Ma, I got our home back. Now what's
          I gon' do?

PRE-LAP: CHIME OF THE BELL ON THE FRONT DOOR.


INT. CELIE'S FANCY PANTS SHOP - DAY (MONTHS LATER)

GRAND OPENING. A small crowd has gathered to celebrate the
opening of Celie's store.

CELIE SINGS 16. "MISS CELIE'S PANTS"

With the women in the shop, Celie slides across the floor
hanging onto a dress rack with wheels.

                    CELIE
          All I need's a needle and a spool
          of thread. Got about a million
          patterns in my head.

She slides by several ladies who hop out of dressing rooms
wearing fabulous pants! They all dance in sync!

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          All the ladies' legs are gonna love
          to dance. When they in Miss Celie's
          pants.
                                                        102.


                    SEAMSTRESSES
          Gabardine, velveteen, satin, or
          lace. Buttons and bows all over the
          place.

They toss buttons and lace into the air as if it were Mardi
Gras! Sofia crowns Celie with a headscarf-crown!

                    CELIE
          Styles that make you feel like a
          queen.

Seamstresses roll by on wheeled-platforms while sitting at
sewing machines.

                    SEAMSTRESSES
          That woman's a wiz with the sewing
          machine!

The women dance The Charleston, etc. The fabric of their
pants changes every few seconds!

                      CELIE/SHUG/SOFIA/SQUEAK/SEAMSTRESSES
          Who dat   say? Who dat say? Who dat?

          Who dat   say? Who dat?

Sofia enters on skates that match her pants, jacket, and hat!

                    SOFIA
          Lookit here, get out my way.
          Sofia's back, and I'm here to stay.

                    CELIE/SHUG/SOFIA/SQUEAK/SE AMSTRESSES
          In Miss Celie's pants!

Shug appears reflected in all of the dressing room mirrors,
wearing a different outfit in each mirror. Celie tries to
figure out which one is the real Shug until Shug taps her on
the shoulder from behind and spins her.

                    SHUG
          Girl, you swept out the mem'ries,
          Filled this place with joy.

Sofia pulls down a curtain revealing more shelves of fabric.

                    SOFIA
          In this big ol' st ore!

                    SQUEAK

                                                       103.


                    SHUG
          Mirrors shiny clean.

                    SQUEAK
          And a fittin' room
          Smell like sweet perfume.

                    SOFIA

                    SOFIA/SHUG/SQUEAK
          Done you wrong...

                    SOFIA
          And brought you to tears, made you
          believe you're not strong.

                    SOFIA/SHUG/SQUEAK/SEAMSTRESSES
          Strong.

                    CELIE
          But look . . .
          I said, look . . .
          Are you lookin'? . . .

                    SHUG

Celie snatches off her pants revealing another pair!

                    CELIE
          Look who's wearin' the p ants


INT. MISS CELIE'S FANCY PANTS STORE - DRESSING ROOMS

                    CELIE

          In Miss Celie's pants!

Celie does a split in mid-air releasing the final high note!
When she lands, Shug catches her. They kiss. There is a knock
at the door. Celie breaks from Shug to answer it.


INT. HARPO'S JUKE JOINT - NIGHT

Sofia clears tables at the juke. Harpo is counting money at
the bar. A band plays. Very few people slow dance. Sofia goes
behind the bar to put dirty jars in sud water. Harpo sees how
beautiful she is and dances seductively with her to the
music. She refuses him at first but quickly gives in. Soon,
she is taking the lead and he jumps into her arms. They
laugh. Their flirtation is interrupted by...

Mister walking on stage, drunk, playing his banjo. The band
gets annoyed. People bark at him for ruining the mood.

                      SOFIA
              (to   Harpo)
          Best do   something about ya paw. He
          been in   here ev'ry night this week
          causin'   a ruckus and raisin' Cain.

                    HARPO
          I know, I'll take care of it.

He winks at her. She bites her lip. Harpo walks up to Mister.

                    HARPO (CONT'D)
          Time to go, Pa.

Mister shoves him away. They scuffle a bit until OTHER MEN
help Harpo control him.
                                                        105.


                    MISTER
          Y'all don't know nothin `bout real
          music no how! I used to break
          hearts back in my day! Women used
          to toss off theyz drawers.
              (to Harpo)
          Tell `im boy. Tell `im how great I
          was. Coulda been in Shug's band if
          I wanted! If I didn't have to farm
          my grandpa's land...

Harpo puts his arm around his father but says nothing. He
escorts him out of the juke.


EXT. HARPO'S JUKE - NIGHT

IT'S RAINING. Harpo he lps his father home.

                    MISTER
          Had my doubts. `Bout you buildin'
          that juke, boy. But you done good.

Harpo has NEVER heard a compliment from his father.

                    HARPO
          You alright, pa?

                     MISTER
          `Course.

Mister shoves him away.

                    MISTER (CONT'D)
          Why you got your arm `round me like
          I'm old? I can get home myself.

Harpo stops, watches his father walk up the road in the rain.


EXT. MISTER'S LAND - INDIGO FIELDS - NIGHT

It's pitch black . LIGHTNING FLASHES. Followed by THUNDER!

It JOLTS Mister on his walk home. He tries to cover his ears
from the thunder and shield his eyes from the lightning. It's
as if they are yelling at him. The rain falls hard as rocks.

He tries to run but trips and falls. He balls up into his
knees. THUNDER CLAPS IN THE SKY. He trembles then crawls
toward his house in the mud, too afraid to stand to his f eet.
                                                           106.


EXT. MISTER'S LAND - INDIGO FIELDS - NIGHT

Exhausted, Mister passes out on the wet muddy earth.


EXT. MISTER'S LAND - INDIGO FIELDS - THE NEXT MORNING

He is awaken by the Postman (who is quite old now). Mister
realizes he slept on the ground all night. The Postman helps
him up. Mister stands, embarrassed.

                    POSTMAN
          You alright, Albert?

                    MISTER
          Yes, sir. Fell asleep lookin' at
          the stars is all.

Mister dusts h imself off as the postman hands him mail.

                    POSTMAN
          You take care of yourself.

Mister does not reply, he sorts through the mail. One in
particular catches his eye.

CLOSE ON LETTER: IT'S FROM NETTIE. Mister opens it and
quickly reads. Then he lets his eyes glaze over his burnt
fields then his house, which looks worse than it ever has.


EXT. MAIN STREET - OUTSIDE IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

Mister walks up the steps into the building. He wears an old,
worn-out suit.


INT. IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

He crosses a large foyer and goes up the spiral staircase.


INT. IMMIGRATION OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

H e waits outside the office. He's nervous and feels out of
place. A voice startles him.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER (O.S.)
          Mr. Johnson?
                                                        107.


INT. IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

Mister sits on the other side of the desk from AN IMMIGRATION
OFFICER, 40s, white and male. We start mid-scene:

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Even if we could find them, which I
          doubt, it'll cost you hundreds to
          get them here from Africa.

He hands Mister back the letters.

                    MISTER
          I see. Well. I thanks ya.

Mister starts to leave. Then a thought strikes him.

                    MISTER (CONT'D)
          Say, I gots some land . I could sell
          some of it and get the money.
          That'll help wouldn't it?

The Officer looks at Mister like he's a fool.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          If I were you sir, I'd put my money
          to better use.


INT. CELIE'S FANCY PANTS SHOP - NIGHT

Celie is sweeping when suddenly, THERE IS A KNOCK. She has
her back to the door...

                    CELIE
          We're closed.

The stranger goes away. She continues to sweep. A beat,
then... the stranger r eturns. Knocks again. Celie gets a look
at the person. They look familiar. She puts down her broom
and cracks opens the door.


INT. CELIE'S FANCY PANTS SHOP - DOORWAY - NIGHT

                    CELIE
          Albert?

                    MISTER
          Eve'nin'. Hate to bother...

                    CELIE
          Something wrong?
                                                         108.


He can't find the words. He hands Celie a box. Inside the
box, there are: A FEW NEW LETTERS FROM NETTIE, that SEPIA
PHOTO OF SHUG and THE TOY RATTLE. She looks at the items and
starts to turn away.

                    MISTER
          Naw. Uh. This gon' sound odd but...
          I come to try on some pants. I can
          come back another time if it's too
          much trouble.

Celie thinks, looks at the box, she gives in.

                    CELIE
          Come on in.

                     MISTER
          Obliged.


INT. CELIE'S FANCY PANTS SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Mister enters the store with a box of materials that belong
to Celie. He takes off his hat. Rubs his hand over his head
as a means to brush his hair. We've never seen this side of
him. He's nervous.

She is confused by this. She retrieves her tape measure.

                    CELIE
          You'll need to take off your coat.

He does. She wraps her tape measure around his waist. They
haven' t been this close in a decade.

He can't help but look at her. She has never been more
beautiful.

Or has she always been this alluring and he just failed to
see it? It's not just her beauty that enchants him, but her
ingenuity. Her smell, her eyes...

                    MISTER
          You... you lookin' nice... if I may
          say. Not just for your age neither.
          For any age. Looking... nice.

She ignores the compliment. Points to the sh elves.

                    CELIE
          You see some fabric you like?

He stares at the dozens on her wall. The choice is difficult.
                                                       109.


                    MISTER
          Why don't I just get the one that
          nobody ever buys? Help out your
          business some.

MINUTES LATER:

He's wearing the ugliest pair of pants in creation. He looks
in the mirror trying to put on a brave face. Celie giggles.

                    CELIE
          You sure you want to be seen in
          those? They're starting to make me
          itch and I ain't even wearing `em.

                     MISTER
          I don't mind. Might as well give
          folks somethin to laugh about.
              (imi tating them)
          "Y'all see Mister. I think he done
          took a job as a circus clown on
          `count of his new bloomers."

Celie LAUGHS.

                    CELIE
          Forgive me.

                    MISTER
          Worth it to see you smile.

She stops, surprised by his candor. Now he's too afraid to
look her in the eyes. Maybe he went too far.

                    CELIE
          I best be closin' the shop. It's
          getting late.

                    MISTER
          That it is.

He gives her cash to pay for the pants.

                      CELIE
          Thank ya.

He op ens the door and is just about to exit when...

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I'm throwing my annual Easter feast
          come Sunday. You're more than
          welcome to come by.
                                                          110.


                     MISTER
          I'd like that.
              (beat)
          Say, maybe someday... I don't
          know... if you feel up to it
          sometime, maybe you and I, we can
          go on a date or something.

Celie is stunned.

                    CELIE
          Uh. Let's us just be friends.

He nods, tilts his hat then walks away. Celie shakes her
head, grinning.

She examines all of the objects in    the box that Mister
brought. Inside, there is Nettie's    hat, a picture of Shug,
her baby's toy ra ttle - all things   that she treasures. She
puts on the hat. It fills her with    joy. She sings 17."I'M
HERE."

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I've got my sister, I can feel her
          now. She may not be here, but she's
          still mine. I know she still love
          me. Got my children, I can't hold
          them now. They may not be here but
          they're still mine I hope...
          They know I still love them.


EXT. CELIE'S FANCY PANTS SHOP - NIGHT

Celie sits on a chair on the porch near the store entrance.

                    CELIE
          Got my house, it still keep the
          cold out. Got my chair when m y body
          can't hold out. Got my hands doing
          good like they s'posed to. Showing
          my heart to the folks that I'm
          close to.

The moon is so bright. Celie sings her heart out!

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          Got my eyes though they don't see
          as far now. They see more 'bout how
          things really are now!

Celie looks up the road.
                                                       111.


                    CELIE (CONT'D)
              (looks up, sings to God)
          I'm gonna take a deep breath. Gonna
          hold my head up. Gonna put my
          shoulders back. And look you
          straight in the eye.

A crowd begins forming as people come to see who's singing.
They bring oil lamps. It's as if her voice is calling them.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna flirt with somebody. When
          they walk by. I'm gonna sing out!
          Sing out!!!

The townspeople surround Celie.

FROM ABOVE:

CAMER A SPINS AROUND THE LIT LAMPS ENCIRCLING HER.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I believe I have inside of me
          everything that I need to live a
          bountiful life.

CAMERA CAPTURES THE LIT FACES OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          And all the love alive in me. I'll
          stand as tall as the tallest tree.
          And I'm thankful for every day that
          I'm given. Both the easy and hard
          ones I'm livin'.

She spreads her arms.

                     CELIE (CONT'D)
          But most of all, I'm thankful fo r.
          Lovin' who I really am. I'm
          beautiful.

SHE KNEELS IN FRONT OF A LITTLE BLACK GIRL.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          Yes, you're beautiful.

WIDE SHOT: REVEALING THAT SHE IS ACTUALLY ALONE.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          And I'm here!!!

For the first time, she seems like a giant in the small town.
                                                         112.


EXT. MISTER'S HOUSE - MAIL BOX - DAY

Mister opens the mailbox, finds an invitation to Celie's
Annual Easter Picnic.


EXT. ROAD NEAR CHURCH ON A HILL - DAY

It's a few days before Celie's Easter Feast. Shug drives
slowly toward Celie's house.


INT. SHUG'S AUTOMOBILE - CONTINUOUS

She is fiddling with the radio, trying to find a tune to
soothe her soul when she hears familiar strains coming from a
piano in the distance. She stops her car.


EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH ON THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

She realizes that she is just a stone's throw from her
father's church. She gets out of the car, and follows after
the glorious melody from the piano. The song is familiar.
It's the signature song she and her father used to sing when
she was a girl. She smiles, hearing the piano.

                    SHUG
          Oh, pa. That used to be our song.

She cl oses her eyes. Letting the music feel her body.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          SPEAK MY LORD...
          SPEAK TO ME...


EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH ON THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

Shug stops at the threshold when she sees her father sitting
at the piano. His back is to her. She hesitates then enters.

                    SHUG
          I LOVE YOU, LORD...
          SPEAK TO ME...

Reverend Avery recognizes his daughter's voice. He STOPS
playing but he doesn't turn around. She walks to him and si ts
beside him at the piano. She sings. He plays.

                    SHUG (CONT'D)
          CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT...

They sing together as tears fall from Shug's eyes.
                                                        113.


                    SHUG & REVEREND AVERY
          AND YOU WONDER WHY. MAYBE GOD IS
          TRYIN' TO TELL YOU SOMETHIN' RIGHT
          NOW. OH YES!

She lays her head on his shoulder. He closes his eyes as if
God has finally answered his prayer.


EXT. THE GREAT ANGEL OAK - EASTER DAY

There is an extremely large and round table that surrounds
the ancient tree. The very tree where she and Nettie
frequented when they were young.

THE TABLE IS COVERED I N THE PHENOMENAL QUILT THAT CELIE HAS
BEEN SEWING THROUGHOUT THE FILM.

SERIES OF QUICK CUTS: People arrive. They all greet Celie as
a queen-like figure. They bring food to the table until a
feast appears that delights the eyes. Celie mingles like the
wise elder she is.

MINUTES LATER:

Celie SPOTS Shug with Mister. Shug is carrying liquor. She
kisses Celie's cheek.

Mister gives Celie a pie. He's wearin g the ugly pants he
bought.

                    CELIE
          I can't believe you wore those.

                    MISTER
          Thought it'd help scare away some
          of the flies.

She smiles. Mister and Shug sit on either side of her. Celie
is just about to say grace again when she notices something.

                    CELIE
              (looking to the distance)
          Now who's that? Most of the town
          already here.

                    MISTER
          I invited a few folks. Hope that's
          alright.

                    CELIE
          `Course. Everyone's welcome.
              (to folks at the table)
          Y'all make room.
                                                       114.


People move in closer and add chairs to the circle. Mister
and Shug exchange glances. They know something she doesn't.

A car stops in the distance. A middle-aged black woman gets
out. She lifts up her head and throws her beautiful voice
into the wind. She sings out: 18. "HUCKLEBERRY PIE
(REPRISE)."

                    NETTIE
          Hey, sista! Whatcha gon' do!?

Celie instantly recognizes the voice. Her body trembles! She
grabs onto the table for dear life.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          Goin' down by the river! Gonna play
          with you!

Celie gets up, walks then runs toward the voice. Everyone
around the table looks to see what is happening.

                    CELIE
          Sho nuff sun gon' shine.

Nettie and Celie run toward one another as tears flood their
eyes.


EXT. THE GREA T ANGEL OAK - CONTINUOUS

                    NETTIE & CELIE
          Gonna be grown ladies of the
          marryin' kind. Gon' be alright.
          Gon' be alright.

They run into each other's arms!

                       CELIE
          My Nettie.

                       NETTIE
          Celie.

They are crying, overcome with earth-shattering joy. Everyone
around the table has followed Celie and now stand a few feet
away, watching. When Celie and Nettie break apart, Celie sees
the others.

                    NETTIE (CONT'D)
          These are your child ren, Olivia and
          Adam.

They have her smile.
                                                          115.


                    OLIVIA & ADAM
              (West African accent)
          Momma / Momma it us / We love you,
          momma.

Celie hugs and kisses them. She refuses to let them go.

                    ADAM
          This my wife, Abena.

ABENA walks to Celie and kisses her hand.

                    ABENA
              (West African accent)
          Your presence blesses us, mama.
          You have grandchildren.

Seven black children of various ages run toward Celie,
laughing.

                      HER GRANDCHILDREN
          We pleased! / We pleased to meet
          you, Nana !

Celie kneels to them and embraces her grandchildren. She
lifts one of them up, (a toddler) on her waist.

                    CELIE
          My family home!

THE FEASTING TABLE:

Celie stands at the head of the table which now includes her
family and dearest friends. She says grace over the food as
everyone else sits and bows their heads. Her prayer is this
song: 19."THE COLOR PURPLE." She stretches out her hand!

                    CELIE
          Dear God, dear stars, dear trees,
          dear sky. Dear peoples, dear
          everything, dear God.
          God is inside me and everyone else
          That was or ever will be.
          I came into this world with God
          And when I finally looked inside, I
          found it. Just as close as my
          breath is to me.

Moved by her prayer, everyone at the table lifts their heads.

                      CELIE/NETTIE/SOFIA
          Rising...
                                                           116.


                      ADAM/OLIVIA
          Rising...

                      SHUG/MISTER
          Rising...

                    EVERYONE
          Like the sun
          Is the hope that sets us free.

Celie joins hands with them.

                    CELIE
          Your heart beat
          Make my heart beat

                    EVERYONE
          When we share love.

CAMERA CIRCLES THE TABLE and we see many of the people that
we were introduced to in the film: Harpo and Sofia, and all
of their kids (who are now grown and have kids), all of
Mister's children who are now grown, Mist er and Shug.

                    CELIE & EVERYONE
          Like a blade of corn. Like a
          honeybee. Like a waterfall.
          All a part of me. Like the color
          purple. Where do it come from?
          Now my eyes are open. Look what God
          has done.

CAMERA STOPS AT THE END OF THE TABLE WHERE IT STAYS ON ADAM
AND OLIVIA AND THEIR CHILDREN. They are all smiles. Happy to
be home. They smile at Celie, who smiles at them from the
other end of the table.

           EVERY ONE                            CELIE
It takes a grain of love, to        Grain of love. Mighty tree.
make a mighty tree. Even the        Smallest voice. Harmony. Like
smallest voice, can make a          a drop of water. River high.
harmony. Like a drop of             There are miracles. I.
water, keep the river high.
There are miracles, for you
and I.

                     CELIE & EVERYONE
          Like a blade of corn. Like a
          honeybee. Like a waterfall.
          All a part of me. Like the color
          purple . Where do it come from? Now
          my eyes are open. Look what God has
          done.
                                                         117.


CELIE IMAGINES HER DESCENDANTS OVER THE DECADES:

THE CAMERA ROTATES around the table revealing her offspring
in the 1960's along with the music and fashion of that era.

THE CAMERA ROTATES AGAIN, and this time we find ourselves in
the 1980's. The music and style has changed, reflecting the
times. Celie's descendants are now grown, some with their own
children.

THE CAMERA ROTATES ONCE MORE and la nds in the 2000's. Celie's
descendants continue to gather, giving us the impression that
they carry on this tradition every year and with each new
generation.

           EVERYONE                           CELIE
Like a blade of corn. Like a      Oh a blade of corn. Like a
honeybee. Like a waterfall.       honeybee. All a part of me,
All a part of me. Like the        yeah. Like the color purple.
color purple. Where do it         Where do it come from? My
come from? Now my eyes are        eyes are open. Look what God
open. Look what God has done.     has done.

Celie snaps out of her fantasy and we are back at the table
in 1940's. Celie takes Nettie's hand.

                    CELIE (CONT'D)
          I don't think us feel old at all.

                    NETTIE
          I think this is the youngest us
          ever felt. Yeah.

                       CELIE & ENSEMBLE (V.O.)
          Amen!

SKIES FADE TO BLACK.
